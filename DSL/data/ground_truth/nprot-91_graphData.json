Third, display the TOCSY slice defined by the (H, C) chemical shifts of each NOE peak in this cluster and check if the CH spin-pair of the NOE peak correlates with the C\u03b1 spin of this initial spin-system. If yes, the NOE peak is regarded as a sequential or intraresidue side chain NOE in this spin-system. The 13C spin of the CH spin-pair should also correlate with C\u03b1H\u03b1 of this spin-system via TOCSY. In some cases, this correlation cannot be detected because it is too weak or close to the intense water signal.

Typically it is possible to unambiguously recognize most glycine, alanine, threonine, valine, isoleucine, and leucine, which account for ~42% amino acid residues in a protein. Glycine can be identified according to its small C\u03b1 chemical shift, and sometimes two H\u03b1 peaks. Alanine can be identified based on its strong intraresidue C\u03b2H\u03b2-NH NOE peak, strong C\u03b1-C\u03b2H\u03b2 TOCSY peak, and characteristic C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 chemical shifts. For threonine, valine, isoleucine and leucine, classification can be easily done based on their characteristic side chain chemical shifts. In particular, the methyl groups of these residues always give rise to well resolved TOCSY correlations with other 13C spins. Some serine, lysine, arginine, and proline can be distinguished, provided that the C\u03b2H\u03b2 spin-pair for serine, C\u03b2H\u03b2, C\u03b3H\u03b3 and C\u03b4H\u03b4 spin-pairs for lysine, arginine and proline can be identified. Classify other residues into three groups: (Asp, Asn, Phe, Tyr), (Gln, Glu, Met) and (Cys, Trp, His) according to both 1H and 13C chemical shifts.\n If a spin-system contains too few peaks to be classified, leave it without classification.
