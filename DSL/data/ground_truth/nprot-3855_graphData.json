Split the color channel of the image and identify the pixel coordinate of individual MTP well\u2019s center using the red channel image. A mean of neighboring pixels (varies based on the resolution of the camera) from the center was calculated for all the channels individually. The composite mean PI (CMPI) was derived from the following color-weighted formula [CMPI = 0.7 MPIBlue + 0.2 MPIGreen + 0.1 MPIRed]. The desired PI was then determined as 255 \u2013 CMPITest Conc \u2013 CMPIBlank. Plot the resulting CMPI against their respective logarithmic CRP concentrations using the four-parameter logistic based standard curve analysis. Determine the concentration of unknown CRP samples on the basis of their PI from the resulting calibration plot.",
