            "content": "On the day preparations: (allow 2-3 hours)\nSolutions & preparation of materials:\n1.\n1 % formaldehyde solution\u2013 made freshly from paraformaldehyde (PFA). Note that PFA is a polymer of formaldehyde that must be hydrolyzed to be functional. This is done by heating the aqueous solution (60 \u00b0C) and increasing the pH (NaOH).\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 0.25 g of PFA\n(Sigma P6148 \u2013 500g)\nto 22.5 ml of double-distilled water in a 50 ml conic tube. Add one drop of 1M NaOH. Incubate in 60 \u00b0C water bath for at least 20 minutes. Invert every 5 min. or so to ensure all PFA is dissolved.\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Allow solution to cool to room temperature before adjusting the pH to 9.2 using 50mM boric acid (usually takes about 0.5 ml).\nc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 35 \u00b5l of Triton X-100 (0.15% final v/v). Make sure is completely dissolved before use. Triton X-100 is a nonionic detergent that bursts the nuclear envelope. This is done concomitantly with the fixation step (formaldehyde in this case).\nd.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 150 \u00b5l of a 500 mM solution of DTT\n(Sigma D9779 \u2013 10g)\nto the fix (final concentration: 3mM DTT)\nNote: good for 2 weeks in the refrigerator at 4 \u00b0C.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thaw out Tyrode\u2019s solution.\n3.\nPrewarm sodium citrate solution to 37 \u00b0C.\n4.\nPre-warm a staining humid chamber for 10 minutes before fixing eggs.\n5.\nEtch and clean microscope slides. Use ethanol or IMS to wipe slides to remove grease using standard laboratory tissue wipes. Use a diamond pen to i) draw a circle where you will place the oocyte; ii) label slide with patient ID and oocyte number.\nProcedure:\nThe following steps are carried out under the stereomicroscope on a heated stage \u2013 We use a minitub heated stage for the stereo miscoscope with an HT50 control unit.\nhttp://www.minitube.de/Products-Services/Canine/Heated-Stages-and-Warm-Plates/Control-Unit-HT50-for-heating-systems\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place the slides in 1% formaldehyde solution in a coplin jar to coat.\nLow humidity conditions are bad; if you work in a dry environment use a humidifier in the room.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using an 100\u00b5m micropipette, transfer the MI or MII oocytes to a 50\u00b5l drop of Tyrode\u2019s solution on the lid of a culture dish. Allow the eggs to sit in the drop for approximately 1 minute. Watch for loosening of the zona under a stereomicroscope.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the zona begins to slough off, carefully transfer the eggs though 2-3 drops of 0.9% sodium citrate to rinse off the Tyrode solution. The zona should be completely removed by the time the egg is in the last drop (pipetting the egg up and down to help zona removal). At this point the eggs will become quite sticky - use care while handling them to prevent bursting.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove slide from PFA, dab the end on a paper towel to remove excess solution, and place on stereomicroscope.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take the oocyte from the Na\n2\ncitrate solution using the micropipette and pipette onto the PFA-soaked slide within the etched circle (do this under a stereomicroscope).\nIt is important to limit the amount of media that is transferred, as it will dilute the formaldehyde solution solution.\nThe eggs should be seen bursting in the formaldehyde solution. If the eggs don\u2019t start lysing you can agitate the surrounding liquid with the pipette until you see the egg start to lyse.\u00a0Do not agitate too much as it will cause the chromosomes to spread excessively on the slide and cause unintended chromosomal loss.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking care to keep the slide absolutely flat, transfer slides to a humidity chamber (prewarmed) for gradual drying for several hours to overnight (we\u2019ve tested 2 hour to overnight and there\u2019s no differences).\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After slides have dried, add photoflo\n(Sigma 146 4510)\n(500 \u00b5L in 50 mL of water) to a Coplin jar. Then add your slides for 1 minute.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take slides out and air dry at room temperature on the bench for 10-20 min.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The slides can be scanned under phase or you can put DAPI on them to see the chromosomes. The slides must be stored at -20\u00b0C until staining."
