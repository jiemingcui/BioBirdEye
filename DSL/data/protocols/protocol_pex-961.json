            "content": "<p>\tGrowing evidence demonstrates that macromolecular assemblies driving critical cellular functions are regulated by mechanical forces. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of force-sensing within most macromolecular assemblies in cells are still unknown. Several innovative techniques allow to measure and generate forces on proteins <em>in vitro</em> or within cells <sup>1\u20134</sup>, but they cannot probe protein mechanical responses within crowded macromolecular structures inside the cell or confined at the interface with the extracellular environment.</p><p>\tSuper-resolution microscopy (SRM) and single protein tracking (SPT) techniques are ideal to study the dynamic organization of proteins at the nanoscale. There are two major classes of SRM: coordinate stochastic based on Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM: PALM, STORM, PAINT) <sup>5\u20137</sup>; or coordinate targeted (STED, RESOLFT)<sup>5\u20137</sup>. SRM and SPT confirmed, together with fluorescent tension-sensors, that proteins could be stretched under mechanical tension<sup>2,8\u201310</sup> in mechanosensitive structures. In parallel, stretchable substrates of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) have been coupled with optical imaging to investigate cell responses to external forces<sup>1,11,12</sup>.&nbsp;However, the simultaneous combination of SRM or SPT with cell stretching is extremely challenging, since it requires to combine glass-like optical properties with mechanical stability of the imaged plane during substrate deformation. </p><p>\tSMLM/SPT require the optimal signal to noise ratio of single molecules emission to attain the best spatial resolution (typically 10-50 nm)<sup>5\u20137</sup>. SMLM/SPT techniques are thus ideally performed in the total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) or oblique illumination modes using high numerical aperture (NA) short working distance oil immersion objectives matching the index of refraction of glass slides<sup>5\u20137,13,14</sup>. In addition, SMLM/SPT techniques rely on object reconstruction or tracking from thousands of imaging planes, which implies perfect mechanical stability of the sample while imaging. This is incompatible with large deformations and displacements of the substrate in the axis (Z) and plane (XY) of observation during stretching. </p><p>\tSimilarly, coordinate targeted STED/RESOLFT nanoscopy techniques perform better using high numerical aperture (NA) short working distance oil immersion or glycerol immersion objectives. Compared to SMLM/SPT techniques, STED like techniques will be less sensitive to drift, as they have low pixel dwell times<sup>15,16</sup>. However, mechanical drift stemming from multiple factors (e.g., motorized and piezoelectric stages) can greatly compromise the performance of the STED system, degrading signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution<sup>15,16</sup>. Thus, perfect mechanical stability of the sample has to be ensured throughout acquisitions. Once again, this could be incompatible with large XYZ deformations during stretching.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIn most commercial configurations, cell stretching is performed using macroscopic devices and images are acquired after fixation, or thick elastomeric substrates are stretched in combination with low NA objectives and upright microscopes<sup>17,18</sup>. These low magnification configurations are quite permissive to slight defocusing <sup>19</sup>. Various custom-made devices could potentially enable simultaneous stretching and live cell imaging <sup>1,11,19\u201322</sup>. However, they are either limited to low-magnification imaging or are incompatible with continuous automatic focusing during stretching</p><p>\tHere, we present a cell stretching device compatible with SRM and SPT which enables to study the nanoscale reorganizations and deformations of protein assembly or individual proteins inside mechanosensitive structures<sup>23</sup> (Fig. 1a). This device is composed of an ultra-thin Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer (10 \u00b5m) providing glass-like optical properties compatible with SRM and SPT (Fig. 1b,c). To simultaneously enable substrate stretching and ensure flatness upon deformation, this ultra-thin PDMS layer is deposited on a glycerol-lubricated glass cover-slip (Fig. 1b,c). Glycerol allows the deformable substrate to float freely while avoiding PDMS adhesion and refractive index mismatch.&nbsp;A drop of glycerol is sandwiched between the plasma cleaned PDMS sheet and glass coverslip forming a glycerol layer of \u223c 0.7 \u00b5m in thickness (Fig. 1c) To manipulate the thin PDMS substrate and avoid any distortions along the optical path, the size of the observation chamber is kept as small as possible (\u223c9 mm2 (Fig. 1b)), and its mechanical stability is reinforced by adding a thicker (40 \u00b5m) Gel-Pak frame on top of the thin PDMS sheet (Fig. 1c). To generate uniaxial stretches on the glass-PDMS assembly, we design a 3D-printed micro-device (Fig. 1a,b). The micromechanical device consists of a fixed (holding) arm and a mobile (stretching) arm, connected to a piezo motor, positioned on opposite sides of the observation chamber on the PDMS frame (Fig. 1a,b). A clamp fixes the glass-PDMS slide to the base of the device and to the holding arm (Fig. 1a). The observation chamber or the whole microchip can be filled with culture or observation medium.</p><p>\tOur micromechanical stretching device is compatible with the two major classes of SRM: coordinate stochastic (e.g. PALM, STORM, PAINT) and coordinate targeted (e.g. STED)<sup>5\u20137,24</sup> (Fig.2). Experiments can be divided into two main approaches: 1) live stretching and SRM/SPT imaging in live cells (Fig. 2a-c) and 2) live stretching followed by rapid fixation, labelling and SRM imaging (Fig.2d,e). </p><p>\tConcerning the first approach, we can perform SPT acquisitions in cells before and after large (10-50%) or small (2-5%) stretches to study the effect of external stress on protein dynamics and diffusive properties (Fig. 2a). In addition, we can also perform simultaneous live cell stretching (2-5%) and SPT to study acute mechanical response of individual proteins: 1) force-dependent protein unfolding or deformations (Fig. 2b); or 2) force-dependent protein recruitments and reorganizations. Finally, the device can also be used to acquire STED SRM images of live cells that experience stretching (Fig. 2c). Regarding the second approach, the device can be used to perform SRM (e.g. DNA-PAINT, STED, STORM) in fixed cells after live stretching (2-50 %) followed by rapid fixation and labelling for SRM (Fig. 2d,e). </p><p><br></p>"

For that, select a region with a good density of fluorescent beads and acquire a snapshot. Measure the distance between two beads in the same horizontal axis (D\nbefore\n). Apply a test stretching by displacing the linear stage of the piezoelectric motor while keeping the same region in focus, either manually or with a custom-written Metamorph routine. Take another snapshot after the stretching and measure again the distance between the same two beads (D\nafter\n). If D\nafter\nis larger than D\nbefore\n, then the device is working properly. After that, cell stretching can be performed.\na.\nNote:\nStretching percentage is calculated by\n, a formula which can be applied for all stretching experiments in order to determine stretching percentage.\nb.\nNote:\nBy knowing the displacement and the percentage for the test stretching, it is possible to determine with reasonable precision the necessary displacement to obtain a desired stretching percentage when performing actual cell stretching.\nc.\nNote:\nStep size and speed of motor displacement should be kept consistent throughout all acquisitions.\nLive cell stretching combined with super-resolution microscopy and single protein tracking\nStretching and live sptPALM\nCells are imaged at 37\u00b0C in the micromechanical device. Here, an inverted motorized microscope (Nikon Ti) was used, equipped with a CFI Apo TIRF 100x oil, NA 1.49 objective and a perfect focus system PFS-2), allowing long acquisition in TIRF illumination mode. For photoactivation localization microscopy, cells expressing mEos2/tdEos tagged constructs were photoactivated using a 405 nm laser (Omicron) and the resulting photoconverted single molecule fluorescence was excited with a 561 nm laser (Cobolt Jive). Both lasers illuminated the sample simultaneously. Their respective power was adjusted to keep the number of the stochastically activated molecules constant and well separated during the acquisition. Fluorescence was collected by the combination of a dichroic and emission filters (dichroic: Di01-R561, emission: FF01-617/73, Semrock) and a sensitive EMCCD (electron-multiplying charge-coupled device, Evolve, Photometric). The acquisition was steered by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) in streaming mode at 50 Hz. GFP-paxillin was imaged using a conventional GFP filter cube (excitation: FF01-472/30, dichroic: FF-495Di02, emission: FF02-520/28, Semrock).\n1.\nFor simultaneous stretching and sptPALM with trapeze like patterns\n: select a cell and launch a PALM acquisition at high frequency (50 Hz) for the entire field of observation. The duration of the acquisition should comprise the entire trapeze pattern (at least 2500 frames).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several hundred frames after, stretch by displacing the linear stage of the piezoelectric motor. \u00a0Maintain the cell in the field of observation by compensating for XY displacements using manual repositioning (Nikon stage steered by a joystick) or automated stage repositioning (custom plugin developed in Metamorph). After the stretching has stopped, allow the plateau phase to last for 8-12 seconds before relaxation.\na.\nNote:\nWhen looking at focal adhesions (FAs), select cells with most of their FAs aligned almost parallel to the stretching axis in the field of observation.\nb.\nNote:\nImaging cells closer to the holding arm requires smaller XY repositioning while allowing to reach 6 % stretching.\n1.\nFor sequential large stretching and sptPALM (Before vs After):\nselect a cell and, after acquiring an image of the GFP reporter, launch a PALM acquisition at high frequency (50 Hz) for the entire field of observation throughout 4000 frames.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perform large stretching (10-50%) while following the cell displacement with the combination of a dichroic and emission filters (dichroic: Di01-R561, emission: FF01-617/73, Semrock). After stretching is finished, acquire an image of the GFP reporter (to have a perspective of the morphological changes) and launch another sptPALM acquisition.\nStretching and live STED\nCells are imaged at 37\u00b0C in the micromechanical device. Here, an inverted confocal microscope (Leica SP8 WLL2) was used, equipped with a HC PL APO CS2 motCORR 93X Glycerol, NA 1.3 objective. The confocal microscope was equipped of a white light laser 2 (WLL2) with freely tuneable excitation from 470 to 670 nm (1 nm steps). Scanning was done using a conventional scanner (10Hz to 1800 Hz). The confocal microscope was equipped with the STED module tunable to STED microscopy. A two-dimensional (2D) STED donut was generated using a vortex phase plate. This STED microscope was equipped with 3 depletion lasers: 592 nm, 660 nm and 775 nm For STED microscopy, cells were imaged with a combination of a WLL2 laser and a 775 nm depletion laser. Fluorescence was collected with an internal hybrid detector. The acquisition was steered by LASX Software (Leica).\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perform live labelling of the target protein on the micromechanical device. For actin or tubulin labelling, use SiR-Actin or SiR-Tubulin compounds, according to previous studies and manufacturer\u2019s instructions\n25\n.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the labelling, wash the staining solution and incubate the device in warm Ringer solution until the experiment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After bead incubation and mounting of the sample as previously described, select a cell and acquire a confocal image followed by a STED image on a sub region of the cell (pixel size has to be inferior to 20 \u00b5m).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stretch the cell according to the desired percentage (e.g. 4 or 30%) and maintain the cell on the field of observation by observation by compensating for XY displacements using manual repositioning (Leica stage steered by a joystick)\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After stretching, acquire a new confocal image followed by a STED image for the same sub region.\nSuper-resolution microscopy in fixed cells with large stretches\nThe following steps are required to perform large and sustained stretching followed by rapid cell fixation.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Warm 4% PFA with 0.25% Glutaraldehyde at 37\u00b0C.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After mounting the micromechanical device on the microscope, acquire several low resolution images of GFP markers for different cells.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove the entire module (device and motor in the stage-adapted holder) and stretch the cells outside the microscope. Immediately after stretching, remove the Ringer solution and fix the cells in warm 4% PFA with 0.25% Glutaraldehyde.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After fixation, rinse 3-4X with PBS.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clamp the stretching arm to the holding arm using the thread and groove system and two M3 screws. Afterwards, remove the screw that connects the stretching arm to the motor. With this, stretching is sustained throughout all the subsequent labelling steps and super-resolution imaging.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Label target proteins according to the imaging technique.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After labelling, and before performing super-resolution imaging, acquire again several low resolution images of GFP markers for the same cells.\nDNA- PAINT on fixed cells with large stretches\nCells are imaged at 25\u00b0C in Buffer C\nin the same microscope used for live sptPALM. Cy3B-labelled strands were visualized with a 561 nm laser (Cobolt Jive). Fluorescence was collected by the combination of a dichroic and emission filters (dichroic: Di01-R561, emission: FF01-617/73, Semrock) and a sensitive sCMOS (scientific CMOS, ORCA-Flash4.0, Hammatasu). The acquisition was steered by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) in streaming mode at 6.7 Hz. Vimentin-GFP was imaged using a conventional GFP filter cube (excitation: FF01-472/30, dichroic: FF-495Di02, emission: FF02-520/28, Semrock). Super-resolution DNA-PAINT reconstruction and drift correction were carried out as described before, using the software package Picasso\n24\n.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dilute the desired imager strand in Buffer C. For instance, Vimentin-Halo was visualized with Cy3B-labelled DNA imager strands.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate the micromechanical device with 200-300 \u00b5L of 90 nm gold nanoparticles, diluted in PBS with a 1:5 ratio, for 15 min at RT. Gold nanoparticles serve as fiducial markers\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash 3X with PBS and 1X with Buffer C.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add imager strands to the stretching chamber until reaching the ideal density of blinking events. Vimentin-Halo was visualized with Cy3B-labelled DNA imager strands, added to the stretching chamber at variable concentrations (2-5 nM), as previously described\n24\n.\nSTED on fixed cells with large stretches\nCells are imaged at 25\u00b0C in PBS 1X in the same microscope used for live STED, with the same combination of a WLL2 laser and a 775 nm depletion laser."

Since resins used for SLA are photoactivable at UV light, they can also be excited by the 405 nm laser used for sptPALM. Detachment of particles from the 3D-printed micro-device will therefore be visible and might interfere with the mEos /tdEos signal. There is no clear information about fluorescence of different SLA resins so, if autofluorescence persists, two possibilities exist. First, the entire holding arm can be covered with Dow Corning\u2122 High-Vacuum Grease, which prevents release of autofluorescent particles. Alternatively, other resins can be tested, such as Black (Formlabs). </p><p><strong>PDMS is not stretched</strong></p><p>Case 1: During PDMS elastic substrate production, air bubbles formed when Gel-Pak frame was brought in contact with 10 \u00b5m PDMS layer on the silicon wafer. Usually this will generate irregularities in the substrate which, if close to the 3x3 mm observation chamber, will affect the stretching. </p><p>Case 2: Glycerol coating was incomplete and thus PDMS adhered to the glass. </p><p>Case 3: Plasma cleaning of PDMS elastic substrate was not effective (either too long or too short) and thus PDMS is not gliding on glycerol. </p><p>Case 4: Stretching arm was not properly attached to the glass-PDMS assembly </p><p><strong>Sustained stretching causes the micromechanical device to rupture or leak</strong></p><p>The groove and thread system is still rather preliminary and requires further optimization, since it causes pressure on the micro-device, leading to leakage of liquid from inside of the device. Different designing strategies can be developed to sustain stretching, such as two 3D-printed clamps from the side and an adjustable screw in the middle, or simply a 3D-printed rod that blocks the recoil of the arm. </p><p><br></p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Cell mechano-sensing is based on biomolecule deformations and reorganizations, yet the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) and single protein tracking (SPT) techniques reveal the dynamic organization of proteins at the nanoscale. In parallel, stretchable substrates are used to investigate cellular responses to mechanical forces. However, simultaneous combination of SRM/SPT and cell stretching has never been achieved. Here, we present a cell stretching device compatible with SRM and SPT, composed of an ultra-thin Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer. The PDMS sheet is gliding on a glycerol-lubricated glass cover-slip to ensure flatness during uniaxial stretching, generated with a 3D-printed micromechanical device by a mobile arm connected to a piezoelectric translator. This method enables to obtain super-resolved images of protein reorganization after live stretching, and to monitor single protein deformation and recruitment inside mechanosensitive structures upon stretching. This protocol is related to the publication \u2018Cell stretching is amplified by active actin remodeling to deform and recruit proteins in mechanosensitive structures\u2019, in Nature Cell Biology. </p><p><br></p>",
