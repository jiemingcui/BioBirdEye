            "content": "Detection of functional complex formed by direct physical interaction between protein molecules forms the basis of understanding various signaling pathways as well as cross talk between different pathways. GST <sup>1</sup>pull-down assay is an important technique useful for both confirming the protein-protein interaction predicted by other research techniques \\(e.g., co-immunoprecipitation, yeast two \r\n\n\nhybrid etc.) as well as for screening  of  novel /unknown protein \r\n\n\ninteractions<sup>2, 3</sup>. Pull-down assays are a kind of affinity purification that not only enhance the efficiency of protein purification but also can be used simultaneously to perform a pull-down, or co-purification, of potential binding partners. In GST pull-down assay, a GST tagged bait protein is immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads followed by incubation with a protein source that contains putative \"prey\" proteins, such as a cell lysate. The source of prey protein at this step depends on whether the researcher is confirming a previously suspected protein-protein interaction or identifying an unknown interaction. The protein complex protein eluted from the beads are resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Comassie brilliant blue R250 or G250 or with Silver. The protein bands excised from the gel is subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion protocol <sup>4, 5</sup>. The digested peptides mixture are analyzed byMALDI-MS or LC-MS/MS \\(termed \u2018\u2018GeLCMS\u2019\u2019). \r\n\n\nWe describe herein a detailed protocol for GST pull down and in gel trypsin digestion suitable for identification of interacting proteins by MALDI-MS or LC-MS/MS."

D 600  of  0.6  is achieved.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Induce the culture with 0.3mM conc. of IPTG for 4 hrs. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 5500 rpm at 4\u00b0 C for 15 min.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Wash the cells twice with 1 X PBS. Resuspend the pellet in protein extraction buffer. Add lysozyme to the concentration of 1mg/ml and incubate on ice for 30 min. with occasional mixing in between.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add Triton X 100 \\(0. 2%) and DNase \\(5\u00b5g/ml) to the above mix followed by vigorous shaking.\r\n\n\nIncubate for 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C with gentle shaking to solubilize the fusion protein.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Spin at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Clarify the above supernatant by filtration through 0.4\u00b5 filters.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote: Cell lysate from BL21 expressing GST \\(Empty pGEX4T-2) is used as control to compare with the cell lysate expressing GST fusion protein. Both samples are processed simultaneously \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Immobilization of bait protein_ \\(GST/GST fusion protein)\r\n\n\n\u2022 Prepare 50% slurry of Glutathione Sepharose 4B from 75% slurry. Gently shake the vial of Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin to suspend the slurry. Transfer 1.33ml of slurry into a 15ml Falcon tube for generating 1ml bed volume.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Spin at 2100 rpm for 5min. Decant the supernatant carefully  and add 10 bed volume of ice cold 1X PBS  and mix well by inverting. Spin at 2100 rpm for 5 min. followed by decanting of\r\n\n\nsupernatant.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Repeat the above step 2 more times.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Finally, add 1.0 ml of 1X PBS to the above slurry to prepare 50% slurry. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Incubate the clarified crude cell lysate expressing GST or  GST fusion protein \\(described above) with 50% slurry for 2-4 hours at 4\u00b0 C with gentle shaking\r\n\n\n\u2022 Spin at 500 x g for 5 min. Wash the column three times with 10 bed volume of  ice cold 1X PBS.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Incubation of cell lysate \\(consisting of interacting prey protein) with immobilized bait protein_\r\n\n\n\u2022 Prepare the cell lysate according to the source organism. For bacteria, the method described above can be followed.  However, yeast cells can be disrupted by glass beads and plant cells can be crushed in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add the clarified cell lysate to   the Glutathione Sepharose 4B column with immobilized GST/ GST fusion protein and incubate for 2-4 hours at 4\u00baC.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Spin at 500 x g for 5 min. Wash the column  three times with 10 bed volume of ice cold 1X PBS.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Elute the interacting protein complex by incubating with 1 bed volume of glutathione elution buffer for 15 min. at RT and spin at 500 x g.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Repeat this step twice. Collect each elute separately.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Separation of interacting protein complex on SDS- PAGE gel**\r\n\n\n\u2022 The elutes thus obtained  both from column containing both immobilized GST and GST fusion proteins are loaded adjacent to each other on a 10% SDS PAGE gel with appropriate molecular weight marker. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Stain the gel with either silver stain or Comassie.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Excise the protein bands from the gel for further processing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**In-gel protein digestion for mass spectrometry**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Excising and destaining of gel pieces_\r\n\n\n\u2022 Wash the gel with sufficient water and place it on a light box to excise the desired bands with a clean scalpel.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Cut the bands in to small pieces \\(1x1 or 2x2mm) and transfer into a microcentrifuge tube containing water. Tube can be stored at 4\u00baC until further processing.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 200\u00b5l of destaining solution to the gel pieces and keep at 37\u00baC for 30 min. with slow shaking.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Discard distaining solution and repeat the step.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 200 \u00b5l 100% ACN to the gel pieces and incubate for 10 min with occasional shaking. The gel pieces should now appear white \\(translucent).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Remove ACN from the tube.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Reduction and alkylation of gel pieces_\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 100-200 \u00b5l of reducing buffer and incubate at 60 \u00baC for 1 hr.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Remove the reducing buffer and allow to cool at room temperature.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 200 \u00b5l of alkylating buffer for 30 min. in dark at room temperature.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Remove and discard alkylating buffer\r\n\n\n\u2022 Wash the sample by adding 200 \u00b5l of destaining solution and incubate at 37\u00baC for 15 minutes. Then discard destaining solution.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Repeat the above step once more.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Shrink gel pieces_\r\n\n\n\u2022 Shrink gel pieces by adding 50-100 \u00b5l of acetonitrile. Incubate sample for 15 minutes at room temperature. The gel pieces should now become white \\(translucent).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Carefully remove acetonitrile and allow gel pieces to air dry for 5-10min.\r\n\n\nTrypsinization of proteins and recovery of fragments\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 10 \u00b5l of the trypsin solution to the tube containing the shrunken gel pieces. Incubate in ice for 10 min and allow gel pieces to swell and absorb the trypsin solution. If 10 \u00b5l is not sufficient to cover and fully swell gel pieces, use additional 10ul.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 25 \u00b5l of digestion buffer to the tube. Incubate sample at 37\u00baC for four hrs or at 30 \u00baC overnight with shaking.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Extraction of peptides_\r\n\n\n\u2022 Remove digestion mixture and place in a clean tube\r\n\n\n\u2022 To further extract peptides, add 10 \u00b5l of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid or 1% formic acid solution to gel pieces and incubate for 5 minutes. Remove extraction solution and add to digestion mixture. This step also serves to inactivate trypsin.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Centrifuge to remove any gel particles to prevent clogging or damage of columns. Transfer to a fresh eppendorf and store at 4\u00baC."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Glutathione-S-transferase \\(GST) tagged proteins have variety of applications including purification of fusion proteins. The GST pull-down assay is an _in vitro_ method used to determine a physical interaction between a GST tagged probe protein to an unknown or a known target protein. The procedure involves incubation of the GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads with the total cell lysate. Complexes eluted from the beads are resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver/comassie staining. The protein bands are subjected to in gel trypsin digestion followed by MALDI \\(Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) or LC-MS/MS \\(Liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry) analysis of resulting peptides to identify the interacting proteins.",
