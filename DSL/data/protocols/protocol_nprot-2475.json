The hazard ratio \\(ACR versus placebo) for 2 years or more after curative therapy was 0.27 \\(95% CI: 0.07-0.96) <3>. However, ACR failed to suppress recurrence within 1-2 years following curative therapy <3>. The hazard ratio \\(ACR versus placebo) for within 1 year of curative therapy was 0.72 \\(95% CI: 0.45-1.17) <3>.

Therefore, a therapeutic method to reprogram and destroy human solid tumor cells with chemicals alone has been developed. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nClinical case; Direct reprogramming therapy in a patient with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with sorafenib resistance:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n A 34-year-old woman who had advanced hepatocellular carcinoma \\(HCC) beyond Milan criteria and had experienced the recurrence of HCC in 12 months after liver transplantation was treated with sorafenib for 6 weeks at a dose of 400 mg twice daily. Diarrhea, weight loss and hand-foot skin reaction as adverse reactions during sorafenib treatment were reported. However, she was turned out to be a non-responder of sorafenib \\(Figure 4A). Furthermore, she was hepatitis C virus \\(HCV) infection-positive patient even after sorafenib treatment. The viral load was 6.20 \u00b1 0.73 \\(log 10 HCV RNA, mean \u00b1 SD) in the patient. Then, alanine aminotransferase \\(ALT) level was 58.4 \u00b121.8 U/L \\(mean \u00b1 SD), and aspartate transaminase \\(AST) level was 90.1 \u00b1 30.5 U/L \\(mean \u00b1 SD) in the patient \\(normal range for each level in ALT and AST, 0-50 U/L). \r\n\n\n  Therefore, in vitro anticancer drug sensitivity testing was performed using the patient's HCC that had expressed aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 \\(AKR1B10) and retinoid X receptors. Since her cancer cells were eliminated by acyclic retinoid \\(ACR) plus zopolrestat as an AKR1B10 inhibitor 6 days later, she was treated with ACR \\(600 mg per day) plus zopolrestat \\(1200 mg per day) for 48 weeks. Then, her HCC disappeared in 3 months of ACR plus zopolrestat therapy \\(Figure 4B) and serum alpha-fetoprotein \\[AFP] and des-\u03b3-carboxyprothrombin \\[DCP]) levels were normalized \\(Figure 4C). Furthermore, ALT and AST levels were improved \\(mean \u00b1 SD: 39.3 \u00b1 20.5 U/L in ALT level, 46.5 \u00b1 20.3 U/L in AST level; normal range for each level in ALT and AST, 0-50 U/L), and the viral load for HCV decreased \\(mean \u00b1 SD: 3.00 \u00b1 0.30, log 10 HCV RNA) in the patient after ACR plus zopolrestat therapy compared with after sorafenib treatment. Moreover, she survives 36 months in the recurrence-free of HCC after ACR plus zopolrestat therapy. Only headache was observed as an adverse reaction during ACR plus zopolrestat therapy.\r\n\n\n Patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC within Milan criteria \\(single tumor \u22645 cm in size or \u22643 tumors each \u22643 cm in size, and no macrovascular invasion) have an excellent outcome \\(1) \\(2). Even after liver transplantation, however, the recurrence rate is higher and the prognosis is worse in patients with advanced HCC beyond Milan criteria \\(1) \\(2), and the recurrence-free survival rates are 0.0 % at 18 months in those patients \\(3). Though sorafenib is the only drug showing survival benefits in advanced HCC patients \\(4), the patient showed sorafenib resistance. Therefore, she was treated with ACR plus zopolrestat therapy, and could get successful outcome. Considering our results of in vitro anticancer drug sensitivity testing, her HCC cells with sorafenib resistance were appeared to be directly reprogrammed to approximately normal hepatocytes and ACR plus zopolrestat induced apoptosis in 3 months. Therefore, we could get a proof of concept for the direct reprogramming therapy method of human solid tumor cells in the current study. \r\n\n\n Furthermore, she is HCV infection-positive. However, by the direct reprogramming therapy, the viral load of HCV decreased. Considering the viral load reduction of HCV under all-trans retinoic and monotherapy was observed \\(5), the phenomenon observed in our study may be the effect of ACR.\r\n\n\n  In conclusion, ACR plus zopolrestat therapy as the direct reprogramming therapy would warrant testing in the patients with advanced HCC that express AKR1B10 and retinoid X receptors, even if they have sorafenib resistance. Furthermore, we could discover the novel therapeutic method through the process for generation of human induced pluripotent stem \\(iPS) cells from human liver cancer cells \\(6) and come true the clinical application."
