            "content": "Whole mount _in situ_ hybridization is a highly developed and common technique to reveal localizations of target mRNA in embryos <sup>1)</sup> . Although it can roughly tell us localization of mRNA in tissue levels, sometimes we need more precise information for its localization, especially inside one cell of tissues. Recently, many researchers are trying to stain mRNA with fluorescent reagents with whole embryos because fluorescence have higher resolutions than chromogenic substrate and it would tell us localizations of mRNA in 1 cell level. Some reports that used fluorescence methods gave us beautiful images and suggest important conclusions from localization patterns of mRNA inside cells. However, Whole mount fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization is sometimes very difficult for researchers, because they have to modify the protocol for each species and each embryonic stages, if they want to take a beautiful image that have high S/N ratio. In this protocol, we describe how to perform fluorescent _in situ_ hybridization in a mouse embryo. This protocol is originally based on Zebrafish fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization method <sup>2)</sup> , but a probe label is different from original one to achieve clearer image<sup>3)</sup>. This protocol includes tips that reduce fluorescent background and you can adopt this method to Zebrafish and other animals also."
