            "content": "<p>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is solid oral prescription tablets formulations that have been used for medication of malaria and a wide variety of inflammatory conditions. Moreover, HCQ has in-vitro activity for the treatment of&nbsp;SARS CoV-2,&nbsp;and related coronaviruses problems [1-3].In recent days it is proven to have superficial ability and tolerable safety against COVID-19 (coronavirus-2019) related pneumonia in clinical experiments performed in China [4]. The COVID-19 (corona virus) 2019, appeared in middle of December 2019, has proliferated swiftly, now confirmed in numerous countries across the globe. As of March 01, 2020, the COVID-19 has produced 860,076 infections and 42297 deaths in all countries majorly USA, Italy, Spain, &nbsp;China and other countries across the globe etc., &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>After conducting the multiple clinical trails by the State Council of China, confirmed that chloroquine phosphate, a long-standing medicine used for treatment of malaria, had proved noticeable efficacy and satisfactory safety in treating COVID-19 (Corona virus 2019) related pneumonia patients. Serious unfavorable reactions to HCQ and chloroquine phosphate were not observed in the COVID-19 patients. Based on these conclusions, a conference was organized on 15, February 2020; members including professionals and experts from government and regulatory authorities of clinical trials agreed and approved that HCQ and chloroquine phosphate has effective against COVID-19. Based upon limited available clinical trials data, HCQ is recommending for treatment of COVID-19 infected patients in most of the countries. Due to wider accessibility of these HCQ tablets in the United States, it has been administered to hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is still under investigation clinical trials for treatment of patients with different stages like mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. The chemical structure of HCQ was shown in Fig. 1.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, most of the countries were looking for HCQ drug product literature and other related information for better understanding, due to the COVID 19 pandemic. It is very important to know the drug product release with respective the time in invitro conditions. The literature survey revealed different types of analytical techniques are used for determination of HCQ to report the information, such as HPLC with PDA detector [5-6], HPLC with UV detector [7-11], chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [12-13], LC/IT/MS [14], capillary-LC [15], Electrochemical study [16]. </p><p><br></p><p>Majority of the literature was reported in pharmacokinetics of HCQ in biological fluids. &nbsp;Only one method in the USP monograph was reported with UV-Spectro photometric method for estimation of HCQ tablets in vitro dissolution profile. Generally, UV methods results are not reliable &nbsp;due to reproducibility problem. Other than USP method there was no literature on the HCQ tablets invitro dissolution profile in different multimedia to understand the product behavior. The RP-HPLC is powerful and simple technique for quantification drug products in different pH conditions. Moreover, in the regulated pharmaceutical industry, the drug products released into the global market after determination of quality safety and efficacy. Hence, HPLC methods are required with suitable precision, accuracy and sensitivity level. The main aim of present work is to develop a simple and reproducible HPLC method for estimation of HCQ dissolution profile (0.1N HCl, 0.01N HCl, pH 4.5 sodium acetate, pH 6.8 phosphate buffer).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

Based on the recent clinical experiments it is exploiting for the treatment of COVID-19, corona virus across the globe.&nbsp;A Reverse phase RP-HPLC method have been developed and validated as per the current ICH guidelines for estimation of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. As part of method validation specificity, linearity, precision and recovery parameters were verified. The concentration and area relationships were linear (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.999), over the concentration range of 25 to 300 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> for HCQ. The relative standard deviations for precision and intermediate precision were less than 1.5%. The proposed RP-HPLC generic method was applied successfully for evaluation of invitro dissolution profile with different pH conditions like 0.1N HCl, pH 4.5 Acetate buffer and pH 6.8 Phosphate buffers of US marketed reference product.</p>",
