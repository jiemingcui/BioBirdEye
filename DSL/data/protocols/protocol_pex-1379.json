            "content": "Thawing Cells\nDAY 1\n:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If not already prepared, make BEGM by thawing growth supplements and adding to the basal medium and sterile filter (0.22 um pore).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Generally, one vial of cryopreserved cells is thawed into one T75 flask.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 18 mL of growth medium to the flask and pre-equilibrate in the incubator for approximately 30 minutes.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To thaw cells, place the vial(s) in a 37 \u00b0C water bath.\u00a0Swirl frequently to check if the contents have thawed.\u00a0It usually takes less than three minutes.\u00a0Upon thawing, spray the vial with 70% ethanol to reduce surface contaminants.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using aseptic technique, pipet the vial contents up and down to resuspend the cells.\u00a0Add cells to the pre-equilibrated T75 flask.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, instead of adding thawed cells directly to the flask, you can add the cells to a tube of pre-equilibrated medium, centrifuge cells at 1000 RPM for five minutes, resuspend the pellet in fresh medium then add to the flask.\u00a0This removes the DMSO in which the cells were cryopreserved. Place flasks in a CO\n2\nincubator (5% CO\n2\n, 37\no\nC).\nOPTIONAL : Check cell viability by adding trypan blue to some cells on a microscope slide.\u00a0About 50% or more of the cells should exclude the dye.\nDAY 2\n:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Check cultures under the microscope to determine if cells have attached to the plastic.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any floating cells did not survive the freeze/thaw process.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the media and replace with 15 mL of fresh BEGM.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This will remove the dead cells and any left-over DMSO if cells were added directly to the flask without a prior rinse.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place flasks back into the incubator.\nDAY 4 and LATER\n:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate media and replace with 18 mL of BEGM.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Replace media every two days.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When cells reach approximately 80-100% confluence, passage cells into more T75 flasks.\nPassage Protocol:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate off media.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 4 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution (room temperature) to each T75 flask.\u00a0Incubate at 37\no\nC for 2-3 minutes.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When approximately 80-90% of the cells are detached (which can be facilitated by tapping sides and bottom of the flask), add a half volume of SBTI to the flask, pipet up the trypsin/SBTI mixture, and rinse the flask bottom.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This aids mixing of the trypsin and SBTI, and helps remove some of the still adherent cells.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer the cells to a sterile centrifuge tube.\u00a0Cells from individual flasks can be combined.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge cells at 1000 RPM for five minutes at room temperature.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate off the supernatant.\u00a0Agitate the pellet by tapping to break up the pellet.\u00a0Add 10 mL BEGM, and vigorously and quickly pipet the cells to create a homogeneous suspension.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer a 10 \u03bcL aliquot to a hemocytometer and count the cells.\u00a0A confluent T75 flask typically has 2-4 million cells.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 5 x 10\n5\ncells/T75 flask.\u00a0Final volume of BEGM should be 18ml/flask.\ni.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OPTIONAL: Additionally, some cells can be set aside for cryopreservation at this point. (See below).\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culture cells as above, changing the media every two days until cells reach confluence.\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When flasks reach confluence: 1) cryopreserve the cells, 2) transfer to Transwells or other plastic ware for studies, and/or 3) further passage cells.\nc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After cells have been removed by trypsin, the trypsin neutralized with SBTI, and cells are counted, adjust cell density to the desired one by either adding more media and/or centrifuging and re-suspending in less media.\u00a0Usually we adjust the density to 10\n6\ncells/ml.\nFor Transwells\n:\nDetermine the number of inserts to be seeded and adjust cell density and volume as outlined in the table below:\nSuggested Cell Seeding Densities/Volumes are given in Table 1\nExample:\u00a0seed twelve 24 mm inserts at 300,000 cells per insert.\u00a0Include a fudge factor so you do not run out of cells.\u00a0In this case, calculate as if you were seeding 14 inserts.\nFourteen x .75 mL = 10.5 mL final volume.\u00a0Fourteen x 300,000 cells = 4.2 million cells.\nIf your cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 million/ml, you would add 4.2 mL of the cell suspension to 6.3 mL of additional medium to get the desired plating density. (300,000 cells/0.75 mL added to each insert).\nLet cells adhere for 16-24 hours. After the adhesion period, aspirate off nonadherent cells, and then add fresh medium apically.\u00a0Once the cells reach confluence, apical medium is removed and cells are fed basolaterally every other 48 hours, until used.\nFor Plasticware:\nLonza suggests seeding cells at 1 x 10\n5\n/cm\n2\nin 1 mL BEGM/5cm\n2\ngrowth area.\u00a0Cells should be used at 90-100% confluence for experiments.\u00a0As cells near confluence, cells may need to be fed daily as they quickly deplete the nutrients in the medium.\nSuggested Cell Seeding Densities/Volumes are given in Table 2\npHBEC CRYOPERSERVATION:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cells can be frozen using standard techniques.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trypsinize the cells as usual.\u00a0Determine the number of cells present and repellet.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend the pellet in Cell Freezing Medium (10\n6\ncells/1.5-2.0 mL) and pipet up and down to mix.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer to cryovials and let sit on ice for 20 minutes.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add vial in upright position to a Styrofoam rack.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place cooler in a -80\no\nC freezer for 16-24 hours.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place vial in liquid N\n2\n.\nNotes:\npHBEC cells generally can be passaged 3-4 times before they stop proliferating.\npHBEC cells received from Lonza have been passaged once previously.\nAlternatively, if buying cells commercially, you can get cells already plated in a flask; this would bypass thawing of the cells.\nQuality Control\nCells should be observed microscopically to insure there is no bacterial or fungal contamination.\u00a0Cells that fail to thrive (do not reach confluence) should not be used for further passaging or experimental procedures.\u00a0Also, cells that show unusual morphology should also be considered carefully before proceeding further.\u00a0Generally poor growth of the cells is associated with aging of the cells.\u00a0If all culture conditions have been checked (CO\n2\nconcentration, humidity levels, incubator temperature, etc.), it is likely that the poor growth is characteristic of the cells themselves.\u00a0Cells are maintained in a water-jacketed CO\n2\nincubator; the concentration of CO\n2\nshould be checked periodically (at least once per week) using a Fyrite test kit.\u00a0The temperature within the chambers should also be monitored with a thermometer.\u00a0Incubators are periodically (at least every two weeks) cleaned with anti-bacterial/antifungal agents.\u00a0An antifungal agent (benzalkonium chloride) is added to the internal water trays to deter growth of contaminants."
