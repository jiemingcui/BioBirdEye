It is a powerful tool applied to various fields of research including battery optimization<sup>1</sup>, heat transfer<sup>2</sup>, pipe and valve design<sup>3,4</sup>, electronic cooling<sup>5</sup>, meso-scale air pollution models<sup>6</sup>, food industry<sup>7</sup>, and biology<sup>8</sup>. Recently, CFD has been applied to simulate blood flow in microfluidic channels with embedded obstacles<sup>9</sup>. It represents the first step in revealing the hemodynamic profile within disturbed blood flow and allows it to be correlated with the results of real blood experiments, potentially revealing important information about the thrombotic response. In 2021, Zhao and Vatankhah et al. commenced work in this field, simulating blood flow within a stenotic microfluid device using ANSYS Fluent to investigate the effect of stenosis geometrical properties on blood flow<sup>10</sup>.</p><p>As commercially available CFD packages like ANSYS Fluent become increasingly accessible, hemodynamic researchers could benefit from applying them to their studies. However, such software can also generate coarse or even unrealistic results with inappropriate settings. To this end, this protocol aims to 1) help readers to replicate the studies completed in the paper by Zhao and Vatankhah et al; 2) aid the potential readers in better understanding of the results of CFD studies and 3) improve their CFD verification and validation skills.</p>"

            "content": "Any version of ANSYS with the Fluent package included will suffice to carry out the following procedure. However, it is important to note that the following steps are specific to ANSYS 2020 R1.\nIn this research of stenosis microfluidic channels, the contractions were extensively investigated with particular focus on the shear rates and shear rate gradients present throughout the channel. This protocol will focus on replicating Figure 2A-D from the Zhao and Vatankhah et al paper\n10\n(Fig. 1).\nEstablishing Geometry\nTo start with, open ANSYS workbench and drag the Fluent flow (FLUENT) module into the project window. The geometry setup would appear on the first row. Right click the Geometry tab and select Design Modeler. It is recommended to select \u201cmicrometer\u201d as the default unit from unit tab before drawing the structure. Note the units cannot be altered after drawing commences. Pick the desired work plane and create a new sketch on it. The initial drawing should be completed in two dimensions (Fig. 2). The different channels utilized in the Zhao and Vatankhah et al paper\n10\ncan be modelled accordingly. Note that the fillet radius R5 is 5 \u00b5m in all cases. After completing the two-dimensional drawing, click Extrude to generate the three-dimensional concentric or eccentric stenosis model microfluidic channel.\nApplying Mesh\nIn this step, the size and method of meshing are altered using the left-hand panel. To obtain the most accurate results, it is suggested to generate a relatively fine mesh that can still be constructed in a reasonable amount of time, this will vary based on the users\u2019 PC specifications. An unnecessarily dense mesh will waste computational resources and prolong the calculation time. To this end, a delicate balance should be struck between the fineness and computational power usage. Notably, the region of interest shall be further refined, together with the complex areas where the flows would not simply be straight. In bulk regions with consistent flow, the coarse mesh can be used to save computational power.\nFor instance, the stenosis model appearing in Zhao and Vatankhah et al paper\n10\nis generated by employing a general mesh size of 1.5 microns initially for the entire geometry using the hexahedral method. This general grid sizing is then refined and reduced in regions of increased flow complexity as demonstrated by the finer grid size on the curved faces of the model (Fig. 3). This finer sizing can be achieved by adding extra mesh size modules on faces or edges. For the stenosis channel, a \u201cface sizing\u201d module is applied on the stenosis area to reduce the mesh size to 0.4 microns. Using a 32 threads computer, this simulation had a computation time of 180 minutes. Once the mesh has been established, update the generated model to the ANSYS workbench before exiting the meshing software.\nAdjusting Setup and Running Solution\nPrior to entering the next step, it is important to ensure that double precision is being employed and that the correct number of solver processes for the CPU are being used. These can be modified by right clicking on setup and choosing \u201cedit\u201d.\nDouble click the \u201csetting\u201d tab in ANSYS workbench to open Fluent. Set the flow to be laminar from the left \u201cModels\u201d panel. Note in most microfluidic channels, the flow can safely be assumed to be laminar because of the low Reynolds number of the flow. Set the correct fluid medium by entering its density and viscosity. Note that common fluid, such as water, can be chosen from the ANSYS database directly. Table 2 of the main paper presents the density and viscosity values appropriate for each fluid. Having created the correct material the fluid in \u201cCell zone conditions\u201d is set to be the material of the model (blood or water).\nBoundary conditions should be defined on the previously named selections. For instance, the main paper defined mass flow rate at the outlet, which should be calculated using the equations in the main paper and entered into ANSYS outlet boundary condition. A zero-pressure inlet should be selected in this scenario. Conversely, when suing a \u201cvelocity inlet\u201d or \u201cmass flow inlet\u201d, the outlet should be set as a zero-pressure. As such, if error messages appear when attempting to run the simulation, it is advisable to first check the boundary condition settings.\nThe residuals under the \u201cmonitors\u201d tab should all be set to a convergence criterion of 1e-6 (Fig. 4A) before initializing the solution using the Hybrid Initialization method (Fig. 4B). In the \u201ccalculation\u201d tab, the iteration steps should be set as a large number e.g., 5,000, to ensure that the simulation has sufficient opportunity to converge (Fig. 4C). Select the parameters of interest from \u201cdata file quantities\u201d under the \u201ccalculation\u201d tab. For the purposes of the Zhao and Vatankhah et al paper\n10\n, the strain rate was added (Fig. 4D). The simulation will automatically stop running when the solution converges, and all residuals are below the value of 1e-6. Another calculation is optional if the convergence criteria are not achieved after the first set of iterations are complete. The user should know whether their solution is likely to successfully converge after the first few hundred iterations as the graph of the residuals should display a decreasing trend (Fig. 5). In most cases, a smooth convergence of residuals indicates the simulation settings are properly implemented.\nAttaining Results\nDouble click \u201cResults\u201d in ANSYS workbench to open CFD-Post. The top menu provides options to add contour plots, streamlines & volume renderings. The detailed settings for generating Figure 1 are described below.\nThe WSS contour on the walls can be plotted by clicking the \u201cInsert\u201d tab. In the pop up window, choose \u201cwall shear stress\u201d as the variable and \u201cwall\u201d as the location (Fig. 1A). To find a streamline passing through a certain point, define the point first by clicking on \u201cLocation\u201d in the top menu bar and selecting \u201cpoints\u201d. Enter the location values\nx\n= 0,\ny\n= 80,\nz\n= 30. Then go to \u201cInsert\u201d > \u201cstreamline\u201d and select the previous defined point as the starting location. Select the direction of the streamlines as \u201cForward and Backward\u201d. In the color tab, select strain rate as the variable to be plotted by the color of the streamline (Fig. 1B).\nTo export data, click on the top menu and go to \u201cFile\u201d > \u201cExport\u201d. Choose the previous streamline as the location, strain rate as the first variable and WSS as the second variable. Save the exported data to the desired location and plot them using other software (Fig 1C and D). It is worth noting that the strain rate gradient needs to be created by the user. First create an expression which calculates the dot product of the velocity and strain rate gradient vectors. For instance, \u201cdot = (Strain Rate.Gradient X*Velocity u+Strain Rate.Gradient Y*Velocity v+Strain Rate.Gradient Z*Velocity w)\u201d. Then divide the dot product by the velocity magnitude, such as \u201cdot/Velocity\u201d. Create a variable which has the value of the expression just created above and export data as aforementioned (Fig. 1D)."

To ensure that the results obtained from the CFD analysis are independent to the applied convergence criteria, at least three simulations should be performed with different convergence criteria to confirm that the results are not dependent on the imposed convergence criteria. There is no certain rule to pre-assume the threshold. However, the convergence criteria that ensures the solution does not vary from the point required for laminar flow simulations within microfluidic devices is typically between 10<sup>-6 </sup>and 10<sup>-7</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grid sensitivity analysis</strong></p><p>In CFD analysis, the domain of interest should be discretized into computational cells. Within each cell, the conservation laws of physics should be satisfied, where the mass of flow shall be conserved, and the rate of change of momentum should match the sum of forces applied to the cell<sup>12</sup>. Therefore, the final solution would depend on the grid applied to the computational domain. Three simulations with three different grids should be carried out to indicate that the solution is not dependent to the selected grid. Note that the number of elements for each grid shall be significantly differentiable. For instance, the main paper increases 100% of element from medium and fine meshing grid. Importantly, the error between each grid should be less than 5%. At last, it is recommended that the convergence criteria analysis would be performed on the finest grid; a rule of thumb, the finest grid usually needs more iterations to converge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Validation analysis</strong></p><p>The CFD results shall be compared with available resources, e.g., analytical, computational, or experimental studies.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Thrombosis is both attributed to biochemical agonists and mechanical stresses applied to platelets. Whilst the effect of biochemical agonists has been extensively studied, the mechanosensitive factors remain poorly defined. Stenotic microfluidic channels mimic the narrowing vessels, providing the real-time observation of platelets under disturbed flow. Though the experimental analysis of platelets in disturbed flow confirms the mechanosensitive behavior of platelets, it cannot explicate detailed thresholds for platelet activation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) could be utilized alongside experimental analysis to characterize thresholds for platelet behavior under imposed shear stress. CFD simulations, however, are prone to uncertainties and errors which should be minimized to obtain compelling results. Hereby, we have presented a CFD protocol for researchers in the field of microfluidic and hemodynamic studies.</p>",
