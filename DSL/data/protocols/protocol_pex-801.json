            "content": "<p>The localization and translation of mRNAs are regulated by complex and heterogeneous mechanisms in living systems. These mechanisms are believed to be tightly coupled to produce the finely tuned levels of protein synthesis required for cellular asymmetric structures and functions. To date, extensive effort has been invested in designing real-time visualization techniques to understand the dynamics of mRNA localization and translation at the single-molecule level. Although the many emerged techniques have revealed strong correlations between the spatiotemporal regulation of translation and specific cellular functions, their causalities have largely remained out of reach, due to a dearth of techniques for directly controlling specific mRNAs. Translation inhibitors and nucleotide-based strategies are used widely to manipulate mRNA localization and translation, but these techniques suffer from low spatial resolution and poor reversibility. Chemical compounds do not provide any specificity, and oligonucleotides typically require long lag times for their effects to manifest. Optogenetic approaches would be an ideal means to address these drawbacks. A variety of optogenetic methods exploiting photoreceptors from plants and bacteria have been developed to modulate a wide range of transcription and post-translational signaling, but little efforts have been made to control translation.&nbsp;Here, we present an optogenetic approach for robust and reversible inhibition of specific mRNAs in live cells.&nbsp;</p>"

The condition  for HeLa cell is two electroporation pulses of 980V for 35ms. We suggest to determine the optimal amount of plasmid encoding LARIAT components and MS2 or RCas9 components depends on the target mRNA abundance. We used 1:1 ratio.\n-Plate the transfected cells to 96-well plate in 37\u00b0C with 10% CO2 incubator overnight.\n- On the next day, if RCas9 is used, transfect PAMmer using Lipofectamine\n\u00ae\nRNAiMax at least 6 hours before imaging.\nImaging\n- Move the imaging plate to the microscope in the prewarmed environmental chamber.\n- Set up software to acquire fluorescence images.\n- Photostimuatlion can be performed in single 1s loops with a 488-nm laser at a light power density of  490 \u03bcW mm-2 to generate a cluster."
