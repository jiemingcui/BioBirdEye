            "content": "The ever increasing approach of finding novel natural product inhibitors of ODC enzyme has intrigued the wits of researchers for many years. In the lime light of newer gadgetry of information, we have developed a swift, responsive and lucrative method for measuring the ODC enzyme activity. The method is suitable for regular laboratory purposes and could be helpful for screening of molecules under in vitro drug discovery programme. The assay endowed a colorimetric end point that is non-destructive, indefinitely stable and perceptible to the naked eye. Based on the surveillance that picrylsulfonic acid \\(2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, TNBS) reacts at alkaline pH with amines and the amino groups give colored trinitrophenyl \\(TNP) adducts.1-2, this assay is based on the observation that the TNP adduct of ornithine \\(TNP-Ornithine-TNP) is soluble in water whereas TNP adduct of putrescine \\(TNP-Putrescine-TNP) is soluble in 1-Pentanol and this can be differentially distinguished as upper layer, the structures and the reaction of which are hypothetically depicted in Figure 1. The sensitivity of this assay contrasted favorably with sensitivities of radiometric and HPLC based assays as reported earlier.1\r\n\n\nNaturally occurring polyamines are ubiquitous, diminutive, evolutionarily ancient physiological cations, essential for cell growth, differentiation and proliferation. They play a key role in regulating ion channels/receptors, cell cycle involving internal ribosome entry site active only in mitosis in the human ODC mRNA, stabilizes cellular nucleic acids and/or membranes, activates protein kinases and affecting translation, transcription and chromatin structure.3-8 Being involved in cell motility and cell-cell interactions, the polyamine pathway is of immense interest because increased levels are associated with tumor formation. Hence, it is considered to be a promising target for chemotherapeutic intervention in cancer and parasitic diseases. 9-18\\(Figure 2) The polyamine biosynthesis is tightly regulated by ODC \\(EC 4.1.1.17), an enzyme first discovered in 1968, catalyzing the pyridoxal-5\u2032 phosphate \\(PLP)-dependent decarboxylation of L-ornithine to generate putrescine. This enzyme is highly inducible specific to pH, temperature, time and substrate concentration. Mammalian ODC is a well known mediator of c-Myc-induced apoptosis and is a direct target of c-Myc, thus recognized as a proto-oncogene.19-23 The plant ODC is very similar in sequence to animal ODCs, and its expression is correlated with cell proliferation.24 Since ODC is involved in cell growth and differentiation, it\u2019s constitutive over expression ensures a crucial role in numerous disease and disorders including cancer, autoimmune diseases.25 Account of its vital role in cell proliferation, numerous synthetic and natural products have been reported to inhibit the enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis.25-26 Subject to both positive and negative feedback regulation, ODC activity increases at low concentration of polyamine and vice versa. The regulation appears to be a mixture of post-transcriptional and induction of a unique ODC-specific inhibitor termed antizyme. 27-30 ODC expression regulated by vital factors such as Myc, Jun, Fos, and cAMP explicate the allocation of more than a single polyamine in nature. 31\r\n\n\nA wide array of ODC inhibitors has been toiled out and the best-characterized was \u03b1-difluoromethylornithine \\(DFMO; eflornithine), synthesized by Metcalf et al. \\(1978). Investigated as a possible cancer chemotherapeutic agent, it had limited efficacy in early-phase clinical therapeutic trials. Since then unfortunately no other satisfactory inhibitor of ODC enzyme has been discovered in drug discovery and development program.23-26,32,33 Consequently, the urge to find out new ODC inhibitors is progressively increasing and the use of natural products e.g. phytomolecules is advantageous over synthetic counterparts due to fewer side effects and toxicity. Recently researchers have tried to find ODC inhibitors comparable to DFMO and thus there is a requisite for a simple spectrophotometric assay for easy and fast screening of inhibitors. Earlier, numerous methods have been reported for estimating ODC activity which can be categorized to radioactive and non-radioactive methods34-52\\(Table 1). Radioactive methods are hazardous \\(spurious CO2 release) while non-radioactive methods have many disadvantages involving sophisticated instruments, and cost-effectiveness. Hence, we tried to develop a simple, contemptible method which is not based on CO2 formation \\(which give sometimes false result) but simple solubility factor. We evaluated samples53 to see the interaction of the enzyme with molecules to find out inhibitors of ODC enzyme. Mechanism of inhibition may be non-specific, irreversible, reversible, competitive and/or non-competitive. The assay is an improved, uncomplicated and cost- effective involving petite quantity of chemicals \\(Figure 3). The capacity to verify and validate ODC as candidate biomarkers especially in cancer and parasitic disease is limited and for that reason biomarkers already discovered needs to be validated with simple bioassays. Therefore, in this paper, we have modified the assay to simplify the systematic validation of ODC enzyme activity with thorough testing of hefty sample sets."

For each sample there must be at least two sets of eppendorf tubes one with the enzyme and another without enzyme. The same case applies to control set also.\r\n  2. Add the test sample/standard to each set.\r\n  3. Add 5\u03bcL of enzyme from stock solution to one of the sets. The concentration of enzyme is optimized between 10-100\u03bcg/mL and ample activity is observed at 50\u03bcg/mL. \r\n  4. Add 400\u03bcL of substrate reaction mixture to every eppendorf tubes.\r\n  5. Incubate for 37\u00baC for 30 min.\r\n  6. Terminate the reaction by adding 400\u03bcL of perchloric acid \\(1M) or 400\u03bcL of trichloro acetic acid \\(10%). Precipitation must be done to stop the enzymatic reaction.\r\n  7. Centrifuge at 5000rpm for 5 min at room temperature.\r\n  8. Mix 100\u03bcL of standards \\(Ornithine/Putrescine 0.2-100\u03bcM) and/or terminated reaction mixture with 200\u03bcL of 4N NaOH.  At this moment supernatant should be pipetted very carefully and mixing should be done vigorously \\[Critical Step].\r\n  9. Add 400\u03bcL of 1-pentanol.\r\n  10. Mix vigourously for 1 min with vortex mixer \\[Critical Step].\r\n  11. Centrifuge for 5 min at 2000rpm. Two layers form, bottom hydrophilic and top hydrophobic layer. At this point demarcation line should be clear.\r\n  12. Transfer 200\u03bcL of upper \\(organic) phase to a fresh tube containing 200\u00b5L of sodium borate \\(0.1M, pH 8.0) and mix. \\[Critical Step]: pH of Sodium borate is very crucial, it should be 8.0 and mixing should be done properly.\r\n  13. Add 200\u03bcL of TNBS \\(picryl sulfonic acid, 10mM in 1-pentanol). \\[Critical Step]: Prepare the TNBS dye reagent immediately before use. It is prepare in 1-Pentanol, so thawing of TNBS should be done beforehand as it is kept at -20\u25e6C. After that mix for 1 min on vortex mixer.\r\n  14. Add 400\u03bcL of DMSO and mix for 1 min. DMSO should be added after proper mixing of supernatant and TNBS.\r\n  15. Centrifuge for 5 min at 3000 rpm. \\[Critical Step]: A very fine two layers are observed with top layer contains TNP-Putrescine-TNP, while bottom layer contains TNP-Ornithine-TNP. Sensitivity of the assay depends on the precise pipetting of the upper fine layer. The volume of the layer varies depending on the enzymatic reaction \\(30-100uL).\r\n  16. Take upper layer and read absorbance at 426 nm. \r\n  17. Calculate the percentage of enzyme inhibition using the formula below. For initial screening, we use a threshold of 50% enzyme inhibition as a cut off for compound behaving as ODC inhibitors. However the threshold can be increased or decreased according to inhibitory criteria selected by the investigators. For IC50 determination, plot a concentration responsive graph between compound dose and percent inhibition. IC50 values can be derived using curve fitting methods with statistical analysis.\r\n  Control Difference = Mean OD Control with Enzyme-Mean OD Control without Enzyme\r\n\n\nSample Difference = Mean OD Sample with Enzyme-Mean OD Sample without Enzyme\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPercent Inhibition = Control Difference- Sample Difference X 100\r\n\n\n                                                  Control Difference\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIt is also possible to calculate the amount of product formed by plotting a standard graph of Putrescine and calculating the absorbance of test sample in terms of \u00b5M of Putrescine produced."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "A precise method has been developed for measuring the activity of Ornithine decarboxylase \\(ODC) enzyme, a promising target of cancer and infectious diseases using petite quantity of chemicals. The modified spectrophotometric assay has been used to find inhibitors of ODC enzyme. The methodology is based on the cognizance that enzyme transforms L-ornithine hydrochloride \\(substrate) to yellow colored putrescine \\(product) soluble in pentanol, the absorbance of which was measured spectrophotometrically. The technique described herein was optimized for evaluating efficacy of phytomolecules as ODC attenuator but could also be used for exploration of novel bioactive compounds as chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agents. A reaction concoction was prepared and hydrophobic withdrawal of yellow colored TNP-Putrescine-TNP complex was recorded at 426nm. Advanced validation and understanding of the factors affecting the enzyme activity i.e. substrate concentration, inhibitor concentration, temperature, pH of the reaction medium and incubation time were also investigated.",
