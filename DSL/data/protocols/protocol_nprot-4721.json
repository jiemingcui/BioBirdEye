            "content": "**INTRODUCTION**\r\n\n\nSingle-molecule-based localization microscopy \\(SMLM) has overcome the resolution limit of optic microscopy and allows to resolve structures much smaller than about half the wavelength of light <sup>1</sup>. Among SMLM variants, the most widely used are photo-activated localization microscopy \\(PALM) <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>, \\(direct) stochastic optical reconstruction mMicroscopy \\(STORM and dSTORM) <sup>4</sup> <sup>5</sup>   and ground-state depletion and single-molecule return \\(GDSIM) <sup>6</sup>. These methods rely on photo-activation or photo-switching of fluorophores achieved through light irradiation. dSTORM and GSDIM belong to the stochastic switching and readout type of SMLM techniques and use basic transitions of standard markers, such as commercial dyes, to achieve a resolution of up to 10 nm <sup>6</sup>.\r\n\n\nAs SMLM techniques permit to study the distribution of individual molecules within the cell at high resolution, they are receiving increasing attention in the past years <sup>7</sup> <sup>8</sup>.  For example, SMLM has become a highly used tool for the study of the actin cytoskeleton and actin-related processes in the cell, such as formation of membrane protrusions, cell migration, cytokinesis, endocytosis, vesicle trafficking and organelle homeostasis <sup>9</sup> <sup>12</sup>. \r\n\n\nHowever, increased resolution generates a series of new technical issues that must be addressed and solved in order to obtain faithful and high-quality SMLM images. \r\n\n\nAmong the issues that can influence the outcome of the final SMLM image, appropriate fixation of the structure of interest remains often very challenging and, more than any other step, it determines the outcome of the experiment. \r\n\n\nIn Electron Microscopy \\(EM), it is well known that different fixatives impact on cellular structures differently and that buffers can also dramatically affect fixation. The ideal fixative should preserve cellular structures faithfully, an aspect that becomes absolutely crucial in high-resolution microscopy. \r\n\n\nFor this reason, crosslinking fixatives Crosslinking fixatives like paraformaldehyde \\(PFA) and glutaraldehyde \\(GA) are usually superior to other types of fixatives, such as methanol, ethanol and acids. PFA and GA bind amino groups of proteins preserving their location in the cell. On one hand, PFA does not change the tertiary structure of proteins, whose epitopes remain available for binding by specific antibodies <sup>13</sup> <sup>14</sup>. On the other hand, GA crosslinks proteins more efficiently than PFA, but it introduces free aldehyde groups into the fixed specimen that often alter the tertiary structure of proteins and make epitopes unrecognizable by cognate antibodies. Given that GA has a low permeability, cell permeabilization is required either before or during fixation <sup>14</sup>. Thus, GA fixation may result in the loss of both cytosolic proteins and also those that are weakly bound to their partners. In addition to the fixative type, also concentration, incubation time of fixatives as well as permeabilization methods can considerably influence the final outcome of SMLM.\r\n\n\nOther key elements determining the success of a SRM experiment are dense labeling of the structure of interest and use of fast switching \\(in)organic fluorophores <sup>8</sup> <sup>15</sup> <sup>16</sup>. For the imaging of actin filaments, these two conditions can be readily met by Phalloidin, which binds filamentous actin with a high periodicity and can be labelled with the widely used SMLM fluorophore AlexaFluor-647.\r\n\n\nEven though recent publications <sup>17</sup> <sup>18</sup> claim that PFA fixation cannot be used to study the actin cytoskeleton with SMLM, we have show that PFA fixation can preserve the actin cytoskeleton almost as faithfully as GA. Furthermore, we show that PFA fixation circumvents the drawbacks of GA fixation for SMLM of the actin cytoskeleton and its regulatory proteins. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Outline of the protocol** \r\n\n\nWe have taken advantage of SMLM to study the mechanism of initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles, actin-based protrusions of the plasma membrane mediating the migration of mesenchymal cells <sup>12</sup>. Lamellipodia and ruffles are thin, veil-like cell protrusions composed of branched actin filaments polymerized by the Arp2/3 complex. While lamellipodia adhere to the underlying substrate, ruffles do not and can often be found on the dorsal surface of cells. In this protocol, we provide a detailed step-by-step description of the method that we have optimized to image actin filaments within lamellipodia and ruffles and quantitatively map the position of key actin-regulatory proteins. \r\n\n\nAlthough GA fixation has been successfully employed to study actin by SMLM <sup>11</sup>, we show here that it cannot be used for immune-based detection of all actin-regulatory proteins. Conversely, PFA fixation is compatible with multi-color imaging of the actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins.\r\n\n\nWe provide a step -by -step guide \\(**Figure 5**) with duration of all steps that can be easily followed for best results.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Experimental procedure**\r\n\n\nFixation, permeabilization and blocking. This procedure has been optimized for cells growing on glass coverslips and is not affected by gelatin, fibronectin, or collagen coating. For fixation, we use either GA \\(0.3 \u2013 0.5% vol/vol) as previously described <sup>11</sup> <sup>19</sup> or 4% \\(wt/vol) PFA, both dissolved in cytoskeleton protective buffers that preserve the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton. GA fixation works efficiently at room temperature, whereas we established that the optimal temperature for fixation with PFA is 37\u2070C. In both cases, we noticed that fixation time is crucial to ensure optimal antigen-antibody binding and to avoid high background fluorescence. Although many protocols suggest a fixation time ranging between 10 and 20 minutes, in our experience a 10-minute fixation time is optimal to keep the background low and epitope recognition high. \r\n\n\nFixation with crosslinkers requires efficient quenching of all free aldehydes that could bind primary and secondary antibodies non-specifically <sup>20</sup> <sup>21</sup>. For GA-fixed samples, we performed a first step of quenching using 0.1% NaBH4 in Phosphate Buffered Saline \\(PBS) followed by a second one in PBS supplemented with 5% BSA for at least one hour at 37\u2070C or overnight at 4\u2070C. For PFA-fixed samples, we obtained efficient quenching by incubating the specimen directly with PBS supplemented with 5% BSA. Of note, this is a crucial step determining the success of SMLM experiments as, at such high resolution, even single secondary antibodies are detected. As this fact represent a confounding factor in the localization of sparsely distributed proteins, SMLM users should keep in mind that these instructions should be followed very strictly. For example, the lower concentrations of BSA for quenching/blocking that have been proposed in other protocols are of use for confocal microscopy, but they are insufficient for SMLM. In addition, BSA must be freshly prepared on the day of the experiment, given its propensity to form aggregates. \r\n\n\nEM specialists know that GA fixation is best to maintain the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton <sup>19</sup>  \\(**Figure 1**). However, GA fixation can also prevent the detection of specific actin-binding and actin-regulatory proteins, due to conformational changes, and/or epitope hindrance and/or the washout of the protein of interest during permeabilization/fixation. In order to interpret SMLM images properly, it is thus absolutely required to include a few crucial negative controls, such as samples stained with only the secondary antibody \\(**Figure 2**). The qualitative and quantitative comparison between the sample of interest and the negative controls enables the operator to assess the specificity of the signal attributed to actin-binding and actin-regulatory proteins. In the case these samples look alike, the fixation method needs to be optimized or even changed. This troubleshooting procedure may be very long and challenging, especially for non-experienced users. Thus, we have optimized an alternative PFA-based fixation method that minimally perturbs the integrity and architecture of the actin cytoskeleton and is compatible with high-resolution SMLM of both F-actin, actin-binding and actin-regulatory proteins. \r\n\n\nInmunostaining. We employ exclusively primary antibodies that recognize only the cognate protein and no other protein species in Western blotting. Moreover, the working concentration and incubation time of any primary antibody must always be optimized. In the case of secondary antibodies, commercial goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies are widely used in most laboratories. The concentration recommended by suppliers \\(Molecular Probes by Life Technologies, whose antibodies were used in the optimization of this protocol) is usually 1-10 \u00b5g/ml. Yet, given that high labelling density is necessary to faithfully delineate structures at high resolution, we recommend the use of 10 \u00b5g/ml. Incubation times are also crucial as excessive incubation increases the background caused by unspecific labelling. In our hands, optimal incubation time is 45 minutes for most primary antibodies and 30 minutes for the secondary antibodies provided by Molecular Probes, both at room temperature. Importantly, we noticed that AlexaFluor-532-labelled secondary antibodies purchased from Molecular Probes have only minimal lot-to-lot variations and facilitate standardization and reproducibility.\r\n\n\nPhalloidin staining can also be performed at room temperature for 30 minutes. We found that 0.6 U Phalloidin \\(Life Technologies from Molecular Probes) ensures dense labelling of F-actin needed for high-resolution imaging in SMLM. We strongly recommend the use of Phalloidin labelled with AlexaFluor-647, whose blinking properties in oxygen scavenging buffers make it a gold standard fluorophore to obtain the highest resolution in stochastic SMLM <sup>22</sup>.\r\n\n\nSMLM imaging and analysis. We refer prospective users of stochastic SMLM imaging to the work of Van de Linde and colleagues for a detailed description of the imaging procedures <sup>23</sup>.\r\n\n\nIn our protocol, we used a Leica SR-GSD 3D microscope to image fixed cells using an oxygen scavenging system supplemented with the reducing agent Cysteamine hydrochloride \\(MEA) at 100 mM. Depending on the setup, not only the AlexaFluor-532 and AlexaFluor-647 dyes but also many other dyes have been proven to be useful for SMLM <sup>22</sup>  <sup>24</sup>. Extensive efforts have been done in developing image analysis packages for the localization of the centre of blinking fluorophores in SMLM. Although optimization and comparison of analysis packages is beyond the scope of this protocol, we used and recommend freeware imageJ <sup>25</sup> \\(ImageJ; http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) and its plugin Thunderstorm <sup>26</sup>."

As Phalloidin has a finite off-rate, for best results it must be imaged within a few hours of staining.\r\n\n\n\u0394CRITICAL STEP Control samples \\(i.e. the coverslips without primary antibody) can be labelled here only with the secondary antibody to test the effect of the fixation procedure on the labelling of the actin-binding protein.\r\n\n\ni. Prepare a solution in 100 \u00b5l of 5% BSA with 0.6 U of Phalloidin \\(Molecular probes for Life Technologies) and 10 \u00b5g/ml of secondary antibody\r\n\n\nii. Pick the coverslip with forceps and incubate facing down in a drop of 100 \u00b5l of staining solution.\r\n\n\niii. Incubate the sample for 30 minutes at room temperature always protected from light.\r\n\n\n\u0394CRITICAL Longer incubation times will increase the unspecific binding.\r\n\n\niv. Rinse twice with PBS\r\n\n\n10| Check the quality of the staining. Fluorescence of AlexaFluor-532 should be visible in a standard epi-fluorescence microscope. For proteins genetically tagged with a FP, verify that they are still localized where expected and so should the proteins stained with antibodies.\r\n\n\n?TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Sample mounting and super-resolution imaging.** \u2022 TIMING ~1hour\r\n\n\n11| Prepare the imaging buffer \\(10% Glucose, 0.5 mg/ml Glucose Oxidase, 40 \u00b5g/ml Catalase, 100 mM MEA in PBS) by mixing 200 \u00b5l glucose \\(prepared previously at 0.25 g/ml for GLOX buffer), 83 \u00b5l Glucose Oxidase, 50 \u00b5l MEA, 6.75 \u00b5l Catalase and PBS up to 500 \u00b5l. As the concentration of the stock solution of Catalase shows batch-to-batch differences, we add 6.75 \u00b5l of a 1:10 dilution of our concentrated Catalase corresponding to a final concentration of 40 \u00b5g/ml.\r\n\n\n\u0394CRITICAL STEP Imaging buffer must be prepared freshly, Glucose Oxidase freshly prepared, and MEA thawed on the day of imaging. \r\n\n\n\u0394CRITICAL As efficient blinking is crucial for super-resolution imaging, the buffer used must be selected and optimized for each fluorophore. For actin imaging, we recommend the use of AlexaFluor-647 with a Glucose Oxidase-based oxygen-scavenging system.\r\n\n\n\u0394CRITICAL, In order to preserve the integrity of the cells and the actin cytoskeleton, it is crucial to pipet gently and to maintain the sample always wet when changing buffers.\r\n\n\n12| Mount the sample with the forceps on an open imaging ring.\r\n\n\ni. Clean the bottom of the coverslip thoroughly with 70% ethanol. Wipe carefully in the same direction to avoid smudges. Let dry. \r\n\n\nii. Add imaging buffer \\(500 \u00b5l)\r\n\n\niii. Clean the objective with a 50-50 petroleum ether \u2013 butanol solution with a lens paper and always in the same direction. Let dry.\r\n\n\niv. Let the sample holder stabilize for ~5 minutes before imaging.\r\n\n\n13| Image the sample with the microscope. \\(Ref: Leica SR GSD 3D). \r\n\n\n\u0394CRITICAL STEP Super-resolution imaging is not a straightforward task and should be performed preferably by an expert user. Detailed protocols and troubleshooting for imaging procedure are available elsewhere\n23\n.\r\n\n\ni. Select the desired imaging setting, to image close to the basal membrane use the TIRF option, and for actin in the cytoplasm or ruffles choose the EPI fluorescence option.  \r\n\n\n?TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n\n\nii. Select the cell you want to image.\r\n\n\niii. In the super-resolution mode, excite cells with the appropriate laser/filter combination at high laser power in EPI mode to transfer molecules to the dark state. Depending on the fluorophore used and the density of the molecule, the time required to transfer molecules to the dark state will change.\r\n\n\nOnce molecules have been transferred to the dark state, select the appropriate imaging method \\(TIRF or EPI) and image for the necessary time. Depending on the fluorophore used and the labelling density, the time required to obtain an image will change. \r\n\n\n?TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n\n\n14| \\(Optional) Perform data analysis with \\(open source) packages like Thunderstorm 23 to locate the centre of the blinks and create a final SRM image. In some cases, structured background subtraction with a temporal median filter can be beneficial\n28\n.\r\n\n\n\u0394CRITICAL STEP Compare the results of the negative control sample with the samples stained also with primary antibody \\(**Figure 2**). If the pattern is the same, it is possible that the proteins \\(or the epitopes) of interest were lost \\(or masked) during fixation. Alternatively, the primary antibody may not be specific.\r\n\n\n?TROUBLESHOOTING"

By using this protocol and adequate imaging conditions, SMLM user can acquire high-resolution multi-colour images of the actin cytoskeleton and its regulatory proteins. \r\n\n\nAlthough we recommend users to fix cells with GA whenever only the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton is of interest \\(**Figure 1**), this method can be flawed for immuno-based detection of actin-binding and actin-regulatory proteins. Moreover, it can also result in the loss of proteins that interact with F-actin either weakly or in a highly dynamic manner. For such cases, proper PFA fixation as prepared in this protocol can ensure an adequate preservation of both the actin cytoskeleton and its regulatory proteins \\(**Figure 2**). We have employed our protocol to localize Focal Adhesion proteins Paxillin and Vinculin <sup>29</sup> and showed that it gives similar results as compared to the widely used GA fixation protocol \\(**Figure 3**). \r\n\n\nImportantly, we showed that optimize PFA fixation represents an extremely useful alternative whenever GA fixation prevents the epitope-antibody interaction taking as a case study anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody X-22 \\(Thermo Scientific) \\(**Figure 4**). GA fixation has been previously reported to preclude the usage of this antibody in EM <sup>30</sup> and our results show that it results in SMLM images with aberrant clathrin heavy chain localization. Conversely, images obtained from samples prepared with PFA fixation display a normal clathrin heavy chain pattern at the basal membrane of cells.\u2003"

However, optimal sample preparation and imaging conditions for SRM have remained rather anecdotal, making SRM-based imaging of the actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins technically challenging and poorly reproducible.\r\n\n\nHere we describe a protocol for high-resolution SRM imaging of the actin cytoskeleton and actin-binding proteins that preserves the architecture of actin-based protrusions, using as a fixative paraformaldehyde. This procedure is compatible with the analysis of both endogenous and genetically encoded fluorescent proteins thereby expanding the options for antibody labeling. \r\n\n\nThis straightforward protocol allows to obtain artifact-free  super-resolution images of the actin cytoskeleton and actin-binding proteins in only three days.",
