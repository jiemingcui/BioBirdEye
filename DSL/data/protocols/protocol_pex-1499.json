            "content": "<p>\tThe human genome encodes over 1,500 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that play crucial roles in the development or differentiation of somatic cells, germ cells, and early embryonic cells<sup>1-3</sup>. RBPs achieve such regulatory functions by directly interacting with various target RNAs via specific motifs or structural elements<sup>1</sup>. As a well-accepted working rule, RBPs usually regulate gene expressions in a position-dependent manner<sup>4</sup>. For example, the preferable bindings of RBPs at intronic regions usually suggest potential regulations in alternative splicing, while their bindings at 3\u2019UTR tend to participate in regulating mRNA stability or translation<sup>5-7</sup>. As an emerging theme, many RBPs are intimately involved in transcriptional regulation by interacting with promoter and enhancer noncoding RNAs<sup>7-9</sup>. Such position effects and regulatory rules highlight the value of developing transcriptome-wide methods for mapping the precise binding positions of a defined RBP. </p><p>\tMethods currently available for profiling RBP binding landscapes in living cells include CLIP-seq (cross-linking and immunoprecipitation sequencing, also known as HITS-CLIP), iCLIP, and eCLIP<sup>10-13</sup>. These three state-of-the-art approaches use a specific antibody to pull down defined RBP-associated RNA fragments from millions of cells and sequence them unbiasedly. Conceptually different from CLIP-based methods, an elegant technique called TRIBE fuses the catalytic domain of adenosine deaminases ADAR with individual RBP and deduces RBP targets by directly calculating the <em>in vivo</em> RNA editing sites<sup>14</sup>. Though TRIBE can map RBP targets from hundreds of cells, significant challenges arose from the low editing efficiency and duplex bias of the ADARcd domain<sup>15</sup>, which tends to cause frequent A-to-I editing at distal positions far from the bonafide RBP binding sites. Moreover, ectopically expressed RBPs may perturb native RNA interaction networks. Therefore, mapping protein-RNA interactions in fewer cells under native conditions still represents a significant challenge.</p><p>        To address this technical challenge, we have developed a LACE-seq method for unbiased mapping of precise RBP-binding positions in fewer cells or even single oocytes under native conditions. In brief, LACE-seq includes the following steps: (1) cells are cross-linked with UV-C light, and the interested RBP-RNA complexes are immunoprecipitated from cell lysate and fragmented on the beads with micrococcal nuclease; (2) The 3\u2019 ends of fragmented RNAs are dephosphorylated and ligated with a 5\u2019 pre-adenylated linker containing four randomized nucleotides; (3) reverse transcription is performed on beads with a biotinylated primer containing the T7 promoter sequence; (4) the cDNA terminated at intact RBP-RNA cross-linking sites are poly (A) tailed and enriched for PCR amplification and subsequent <em>in vitro</em> transcription; (5) the linearly amplified RNAs are converted into libraries for single-end deep sequencing. Of note, the IVT steps can be omitted if starting with millions of cells. We have recently demonstrated the power of LACE-seq methods in determining the target repertoire and regulatory mechanisms of multiple RBPs in mouse oocytes<sup>16</sup>. </p>"

We highly recommend to use the antibody suitable for immunoprecipitation. </p><p>4.&nbsp;The appropriate concentration of Micrococcal nuclease is critical for LACE-seq library construction. The protein-associated RNA fragments will be too short to be ligated with adaptors if the concentration of MNase is too high. In contrast, the fragment size will be too long to discern the cDNA termination sites if its concentration is too low. The dilution factor titrated in our hand is suitable for low-input cells and single oocytes.</p><p>5.&nbsp;We found that 0.5-100 fmol T7-RT primers are suitable for constructing LACE-seq library started from dozens of cells. Exonuclease I digestion cannot completely remove the T7-RT primer. If an overdose of primer is used, the residual T7-RT primers will be poly(A) tailed and form primer dimers in the constructed library.</p><p>6.&nbsp;The poly (A) tail length should be strictly controlled since a long stretch of A may lead to failure in sequencing. We have systematically tested the reaction time and dATP concentration to ensure the optimal length of the poly (A) tail.</p><p>7.&nbsp;The cycle numbers of barcoding PCR strictly depend on the concentration of transcribed RNA at the IVT step, which typically can produce approximately 120 ng total RNA if start with 1-50 oocytes. Over amplification usually introduce too many PCR duplicates, thus decreasing the library complexity. </p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) directly interact with various RNAs in living cells to regulate their processing, translation, and stability. Identifying the precise binding sites of RBPs is critical for appreciating their physiological or pathological roles in germline and early embryo development. Current methods typically need millions of cells to map RBP binding positions, which prevents us from appreciating the crucial role of RBPs in early development. Here, we present the LACE-seq method for unbiased mapping of RBP-binding sites at single-nucleotide resolution in fewer cells or even single oocytes. LACE-seq depends on RBP-mediated reverse transcription termination, and linear&nbsp;amplification of&nbsp;the cDNA&nbsp;ends for deep sequencing. To further promote its application, we describe a step-by-step protocol about how to construct a successful LACE-seq library.</p>",
