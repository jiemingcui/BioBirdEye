            "content": "A large number of genetic variants have been associated with human diseases. However, the lack of a genetic diversification approach has impeded our ability to interrogate their functions in mammalian cells. Current screening methods are only able to disrupt a gene or alter its expression. Here we describe a protocol that using a dCas9-AID fusion protein together with sgRNAs to induce genetic diversification in situ, allowing high-throughput screening of functional variants in mammalian cells. Guided by sgRNAs, dCas9-AID directly subverts cytidines or guanines to the other three bases independent of AID hotspot motifs, generating a large repertoire of variants at desired loci.\r\n\n\nFollowing TAM-induced mutagenesis, SNVs induced by TAM technology can be efficiently detected by NGS. The procedure involves a two-step of PCR process is used to prepare the DNA library for high-throughput sequencing analysis. which provides versatility as a common set of indexing primers can be paired with many sets of marker gene specific primers. The firstprimary PCR , Amplicon PCR amplifies any part of genome targeted by TAM with a pair of adapter-tailed primers; the 2nd PCR. Adds and index PCRand full adaptors for illumina sequencing. Sample-specific dual indices and flow cell adapters are added in a subsequent indexing reaction \\(Figure 1)1.  PCR amplification of the targeted region generates a library that can be directly sequenced on the Illumina platform \\(Figure 2). Amplicon-based approaches have the advantage of being less expensive, allowing much deeper and more sensitive detection of targeted region by TAM. And importantly, amplicon-based approaches can be applied for the study of SNVs in other cells."

Incubate at 70\u2103 for 10 minutes. If the cells are too few, 4 ul of Linear acrylamide is recommended to be added to each sample.\r\n  4. Add 120 ul absolute ethanol and mix thoroughly by vortexing for 15s at maxi speed. Bring down any liquid drop from inside of lid by brief centrifugation.\r\n  5. Assemble a HiBind\u00ae MicroElute column in a 2 ml collection tube \\(provided).\r\n  6.Transfer the entire solution from Step 4 into the column, including any precipitate that may have formed. Close the lid and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min to bind DNA. Discard the collection tube and flow-through liquid.\r\n\n\n7. Place the column into a new collection tube \\(supplied). Add 500 ul of Buffer HB in the column. Close the lid and centrifuge at 8000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and re-use collection tube.\r\n  8. Place the column into the same 2 ml tube \\(supplied) and wash by pipetting 650 ul of DNAWash Buffer diluted with ethanol. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min. Again, dispose of collection tube and flow-through liquid.\r\n  Note: DNA Wash Buffer Concentrate must be diluted with absolute ethanol before use.

To elute DNA from the column, centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 1 min.\r\n  Note: Incubation at 70oC rather than at room temperature will give a modest increase in DNAyield per elution. Alternatively the second elution may be performed using the first eluate or using the second 10-50\u00ecl of preheated Elution Buffer or water.\r\n\n\n13.
