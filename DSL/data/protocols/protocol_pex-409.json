            "content": "<p>DNA assembly is the cornerstone of genetic engineering<sup>1</sup>. Researchers are currently using various DNA assembly methods to construct plasmid by assembling multiple DNA parts<sup>1</sup>. We reported GT standard (GTS)<sup>2</sup> for plasmid construction under which DNA sequences are defined as two types of standard, reusable parts (fragment and barcode). We developed a barcoding method that can efficiently add any two barcodes to two ends of any fragment without leaving scars in most cases. In brief, the DNA fragments can be standardized by generating two conserved one nucleotide (1-nt) sticky ends (SEs, \u201cC\u201d and \u201cT\u201d) at both ends, which can be ligated (barcoded) with a pair of barcoding oligos with compatible SEs (\u201cG\u201d and \u201cA\u201d). After barcoding, we can assemble up to seven such barcoded fragments through long overlapping sequences (15 to 20 bp) into one plasmid by using one of the existing DNA assembly methods, including CLIVA, Gibson assembly, In-fusion cloning, restriction enzyme (RE)-based methods and Yeast <em>in vivo</em> assembly. GTS provides an open and flexible architecture, allowing users to flexibly define sharable barcode sequence with or without biological functions, and select the appropriate DNA assembly methods based on their preference and the requirements of plasmid construction. To promote researchers to adopt GTS for plasmid construction, a detailed protocol is provided here.&nbsp;</p>"

            "header": "Procedure",
            "content": "Step 1: Design GTS oligos\nThere are two types of oligos under GTS, fragment-associated and barcode-associated oligos. We have developed a Matlab App (Oligo Designer for GT Standard) to design these GTS oligos. The App can be downloaded from the link,\nhttps://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71880-oligo-designer-for-gt-standard\n. This App can be directly installed into Matlab. If user does not have Matalb installed, an exe file can be downloaded from the link,\nhttps://github.com/KangZhouGroupNUS/GTS-Oligo-Designer.exe.git\n.\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Install and run the App. A graphic interface containing two modules for designing fragment- and barcode-associated oligos will appear.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Design fragment-related oligos: Input name and sequence of fragment (>= 35 bp), and click button \u201cClick to design oligos for FRAGMENT\u201d. Remember to include the conversed G and T in the input sequence. If the fragment length is longer than 90 bp, Foligos with or without phosphorothioate (PS)-bonds will be designed and displayed on the right-side of the window. If the fragment length is less than 91 bp, Noligos (Non-modified fragment oligos) will be designed and displayed in addition to Foligos. Users can use button \u201cCopy oligo info\u201d to copy information of the designed oligos to clipboard of the desktop's operating system (so far only Microsoft Windows 10 has been tested), which can be pasted into a spreadsheet of Microsoft Excel. The software arranges the oligo information according to format requirement of the IDT ordering system, and it determines the synthesis scale automatically. Click button \u201cClear results\u201d to reset the software for the next design.\nc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Design barcode-related oligos: Input name and sequence of barcode (20-80 bp), and click button \u201cClick to design oligos for BARCODE\u201d. Two types of Boligos and Aoligos will be designed, and the oligo information will be displayed. The software automatically determines SE sequence. If it cannot find a suitable SE sequence, user can consider to extend the barcode sequence to enlarge the search space. User can manually specify the SE sequence to overwrite the SE search step but it may result in lower assembly efficiency. Boligos designed here can be used with CLIVA, Gibson and In-fusion assembly method. Aoligos designed here are for the CLIVA method. User may manually modify the designed Aoligos for Gibson and In-fusion method: remove the PS modifications and extend SE sequence to meet requirement of those methods. This version of the software does not support RE-based cloning and we will release new version to support them.\nStep 2: Prepare GTS oligos\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All GTS oligos with or without PS bonds (dried form) purchased from oligo manufacturer should be dissolved in nuclease-free water to a final concentration of 100 \u00b5M, and can be stored at -20 \u00b0C for long-term use.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Phosphorylation of Boligos:\nBoligos should have phosphate group at 5\u2019 end and properly folded.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The phosphorylation reaction solution contains 1 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M Boligo, 2 \u00b5L of 10X T4 ligase buffer, 0.5 \u00b5L of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 16.5 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water.\nNote: This step can be skipped if phosphorylated Boligos are ordered directly from oligo manufacturer.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One-step phosphorylation and folding of Boligo are performed using the following condition in a Bio-Rad T100\u2122 Thermal Cycler: 37 \u00b0C for 30 min (phosphorylation), 65 \u00b0C for 20 min (inactivation of T4 kinase), 98 \u00b0C for 2 min (DNA denaturing), 98 to 45 \u00b0C at a rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s, 45 \u00b0C for 2 min, 45 \u00b0C to 4 \u00b0C at rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s (annealing), and hold at 4 \u00b0C.\nNote: The phosphorylation and inactivation in this step can be skipped if phosphorylated Boligos are used.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twenty microliters of the phosphorylated and folded Boligos are diluted using 60 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water, and can be stored at -20 \u00b0C for long-term use.\nStep 3: Prepare GTS fragments\nUser can choose one of the following three options to prepare a GTS fragment.\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Creating fragment using PS-modified Foligos\nFragments can be amplified from various sources (e.g., plasmid, synthetic DNA, genomic DNA) using PS-modified Foligos.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PCR reaction solution contains 1-5 \u00b5L of template DNA (1 to 10 ng/\u00b5L for plasmid and synthetic DNA; 50 to 250 ng/\u00b5L for genomic DNA), 0.3 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M G-Foligo, 0.3 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M A-Foligo, 25 \u00b5L of Q5\u00ae Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, and ultrapure water to top up volume up to 50 \u00b5L.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PCR cycling condition: 98 \u00b0C for 30 s (initial denaturation), 98 \u00b0C for 8 s (denaturation), 55-65 \u00b0C for 15 s (annealing, the temperature is based on melting temperature of primers), 72 \u00b0C for 20-30 s per kb (extension), the steps of denaturation, annealing, and extension are repeated for 35 cycles, 72 \u00b0C for 2 min as a final extension, then hold at 4 \u00b0C.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After PCR, the solution is mixed with 10 \u00b5L of 6X gel loading dye, and loaded into two wells in a 1 % (w/v) agarose gel in Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. Run gel electrophoresis at 150 V for 25-35 min, and image the gel using Gel Doc EZ imager.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cut two slices of gel containing appropriate bands and transfer them into 1.7 mL Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube. If Thermo-Scientific Gel Extraction Kit is used, add 500 \u00b5L of binding buffer to the tube, dissolve the gel completely at 50 \u00b0C, load the solution to the column, wash it using 550 \u00b5L of wash buffer once, dry the column by centrifuging it at at least 10,000 g for 1 min,, and elute the solution using 40 \u00b5L of HPLC water (room temperature).\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Iodine-based cleavage reaction: Mix 40 \u00b5L of purified DNA solution with 5.5 \u00b5L of 1 M Tris solution (pH 9) and 10 \u00b5L of 30 g/L iodine solution, and then incubate it at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer.\n6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The treated solution is diluted with 250 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water and 350 \u00b5L of the DNA extraction binding buffer. Load the well mixed solution to the column, wash it using 550 \u00b5L of wash buffer two times, dry it and elute the solution using 30 \u00b5L of HPLC water (room temperature).\n7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prepared fragment can be stored at -20 \u00b0C for long-term use.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Creating fragment using non-modified Foligos\nFragments can be amplified from various sources (e.g., plasmid, synthetic DNA, genomic DNA) using non-modified Foligos.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The steps of amplification of fragments using non-modified oligos are the same to\nStep 3a 1\nand\n3a 2\n.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The steps of isolation and purification of fragment are the same to\nStep 3a 3\nand\n3a 4\n. At the last step, use 30 \u00b5L of HPLC water to elute DNA fragments from column.\nc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Creating fragment using Noligos\nShort fragments can be directly created by annealing Noligos.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The annealing solution contains 50 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M G-Noligo and 50 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M A-Noligo.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The annealing is done by the following program in a thermo cycler: 98 \u00b0C for 2 min (denaturation), 98 to 75 \u00b0C at rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s, 75 \u00b0C for 2 min, 75 to 45 \u00b0C at rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s, 45 \u00b0C for 2 min, 45 \u00b0C to 4 \u00b0C at rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s (annealing), and hold at 4 \u00b0C.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fragments prepared by annealing Noligos are diluted with nuclease-free water to a final concentration of 10-20 ng/\u00b5L, and can be stored at -20 \u00b0C for long-term use.\nStep 4: Ligate Boligos with GTS fragments\nThe ligation of two Boligos to two ends of a fragment is termed as barcoding. User can choose the following two options to barcode a fragment.\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Barcoding fragment prepared using PS-modified oligos and Noligos\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The barcoding reaction solution contains 3 \u00b5L of prepared fragment (with 1-nt SEs), 0.3 \u00b5L of 1.25 \u03bcM LA-Boligo, 0.3 \u00b5L of 1.25 \u03bcM RG-Boligo, and 3.6 \u00b5L of Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix.\nNote: The recommended minimal fragment concentration is 10 ng/\u00b5L for fragment no longer than 1 kb. If fragment is larger than 1 kb, we recommend to use at least 100 ng/\u00b5L; if fragment is larger than 2 kb, we recommend to use at least 200 ng/\u00b5L. Vacufuge can be used to concentrate fragment solution when the concentration is too low. It is critical to have high purity of fragment with 1-nt SEs, so absorption spectrum (200-300 nm) of each fragment solution should be examined by Nanodrop or a similar device to ensure there is a peak at 260 nm before its fragment concentration can be used in the calculation.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The barcoding reaction is done using the following program in a thermo cycler: 25 \u00b0C for 5 min, and hold at 4 \u00b0C.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Barcoding fragment prepared using non-modified oligos\nA one-pot reaction is performed to generate the fragment with 1-nt SEs using non-modified oligos.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The one-pot RE-digestion and ligation solution contains 1 \u00b5L of Type IIS RE (MboII [R0148S], HphI [R0158S], BmrI [R0600S] and BciVI [R0596S] from NEB), 0.3 \u00b5L of 1.25 \u03bcM L(G/A)-Boligo, 0.3 \u00b5L of 1.25 \u03bcM R(G/A)-Boligo, 3 \u00b5L of fragment obtained in the previous step, and 4.6 \u00b5L of Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix.\nNote: The concentration of fragment is recommended in\nStep 4a\n.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mixture is incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour, 25 \u00b0C for 10 min, and hold at 4 \u00b0C.\nStep 5: Amplify GTS barcoded fragment\nLigation PCR is performed to amplify barcoded fragment from barcoding solution or plasmids constructed under GTS.\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amplify barcoded fragments from barcoding solution\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ligation PCR solution contains 1 \u00b5L of barcoding reaction solution obtained from barcoding step (\nStep 4a 2\nor\nStep 4b 2\n), 0.3 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M RG-Aoligo, 0.3 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M LA-Aoligo, 25 \u00b5L of Q5\u00ae Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, and ultrapure water to top up to 50 \u00b5L.\nNote: If barcoded fragments are assembled using CLIVA method, Aoligos with PS bonds are used in ligation PCR; if the barcoded fragments are assembled using Gibson, In-fusion cloning and RE-based methods, non-modified Aoligos should be used in ligation PCR.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PCR cycling condition is the same to\nStep 3a 2\n.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The isolation of gel containing appropriate bands after gel electrophoresis is the same to\nStep 3a 3\n.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purification of gel containing appropriate bands is the same to\nStep 3a 4\n. In the end, use 40 \u00b5L ultrapure water to elute the column.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amplify barcoded fragment from plasmid solution\nPlasmids constructed under GTS contain barcoded fragments, thus PCR can be performed to amplify them.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PCR solution contains 1 \u00b5L of plasmid solution (1 to 10 ng/\u00b5L, diluted using ultrapure water), 0.3 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M RG-Aoligo, 0.3 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M LA-Aoligo, 25 \u00b5L of Q5\u00ae Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, and ultrapure water to top up the volume up to 50 \u00b5L.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other steps are same to the\nStep 3a 2\nto\nStep 3a 4\n.\nStep 6: Prepare GTS barcoded fragment\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the barcoded fragments are prepared using non-modified Aoligos, 40 \u00b5L of barcoded fragment prepared in\nStep 5a 4\nand\n5b 2\ncan be directly used in DNA assembly step using Gibson or In-fusion cloning method.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If RE-based method is used, a barcoded fragment will be amplified using non-modified Aoligos containing desired RE sites. The barcoded fragment prepared in\nStep 5a 4\nor\n5b 2\nwill be enzymatically treated to generate SEs, and then the treated fragment can be ligated with a plasmid digested using the same REs.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The RE-digestion solution contains 1 \u00b5L of RE1 and 1 \u00b5L of RE2 that recognize two cutting sites on both ends of barcoded fragment, 1 \u00b5g of barcoded fragment, 5 \u00b5L of 10X proper Buffer, and nuclease-free water to 50 \u00b5L.
