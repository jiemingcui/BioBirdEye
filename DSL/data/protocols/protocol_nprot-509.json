            "content": "Suitable matrices to study metastasis and cancer cell growth in the bone microenvironment have been limited to matrices consisting of specific proteins such as collagen or those secreted by immortalised cell lines. Use of the latter is restrictive since these lines retain characteristics representative of a particular stage of differentiation and often do not have the capacity to differentiate further.  Thus, the matrix generated by the immortalised cell secretome will not be representative of the normal bone environment first seen by a tumour cell in the metastatic process. \r\n\n\nWe describe a method to produce and analyse matrices secreted by human primary osteoblasts grown in medium which promotes secretion of a mineralised matrix.  Osteoblasts can be readily and efficiently removed to leave matrices which are free of cells, show a high degree of calcification and contain collagen type I which is representative of the bone matrix _in vivo_.  These matrices are routinely used for culture of two prostate cancer cells lines, PC3 and LNCaP, which are easily harvested for molecular analyses.  This _in vitro_ system offers a more physiologically relevant environment to study the interaction of tumour cells and the bone microenvironment."

            "content": "**Isolation of primary human osteoblasts \\(hOBs)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHuman osteoblast explants are obtained from patients undergoing knee replacement surgery after informed consent according to the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki II declaration and approved by the Human Ethics Committees of the Queensland University of Technology, the Prince Charles Hospital and the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Collect samples under sterile conditions.\r\n  2. Under sterile conditions, harvest non-sclerotic, trabecular bone using a bone curette \\(diameter 5 mm) and transfer to sterile 50 ml tubes \\(Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA). Bone pieces are approximately 5 x 5 mm. \r\n  3. Wash and vortex trabecular bone with PBS for a minimum of 5 times until the PBS remains clear.\r\n  4. Incubate trabecular bone with 10 ml trypsin \\(0.25%)-EDTA for 3 min at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\n2\n.\r\n  5. Add 10 ml growth medium to inactivate trypsin. \r\n  6. Wash samples once with PBS.\r\n  7. Transfer trabecular bone to 175 cm\n2\ntissue culture flasks \\(Nunc, Rochester, NY) and top up with 12 ml of growth medium.\r\n  8. Culture at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\n2\n. \r\n  9. Osteoblast outgrowth can be observed after 5-7 days. Use cells expanded to the second or third passage for experiments. Two 175 cm\n2\nculture flasks at the third passage will give up to 15 x 10\n6\ncells. \r\n   \r\n\n\n**Growth and differentiation of hOBs**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n10. Culture hOBs in growth medium at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\n2\n. \r\n  11. Detach hOBs with trypsin \\(0.25%)-EDTA \\(4-5 ml/ 175 cm\n2\ntissue culture flask).\r\n  12. Add 10 ml growth media to inactivate trypsin. \r\n  13. Transfer cells to a 15 ml disposable plastic tube and centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 min.\r\n  14. Resuspend in 10 ml of growth medium.\r\n  15. Remove aliquot of cells for counting. Generally at about 70% confluence approximately 3-4 x 10\n6\ncells /175 cm\n2\nculture flask are collected. \r\n  16. Plate hOBs at a density of 3000 cells/cm\n2\nin growth media.\r\n  17. Grow hOBs at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\n2\nuntil confluent with media changes every 3-4 days.\r\n  18. When confluent, change medium to differentiation medium.\r\n  19. Culture for 4 weeks to allow secretion of mineralized matrix changing media every 3-4 days. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Osteoblast removal to leave intact decellularized osteoblast matrix \\(OBM)**\r\n\n\nThis method is based on a protocol originally used to generate extracellular matrix coated dishes using corneal endothelial cells \\(1). The following volumes apply to OBM preparations using cells cultured in a 24 well dish.  Volumes can be modified for smaller or larger culture areas accordingly. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n20. Process each 24 well \\(or 6 well) dish separately. Processing of a small number of samples simultaneously allows quick and careful washing of each individual matrix preparation and minimises disruption and detachment of the matrix.\r\n  21. Aspirate culture medium. \r\n  22. Carefully rinse by adding 1 ml sterile dH\n2\nO and then aspirate.  \r\n  \r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: All washes and rinses of the cells on the matrix and particularly the decellularized matrix must be done with extreme care so as not to disrupt or detach the OBM.  We also routinely leave a residual amount of liquid overlying the matrix when using a vacuum aspirator.  Carefully remove the remaining liquid with a standard pipettor using a 1000\u00b5l tip.   \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n23. Add 1 ml of 20 mM ammonium hydroxide to each well.\r\n  24. Incubate at room temperature with occasional gentle agitation. \r\n  25. Check the status of the cultures microscopically at intervals during the lysis to determine the extent of the cellular removal.  Generally this requires between 10 and 12 min for complete lysis of the osteoblasts. \r\n  26. Carefully and quickly rinse OBM twice with approximately 1 ml sterile dH\n2\nO. \r\n  27. Carefully and quickly rinse twice as above with approximately 1 ml PBS.\r\n  28. Place solution over the matrix that is appropriate for the subsequent analyses.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Fixation of the OBM in paraformaldehyde \\(PFA)** \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n29. Carefully aspirate PBS from OBM.\r\n  30. For a 24-well plate, add 1 ml of 4% PFA in PBS.\r\n  31. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min with gentle rocking. \r\n  32.

Culture osteoblasts on round thermanox coverslips \\(Nunc, Rochester, NY) inserted into wells of a 6 or 24 well plate. \r\n  36. Fix samples with glutaraldehyde fixative at 4\u00b0C overnight. Samples can be stored until further processing at 4\u00b0C for up to 4 weeks. CAUTION: Work in the fume hood and wear chemical protective gloves.\r\n  37. Wash 3 times for 10 min in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer in dH\n2\nO, pH 7.4 \r\n  38. Fix in osmium tetroxide solution for 1 h.\r\n  39. Incubate 2 times for 10 min in dH\n2\nO.\r\n  40. Incubate 2 times for 10 min. in 50% ethanol. \r\n  41. Incubate 2 times for 10 min. in 70% ethanol.\r\n  42. Incubate 2 times for 10 min. in 90% ethanol. \r\n  43. Incubate 2 times for 15 min. in 100% ethanol. \r\n  44. Incubate 2 times for 15 min. in 100% amyl acetate. \r\n  45. Critical point dry.\r\n  46. Mount samples on SEM stubs. \r\n  47.

Incubate samples with streptavidin peroxidase for 15 min at room temperature \\(DAKO LSAB+ kit).\r\n  78. Wash samples twice in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min. \r\n  79. Wash samples in PBS for 3 min.\r\n  80. Incubate with DAB solution for 5 min at room temperature.\r\n  81. Wash three times in PBS for 3 min.\r\n  82. Develop.\r\n  83. Rinse gently with distilled water to stop reaction.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Preparation of collagen type I coated plates**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n84. For a 24 well plate, add 1 ml of collagen type I coating buffer per well and incubate at 4\u00b0C overnight.  \r\n  85. Aspirate the collagen type I solution. \r\n  86. Rinse twice with 1 ml PBS.\r\n  87. Add 1 ml of BSA blocking solution.  \r\n  88. Leave at room temperature for 2 h.  \r\n  89. Remove solution and rinse twice with PBS\r\n  90. Add 1 ml PBS.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Growth of PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells on the OBM**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n91. Culture PC3 and LNCaP cells in growth medium to 50-80% confluence.\r\n  92. Aspirate medium.\r\n  93. Wash once with PBS.\r\n  94. Rinse gently with 0.5mM EDTA in PBS \\(5 ml/ 75 cm\n2\nculture flask). \r\n  95. Add 0.5mM EDTA in PBS \\(5 ml/ 75 cm\n2\nculture flask). Trypsin-EDTA is not used for detachment since this strips the cells of membrane receptors and adhesion molecules required for cell signalling and efficient attachment to the substrata.\r\n  96. Return flask to incubator and incubate at 37\u00b0C. \r\n  97. Periodically agitate flask gently.\r\n  98. Periodically monitor cell detachment with a microscope \\(detachment can take up to 40 min).\r\n  99. Centrifuge cells at 370g for 5min to collect cells.\r\n  100.

All manipulations should be performed in low light areas.  All incubations should be covered with an opaque covering such as aluminium foil.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n104. Rinse OBM plus prostate cancer cells 3 times with PBS. \r\n  105. Incubate with FDA staining solution \\(2 \u00b5g/ml) at 37\u00b0C for 15 min in the dark. FDA is a cell-permeant esterase substrate which is hydrolysed by living/viable cells to give green fluorescence. \r\n  106. Rinse 3 times with PBS.\r\n  107. Incubate with PI staining solution \\(20 \u00b5g/ml) at room temperature for 2 min in dark. PI is actively excluded by live cells and thus dead cells in a population are stained red.\r\n  108. Rinse 3 times with PBS.\r\n  109. Add PBS to immerse samples.\r\n  110. Visualise with a fluorescent microscope.\r\n  \r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: Take images immediately because the fluorescein, which is formed by intracellular hydrolysis of FDA, rapidly leaks from cells and samples fade. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Phalloidin and DAPI staining to visualize prostate cancer cell morphology**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: These analyses are light sensitive.  All manipulations should be performed in low light areas.  All incubations should be covered with an opaque covering such as aluminium foil.  Store samples in the dark.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n111. Remove PFA-fixed matrices from 4\u00b0C.\r\n  112. Add 1 ml 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS \\(per well in 24 well plate).\r\n  113. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature with gentle rocking.\r\n  114. Wash twice for 5 min with 1 ml PBS at room temperature while gently rocking.\r\n  115. Add 700 \u00b5l rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin staining solution to each well \\(24 well plate). Phalloidin binds to F-actin. \r\n  116. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking.\r\n  117. Wash twice for 5 min with 1 ml PBS at room temperature while gently rocking.\r\n  118. Add 700 \u00b5l of DAPI staining solution to each well. \r\n  119. Incubate for 40-50 min at room temperature with gentle rocking.\r\n  120. Wash twice for 5 min with 1 ml PBS at room temperature while gently rocking. \r\n  121. Visualise with a fluorescent microscope.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Removal of the prostate cancer cells from the OBM for molecular analysis**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n122. Aspirate medium and wash once with PBS.\r\n  123. Add 0.5 ml of 0.05% trypsin/0.05 mM EDTA per well of a 24 well dish. \r\n  124. Return to incubator and incubate at 37\u00b0C. \r\n  125.

            "content": "**Matrix disrupted or detached.**\r\n\n\nWashing or rinsing of the cells on the matrix or the decellularized matrix was too harsh. There is often variation in the capacity of matrices secreted by osteoblasts from different patients to adhere to plates. Tilt plate and exchange solutions by slowly and carefully pipetting  onto the wall of the well with a standard pipettor using a 1000 &#xB5;l tip. Process a small number of samples at one time.  Alternatively, osteoblasts can be grown and differentiated on thermanox coverslips.  The matrix adheres better to these coverslips.  However, thermanox coverslips exhibit a certain level of autofluorescence under UV light and may not be suitable for all fluorescent staining procedures. Users should determine whether the level of autofluorescence interferes with their particular downstream application. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Cells difficult to visualize or image in 24 well plates.**\r\n\n\nOften visualization of cells in 24 well plates is difficult and can be limited to the centre of the well.  To image larger areas of the wells, remove most of the PBS, leaving about 50 &#xB5;l, and place a 13 mm round coverslip carefully on the remaining liquid.  Coverslips can be floated off the cells by addition of PBS.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Prostate cancer cells are difficult to remove from matrix.**\r\n\n\nPC3 and LNCaP cells are removed from the matrix with trypsin-EDTA.  The concentration of the trypsin-EDTA and the time taken for cell removal should be determined empirically and is dependent on the cell type.  Try higher concentrations of trypsin-EDTA or use other cell detachment solutions. In this regard, we have successfully used collagenase II to remove cells from the matrix. Note that initial attempts to remove the cells with 2 mM EDTA in PBS were unsuccessful even after an hour.  This is presumably because of the high calcium content of the matrix."
