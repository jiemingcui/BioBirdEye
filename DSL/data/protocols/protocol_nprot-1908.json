Rad51 and DMC1 are required to generate joint molecules \\(D-loops). The activities of these proteins are stimulated by either Ca\n2+\nor HOP2/MND1 heterodimer 8-11. Rad54 and BLM proteins are required for dissociation of D-loops through their DNA branch migration activities 9,12. While Ca2+ stimulates D-loop formation by RAD51 or DMC1, it inhibits D-loop dissociation catalyzed by Rad54 or BLM. Therefore, prior to the D-loops disruption step, Ca\n2+\nhas to be depleted from the reaction mixture by adding an equimolar amount of EGTA. The synaptic complex protection assay\n13,14\nare used as an independent approach to confirm the greater resistance of DMC1 nucleoprotein complexes to dissociation by RAD54. In addition, the chemical footprinting with potassium permanganate are used to evaluate the length of DMC1 and RAD51 nucleoproteins complexes and to reveal differences in the structure of these complexes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Design of DNA substrates for the D-loop formation assay**\r\n\n\n1| Use tailed dsDNA that mimics one end of broken chromosome processed by specific exonucleases \\(Fig. 2a in Bugreev et al, 2010) for RAD51 or DMC1 filament formation in the D-loop assay. \r\n\n\n2| Label a 100-mer oligonucleotide #209 \\(Table 1 in Bugreev et al, 2010) using \\[\u03b3-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and then purify it through the Micro-BioSpin 6 column \\(Bio-Rad).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3| Anneal labeled oligonucleotide \\(#209) with a 36-mer oligonucleotide \\(#199) \\(Table 1 in Bugreev et al, 2010) to generate tailed dsDNA substrate. The single-stranded part of tailed dsDNA \\(63 nts) is designed to be complementary to the region of supercoiled \\(sc) pUC19 dsDNA, which represented homologous DNA template. The 3\u2019-end of tailed DNA is expected to invade the scDNA forming D-loop \\(Fig. 2b and 2d in Bugreev et al, 2010). The double-stranded part of tailed DNA \\(36 bp) is designed to be non-complementary to pUC19 DNA.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Design of DNA substrates for the synaptic complex protection assay and chemical footprinting with potassium permanganate.**\r\n\n\nSingle-stranded oligonucleotide \\(# SspI) is designed to be complementary to the region of supercoiled pUC19 dsDNA spanning in the middle unique SspI restriction endonuclease site. This oligonucleotide is incubated with RAD51 or DMC1 to form the nucleoprotein filament. Then, these nucleoprotein filaments is used to form synaptic complexes that protect the plasmid DNA against cleavage with SspI, which site overlaps with the complexes, but not by NdeI, which site lies outside of the synaptic complex \\(Supp. Fig.3a in Bugreev et al, 2010).\r\n\n\n1| Use ssDNA \\(#PP-100), tailed DNA \\(# PP-100/#PP-35L) and ssDNA \\(#PP-0), tailed DNA \\(#PP-0/#PP-35L) \\(Supp Table 1 in Bugreev et al, 2010) to estimate the length and to reveal the structure of the synaptic complexes, respectively, in KMnO4 footprinting.\r\n\n\n2| Label oligonucleotides #PP-100 and #PP-0 using \\[\u03b3-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and then purify them through the Micro-BioSpin 6 column \\(Bio-Rad).\r\n\n\n3| Anneal labeled 100-mer oligonucleotide \\(#PP-100) or 70-mer oligonucleotide \\(#PP-0) with 35-mer oligonucleotide \\(#PP-35L) to generate tailed DNAs.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Preparation of native D-loops in the presence of Ca\n2+\nand their dissociation by RAD54.**\r\n\n\n1| Prepare the initial mixture combining the following ingredients to have their final concentration 25 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM calcium chloride, 2 mM DTT, BSA \\(100 \uf06dg/ml), 20 mM phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase \\(30 units/ml) and 32P-labeled tailed DNA \\(#209*/#199; 30 nM, molecules) in 10 \u00b5l of a total reaction volume.\r\n\n\n2| Add 1 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M DMC1 or 10 \u00b5M RAD51 proteins \\(to final concentration 1 \u00b5M) to the initial mixture \\(8 \u00b5l) to initiate filament formation.

            "content": "The protocol described here was designed to test the stability of D-loops formed by DMC1 and RAD51. Formation of D-loops marks an important bifurcation point in HR; their further processing through either the DSBR or SDSA pathway may lead to either crossovers or non-crossover recombinants. An important question is how the choice between these mechanisms is made. A possible obvious difference is that D-loops destined to being processed by SDSA need to dissociate and those destined for DSBR should be resistant to dissociation. Using the protocol presented here we demonstrated that indeed D-loops formed by human DMC1, but not RAD51, resist disruption by branch migration proteins. This difference in stability may reflect differences in the structure of DMC1 and RAD51 presynaptic filaments. To our knowledge our results are the first to reveal that the recombination intermediates catalyzed by RAD51 and DMC1 are biochemically distinguishable."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "The initial steps of homologous recombination \\(HR) involve processing of the DNA ends by exonucleases to generate 3\u2019-ssDNA tails <sup>1-5</sup>. Then, a protein of the RecA family \\(ubiquitous Rad51 and meiosis-specific Dmc1) binds to this ssDNA and promotes invasion of the DNA ends into the homologous duplex DNA <sup>6,7</sup>. As a result, joint molecules \\(D-loops) are formed. It is currently thought that the joint molecules continue down one of two pathways. D-loops destined to being processed by DSBR \\(double strand break repair) pathway should resist dissociation to generate crossovers, and those destined for SDSA \\(synthesis-dependent strand annealing) pathway need to dissociate producing non-crossovers. The mechanism that channels recombination intermediates into these HR pathways is unknown. We demonstrated that DMC1-generated D-loops are substantially more resistant to dissociation by branch migration proteins RAD54 and Bloom syndrome helicase \\(BLM) than those formed by RAD51. We propose that the intrinsic resistance DMC1-generated recombination intermediates helps to ensure formation of crossing over that is required for the faithfull segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis. Here we describe the protocols for an analysis of D-loop stability using purified human HR proteins.",
