By strictly avoiding touching and compressing the mesentery, especially the blood vessels entering the bowel wall from the mesentery site, the risk of bleeding and severe complications can be minimized.\r\n\n\n*Gastrointestinal \\(GIT) and colonic transit\r\n\n\nGIT Part 1\\(Steps 13-15)*\r\n\n\n**13.** After 22.5 hours inspect the animal and wound closure for signs of infection or other complications.\r\n\n\n**14.** Replace the animals under anesthesia using isoflurane in oxygen and hyperextend its head. \r\n\n\n**15.** Use a forceps to carefully pull out the tongue and feed forward an arterial catheter connected to a 1ml syringe into the mouth and push it forward into the stomach \\(Figure 2).\r\n\n\nThe initial process of marker application for GIT measurement is now finished. Further analysis is described in **steps 19-33**.\r\n\n\n**Colonic transit \\(Steps 16-18)**\r\n\n\n**16.** Carefully check patency of the colon by inserting a polished metal rod 3cm into the colon.\r\n\n\n**17.** Pull out the rod and insert a 2mm glass ball transanally with a blunt surgical forceps and carefully feed it forward for 3cm into the colon with a polished metal rod.\r\n\n\n**18.** Put the animal in a box allowing observation and measurement of the colonic transit time as the time from insertion until excretion of the glass ball.\r\n\n\n**GIT Part 2 \\(Step 19-33)**\r\n\n\nGIT will be analyzed by FITC-dextran distribution along the GI tract 90 minutes after oral administration. This analysis terminates the in vivo experimental part and additionally allows harvesting of any other organs of interest.\r\n\n\n**19.** Replace the animals under deep anesthesia using isoflurane. Maintain anesthesia if any other analysis besides the GIT measurement requires that the animal stays alive \\(i.e. whole body perfusion). Otherwise kill the animal at this time point by cervical dislocation and terminate anesthesia.\r\n\n\n**20.** Reopen the abdomen by using small scissors and straight forceps.\r\n\n\n**21.** Remove the complete GI tract by subdiaphragmal transection of the esophagus and the colon at the most distal position accessible with a small scissor \\(sample any organ or tissue of interest for further studies).\r\n\n\n**22.** Place the GI tract in chilled KHB and inspect it for integrity and the absence of hematomas. \r\n\n\n**23.** Place the GI tract in a Sylgard dish with chilled KHB and transect attaching mesentery arcades using small scissors and straight forceps to completely unfold the organ.\r\n\n\n**24.** Place the intestine onto a foil-covered polystyrene pad and avoid stretching of the intestine.\r\n\n\n**25.** Measure full length of the small bowel and colon separately.Divide the length of the small bowel intestine into 10 equally-sized segments and mark the segments by pinning it onto the polystyrene pad with needles.\r\n\n\n**26.** Proceed in the same manner with the colon but divide it into 3 segments.\r\n\n\n**27.** Transect the intestine at the marked positions and flush the lumen of each segment twice with the same 1ml of KHB into 2ml centrifuge tubes. Flushed intestinal segments can be stored in cold KHB buffer for further analysis.\r\n\n\n**28.** Transect the stomach and cecum longitudinally and put it completely in 2ml tube with 1ml KHB.\r\n\n\n**29.** Vortex all tubes vigorously for at least 10 seconds.\r\n\n\n**30.** Spin down at 1500xg for 5 min and transfer supernatants into new 2ml tubes.\r\n\n\n**31.** Recentrifuge at 11.000xg for 5min and pipette 200\u00b5l duplicates of supernatants into a black 96-well plate.\r\n\n\n**32.** Measure fluorescence with excitation/emission wavelength of 494/521nm and subtract blank values \\(KHB).\r\n\n\n**33.** Calculate geometric center \\(GC) of FITC dextran distribution by the following formula:\r\n\n\nGC = \u2211 \\(% of total fluorescent signal per segment * segment number) / 100."

However, accidental damage to the intestinal blood vessels and mesentery must be strictly avoided.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step 10**: Twisting of the intestine must be strictly avoided to prevent a mechanical obstruction.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step 14**: Length and depth of anesthesia are critical parameters. Animals should not wake up before the following procedures were completed: \\(A) oral administration of the GIT reporter solution by gavage \\(approximately 30sec), \\(B) checking the patency of the colon \\(approximately 20sec) and \\(C) transanally insertion of the colonic transit marker \\(approximately 30sec). Awaking and resedation of the animals during the procedure may have significantly influence colonic transit time. An adequate timing allows the animals to wake up within approximately 30 seconds after glass ball insertion.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step 15**: Catheter application must be performed very carefully. Pull back the catheter and change its position if you feel any resistance during insertion.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step 16**: Proceed with step 16 immediately after gavage of the GIT marker \\(step 15). Do not allow the animal to wake up until the colonic transit marker \\(glass ball) was inserted."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Postoperative ileus \\(POI) is a frequent and severe complication after intestinal surgery <sup>1, 2</sup>. Gastrointestinal dysfunction originates from an inflammatory response within the tunica muscularis induced by the surgical handling of the intestine <sup>3</sup>. Resident macrophages have been shown to play a key role in the initiation of POI <sup>4, 5</sup>. Furthermore, this inflammation can spread from manipulated bowel segments to unmanipulated distant parts of the gastrointestinal \\(GI) tract <sup>6</sup>. Herein we describe the functional assessment of in vivo intestinal motility in a standardized mouse model of POI. This method provides information about the strength of POI and the spreading of the underlying inflammation along the GI tract. Initially, animals are laparotomized and small bowel becomes intestinally manipulated \\(15 min). Ninety minutes before experiment\u00b4s end point, colonic transit is analyzed \\(5-10 min) by the excretion time of a transanally inserted probe. Subsequently, GI transit is measured by means of distribution of an orally administered fluorescent dye along the GI tract over 90 minutes. GI transit analysis requires 30 minutes. Combining both methods in one animal offers the advantage to analyze motility of the complete GI tract, while former studies often focused solely on separated bowel motility or gastric emptying.",
