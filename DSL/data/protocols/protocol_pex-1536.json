With this protocol the FMN concentrations in perfusate samples taken during organ perfusion can be estimated quickly and easily by fluorescence spectrometry. The use of non-binding plates is essential. A fresh standard curve using riboflavin 5'-monophosphate sodium salt hydrate must be prepared every day. To quantitatively compare sample concentrations between different plates, it is advisable to include an internal standard. This internal standard is best prepared by pooling samples from experiments that use the same perfusate composition. This assay will work for samples acquired from whole blood, red cell based solutions or acellular solutions.</p>",
