            "content": "<p>Cancer remains a major and long-term public health challenge worldwide. In 2020, cancer accounted for almost 10 million deaths, making it a leading cause of death in nearly every country of the world. Meanwhile, the cancer burden is continuously growing, which is projected to reach 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% increase from 2020. This calls for unrelenting efforts and resources for cancer prevention, treatment, and disease management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Accurate prognosis for patients with cancer is crucial for the planning of individualized treatment and management, which helps improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality. So far, the tumor-lymph node-metastases (TNM) staging system is the most commonly used to predict the clinical outcome of patients. However, TNM remains inadequate for precise medicine due to considerable heterogeneity in molecular characteristics and clinical behaviors among cancers of the same type and TNM stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, DNA methylation biomarkers hold great promise for improving prognostic accuracy of various cancers. Specifically, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to the C5 position of cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine, which is one of the most common and important epigenetic changes regulating gene expression. DNA methylation plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis, cancer development, and clinical prognosis. The recent development of DNA methylation microarray platforms enables the analysis of methylation across the genome in a high-throughout manner. Thanks to this profiling technique, a series of DNA methylation signatures with prognostic value for different cancers (e.g., lung, breast, liver, colon and rectum) have been reported in recent years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science. It comprises a variety of methods that enable computers to algorithmically learn from data representations and experience, adjust to new inputs, so as to maximize its accuracy of making predictions or classifications. This novel technology has been applied in nearly all walks of life, and there is no exception in molecular cancer research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, there is a growing body of research that uses both genome-wide analysis approach and AI methods to identify DNA methylation patterns for accurate prediction of prognosis among cancer patients. However, thus far no appropriate review has been published to summarize this recent emerging trend. This is especially important given the fact the type of AI-based methods applied in different studies are heterogeneous, and there might exist some powerful but unexploited AI methods. Therefore, we plan to conduct this scoping review to comprehensively map the studies done in this direction, as well as to identify any existing limitation and research gap.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3) Study aims</strong></p><p>Overall, this scoping review aims to summarize how AI methods are being used in genome-wide studies that identify DNA methylation biomarkers for cancer prognosis. The following research questions are formulated:</p><p>(1) What is the most prevalent data processing procedure and AI methods selected?</p><p>(2) What is the characteristics and quality (e.g., source, size) of input dataset?</p><p>(3) How were outcomes evaluated and validated?</p><p>(4) What is the best reported performance for each AI method?</p><p>(5) Is there any study comparing different AI methods using the same dataset? If yes, what is the outcome?</p><p>(6) What is the methodological and reporting quality of existing publications?</p><p>(7) What are the current challenges and limitations of the existing studies, and what are the possible questions that warrant further investigation?</p>"

The final search results will be exported into EndNote, and duplicates will be subsequently removed. The electronic database search will be supplemented by searching web search engines (Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Grey Matters) to identify gray literature. References of relevant reviews and full-text articles will be screened for additional studies.\nThe search strategy will be formulated using both MeSH terms and free-text words related to cancer, AI, epigenetic signatures, and prognosis.

Limitations of the study as reported by the authors\nCritical appraisal of individual sources of evidence\nThe reporting quality of all included studies will be assessed by the Reporting recommendations for tumor marker prognostic studies (REMARK). Besides, if a risk prediction model was developed in a study, its reporting quality will be additionally assessed by\nTransparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD): The TRIPOD statement\n, and its methodological quality will be assessed by\nPROBAST: A Tool to Assess the Risk of Bias and Applicability of Prediction Model Studies.\n\ufeff"

Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a powerful tool that could properly analyze high-dimensional DNA methylation data.

But the methodological strategies used are quite heterogeneous. This scoping review will comprehensively summarize studies conducted in this direction.

We will extract study characteristics, assess methodological quality, and summarize AI methods and pipelines used by included studies.
