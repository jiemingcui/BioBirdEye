            "content": "Purification of human transcription factors in 96-well format\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To prepare the SC-Ura/glucose plates, 1.7 g yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5 g ammonium sulfate, 20 g glucose, 2 g amino acid dropout mixes and 20 g agar were mixed and dissolved into 1 L ddH\n2\nO. Then the medium was autoclaved at 121\u00b0C for 15 minutes.\nPour ~20mL of SC-Ura/glucose agar per 10 cm polystyrene Petri dish.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take out 10 ul of each human ORF expression yeast clone and draw it on the SC-Ura/glucose plates, then put the plates in 30\u00b0C incubator for 48 hours.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each of the yeast clones was transferred to 800 \u00b5L of SC-Ura/glucose liquid medium (1 L medium contains 1.7 g yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5 g ammonium sulfate, 20 g glucose, 2 g amino acid dropout mixes) in deep 96-well plates overnight as primary cultures.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a050 \u00b5L of the above saturated yeast cultures were inoculated into 8 mL of SC-Ura/raffinose liquid medium (1 L medium contains 1.7 g yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5 g ammonium sulfate, 20 g raffinose, 2 g amino acid dropout mixes) in 12 channel plates until the O.D. 600 reached 1.0, following with the induction by adding 2% galactose for 6 hours at 30\u00b0C.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,500 x g for 5 min. Each cell pellet was suspended with 1 ml precool water and transferred to the deep 96-well plates. After centrifuging at 3,500 x g for 10 min and discarding the supernatant, the yeast cell pellets were stored at -80\u00b0C for further study.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take out the yeast cell pellets in deep-well plates from at -80\u00b0C and put them on ice.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add ~250\u00b5l zirconia beads (0.5 mm) and 500 \u00b5l lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH7.5 with 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% tritonX-100, 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, and Roche protease inhibitor tablet [Roche]) to each well of the yeast plate.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add a capmat to cover each box, and then lysate the yeast cells using the Harbil paint shaker for 2 min X 8 times with interval of 2 min on ice.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cell lysates were centrifuged at 3,500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C; the supernatants were transferred to a filter plate with prewashed 50\u00b5l glutathione beads (GE Healthcare),\n10. Add an additional 500\u00b5l of lysis buffer to the yeast pellet plates, and then repeat the step 8, the supernatants were combined with the previous lysates in step 9.\n11. Seal the top of the filter plate tightly with adhesive foil and stack horizontally on a platform shaker at 4\u00b0C overnight.\n12. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer I (50 mM HEPES at pH7.5 with 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol) and three times with wash buffer II (50 mM HEPES at pH7.5 with 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol). All TFs captured by glutathione beads were stored at -80\u00b0C.\nConjugation of anchor oligo to each protein in 96-well format\n13. Maleimide Modifier modified (5') Anchor oligo was ordered from Genelink. Please note that the cycloadduct should be treated via a retro-Diels-Alder reaction to active maleimide using toluene and heat.\n14. Suspend lyophilized oligo in 1 mL anhydrous Acetonitrile. It will be a suspension as oligo will not dissolve.\n15. \u00a0Evaporate using a speedvac.\n16. \u00a0Re-suspend oligo in 1.5 mL Toluene.\n17. \u00a0Incubate for 4 hrs at 90\u00b0C.\n18. \u00a0Cool to room temperature.\n19. \u00a0Evaporate toluene using a speedvac. Now, the oligonucleotide is now ready for conjugation. Please note that the retro-Diels-Alder reaction should be performed immediately prior to conjugation.\n20. \u00a0Take out the purified TF in 96-well filter plates from at -80\u00b0C and put them on ice.\n21. \u00a0The lyophilized oligos were dissolved in PBS buffer to a final concentration of 50 \u00b5M and added to each purified protein on glutathione beads arrayed in 96-well filter plates.\n22. \u00a0The conjugation was achieved using a \u201cclick\u201d chemistry reaction between the hydro sulphonyl group on cysteine residues of the proteins and a maleimide group tethered to the 5\u2019-end of the anchor oligo at room temperature for 1 hour.\n23. \u00a0The free oligos were removed with three stringent washes (50 mM HEPES at pH=7.5 with 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol) and the anchor oligo-conjugated TFs were stored at -80\u00b0 C until use.\nAssignment of DNA barcodes to TF proteins\n24. \u00a0A collection of 2,000 address oligos (Integrated DNA Technologies) were synthesized, each of which containing a BsaI recognition site and a cutting site (5\u2019-GGTCTCCGACT) at the 5\u2019-end, a 8 nt random sequence as unique molecular identifiers (UMI), a 7-11 nt unique DNA barcode sequence, and a 20-nt consistent sequence, complementary to the anchor oligo.\n25. \u00a0The address oligos were prepared in concentration of 100 \u00b5M in ddH\n2\nO.\n26. \u00a0Six microliters of each of the above address oligo were used to individually prepare the 50 \u00b5l Klenow reaction mixture (1 X NEB Buffer 2 with 0.6 mM dNTP mix, 1 U Klenow [New England Biolabs], and 12 \u00b5M address oligos).\n27. \u00a0Add the 50 \u00b5l Klenow reaction mixture for each address oligo to the Anchor oligo conjugated TFs on glutathione beads in 96-well filter plates.\n28. \u00a0Klenow polymerase reaction was performed at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to synthesize the complementary strands.\n29. \u00a0Free address oligos were removed with three washes (50 mM HEPES at pH=7.5 with 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol).\n30. \u00a0One fifth of the bead slurry for each protein was mixed to prepare the barcoded TF column.\nPreparation of epigenetic modified DNA library\n31. The template oligos of epigenetic modified DNA libraries\nwere synthesized to encode a 5\u2019 Primer 2 (5\u2019-CACATCCTTCACATTAATCC), an 18-mer sequence with a modified CpG in the middle flanked by two 8-mer random sequences, a short sequence encoding the library identity, and a\nBsa\nI recognition site and its cutting site (Table 1). The both 8-mer random regions of template DNA oligos was synthesized in an A:C:G:T ratio of 30:30:20:20, because this ratio is known to provide a more equal distribution of the four bases. In addition, a three-nucleotide barcode was also added to each sequence to identify the different libraries.\n32. The double-stranded DNA libraries were generated by annealing the template oligo with a complementary primer oligo in a 1:1 ratio, followed by a Klenow polymerase reaction according to the manual (M0210, New England Biolabs), in the presence or absence of the modified dCTPs to create symmetric or hemi libraries, respectively. In addition, an unmodified DNA library of the same design was also created as a reference library.\n33. Each library was purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n34. The four libraries with four different symmetric modifications and the unmodified library were mixed in an equimolar ratio to form the mixture of symmetric modification libraries. A mixture of the hemi-modification libraries was created using the same method in parallel.\nIdentification of readers for different epigenetic DNA modifications\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The barcoded TF columns were incubated with 200 nmole of the mixture of symmetric or hemi modification libraries, in a TF binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 with 50 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, and 4% glycerol) at room temperature for 30 min.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After three stringent washes with binding buffer and 1 X PBS buffer, the protein-DNA complexes on the beads were crosslinked by 5 ml of 0.1% formaldehyde in PBS buffer for 10 min.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min was applied to remove the formaldehyde. Then, the beads were incubated with 10 ml of Tris-Glycine buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 7.5) for 10 min to quench the residual formaldehyde in the system.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The beads were washed in 10 ml TBST buffer (0.01% tween-20) three times and equilibrated by 1 X T4 DNA ligase buffer. Then, remove all the buffer in the beads by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adding a master reaction mixture (227 \u00b5L of ddH\n2\nO with 30 \u03bcL 10 X T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer, 30 \u03bcg bovine serum albumin, 20 \u00b5L of 100 U of\nBsa\nI [New England Biolabs], and 20 \u00b5L of 600 U T4 DNA ligase [Enzymatics]) to the beads and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C to perform the Golden Gate Assembly reaction, which could connect the identity of a protein to its captured DNA fragments via proximity ligation in a highly multiplexed reaction.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twenty microliter of Proteinase K was added to the beads and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C to digest proteins on beads to release the ligated DAPPL products.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Phenol/Chloroform extraction and QIAquick PCR Purification Kit were applied to clean the ligated DAPPL products according to their manuals.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ligated DAPPL products were amplified by PCR using the common primers of the libraries.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the PCR products were separated by 10% TBE gel and the target bands with correct size were cut and subjected to deep-sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer using the commercial kit.\n10. The sequencing reads could be readily mapped back to each TF using specific unique barcode for each protein.\n11. The binding sequences from a modified library and the unmodified library for each protein were compared and subjected to identification of candidate readers for different epigenetic marks. The binding consensus sequences (i.e., motifs) for each TF protein were computed using HOMER (http://biowhat.ucsd.edu/HOMER)."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Identifying readers of epigenetic marks on DNA is a critical step towards understanding the mechanisms of those modifications in many biological processes. Here, we present an all-to-all approach, dubbed digital affinity profiling via proximity ligation (DAPPL), to simultaneously profile readers for different epigenetic modifications (i.e., 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine) on CpG dinucleotides using random DNA libraries. Using specific DNA fragments to covalently barcode each human TFs and co-factors, we could connect the identity of a protein to its captured DNA fragments via proximity ligation in a highly multiplexed. Using this approach, we identified numerous readers for different DNA epigenetic modifications</p>",
