            "content": "As the gold standard for the detection of CRP in clinical diagnostics, ELISA exhibits high-throughput, excellent reproducibility, high precision and remarkable sensitivity. Last five decades have accumulated over 300,000 peer-reviewed articles related to ELISA. In particular, the last decade has also witnessed considerable advances in diversified CRP assay formats<sup>1-22</sup>, lateral flow<sup>20</sup>, immunoturbidimetry<sup>1,11</sup>, surface plasmon resonance<sup>14</sup>, piezoresistive cantilever-based IA<sup>10</sup>, chemiluminescent IA<sup>3</sup>, impedimetry<sup>23</sup>, electrochemistry<sup>17</sup>, reflectometric interference spectroscopy<sup>19</sup>, microfluidics<sup>7</sup> and homogenous bead-based IA<sup>24</sup>. In general, most of these assay formats are based on a complex procedure comprising of many process steps with a lengthy analysis time<sup>25-28</sup>. Therefore, there is uttermost importance for the development of rapid and cost-effective IA procedures with high precision and minimal process steps to guide healthcare professionals to decide on the desired intervention at an early stage. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRP, a pentameric protein with a molecular weight of 118 kDa, is a member of a class of acute-phase reactants indicating activation of innate and adaptive immunity<sup>13,29,30</sup>. It plays an important role in host defense by binding to phosphocholine and related microbial molecules. As an early indicator of infectious or inflammatory conditions<sup>31,32</sup>, CRP is usually elevated in patients with neonatal sepsis<sup>33-35</sup>, meningitis, pancreatitis, pneumonia and pelvic inflammatory disease and occult bacteremia. The significantly elevated serum CRP levels are associated with malignant diseases, bacterial infections and correlate with  increased 30-day mortality rates in hospitalized patients<sup>36</sup>. The monomeric CRP binds to the surface of damaged cells and platelets, thereby activating the complement cascade that plays an important role in inflammation. The American Heart Association/Center for Disease Control has considered CRP as the best inflammatory marker for clinical diagnosis<sup>37</sup>. The precise and rapid determination of human C-reactive protein \\(CRP) is essential for diagnosis and management of neonatal sepsis<sup>33-35,38,39</sup>, cardiovascular diseases<sup>40-44</sup>, infectious/inflammatory conditions<sup>31</sup> and diabetes<sup>45-47</sup>. The ability for repeated CRP measurements with high precision in an acute setting provides clinicians with the valuable information to assess disease diagnosis and circumvent any unnecessary administration of antibiotics. The normal CRP levels in  human serum are usually below 10 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> <sup>30</sup> but up to 350-400 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> in several disease states. The CRP levels in the ranges of 10-40 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>, 40-200 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>, and >200 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> are the indicators of mild or chronic inflammation and viral infections; acute inflammation and bacterial infections; and severe bacterial infections and burns, respectively<sup>30</sup>. The CRP levels beyond the cut-off point of 5 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> are indicative of neonatal sepsis, which is diagnosed based on the determination of two CRP concentration ranges normal \\(0.2-480 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>) and high sensitivity \\(0.08-80 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>30</sup>. The high sensitivity CRP assay is performed first, but the normal CRP assay is also performed if the CRP levels are >80 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe existing analytical techniques for the determination of CRP have limitations in terms of prolonged IA duration and lower analytical sensitivity, as reviewed recently by Algarra _et al._<sup>22</sup>. The clinical laboratory-based CRP assays, based on latex agglutination or nephelometry, and phosphocholine and O-phosphorylethanolamine based immunoassays can detect CRP only in the detection range of \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>. On the other hand, the recently developed immunoassay formats, based on electrochemical techniques, nanoparticles, nanocomposites, chemiluminescence, total internal reflection and micromosiac immunoassays, have higher sensitivities in the range of ng mL<sup>-1</sup> to \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>. Similarly, the surface plasmon resonance based real-time and label-free immunoassay formats have sensitivity between ng mL<sup>-1</sup> to g mL<sup>-1</sup>. Therefore, there is a critical need for a highly simplified, cost-effective, precise and highly sensitive IA format for the rapid detection of CRP.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe have developed a rapid one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure<sup>48</sup> \\(**Figure 1**) to detect CRP in human whole blood and serum in less than 30 min. It has critically reduced the IA duration by more than 12-fold and the analysis cost by 2.5-fold in comparison to the conventional procedure. This novel ELISA format required also significantly reduced number of process steps and only two washing steps in comparison to the conventional counterpart \\(**Table S1**). Moreover, the high analytical precision of the developed procedure implies its tremendous potential for rapid analyte detection in clinical and bioanalytical settings."

            "content": "The developed CRP sandwich ELISA critically reduced the IA assay duration by 12-fold, from 6 h \\(commercial CRP sandwich ELISA) to just 30 min, based on the use of Ab-bound Dynabeads<sup>\u00ae</sup>/MTPs. The developed ELISA is cost-effective and highly-simplified as attested by the minimal process steps and 2.5-fold reduced IA components in comparison to the conventional ELISA procedure \\(**Tables S1, S2**). It detects 0.3-81.0 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> of CRP with linearity in the range of 1-81 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> \\(**Figure 2A**). LOD, analytical sensitivity and correlation coefficient \\(R<sup>2</sup>) are determined to be 0.4 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, 0.7 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.998, respectively \\(**Table S2**). The intraday and interday variability determined from five assay repeats \\(in triplicate) in a single day and five consecutive days, respectively, are in the ranges of 0.7-10.8 and 1.6-11.2, respectively. The developed ELISA can detect the entire pathophysiological range of hsCRP from 3-80 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> in human whole blood and serum after appropriate dilution, as demonstrated by the detection of CRP spiked in diluted whole blood and plasma \\(**Figure 2A**). It has high specificity for CRP, as demonstrated by the use of various experimental process controls \\(**Figure 2B**) that shows no detectable interference with the immunological reagents. The optimum duration for the formation of the sandwich immune complex by the one-step kinetics-based procedure is 15 min, while the optimum number of magnet-assisted washings thereafter is only two \\(**Figure S1**).\r\n\n\nThe developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs have the same analytical precision for the detection of CRP in diluted whole blood and serum as the results are in agreement with each other \\(**Table 2**). The percentage recovery for the CRP-spiked diluted human whole blood is in the range of 93.3-107.0 and 94.0-103.3 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. Similarly, the percentage recovery for CRP-spiked diluted human serum ranges from 103.3 -108.0, compared to 93.3-113.0 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. The results obtained for the detection of CRP in the EDTA plasma samples of patients by the developed ELISA are also in good agreement with those obtained by the conventional ELISA \\(**Table 3**). The anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads<sup>\u00ae</sup> can be stored for more than 4 months at 4 \u00baC without compromising the CRP detection response \\(**Figure 2C**). The production variability for the preparation of anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads<sup>\u00ae</sup>, using the same lots of Dynabeads<sup>\u00ae</sup> and anti-CRP capture Ab, is less than 3 percent \\(**Figure 2D**). Moreover, the developed ELISA using SA-HRP/biotinylated anti-CRP Ab conjugate is similar to the variant of the developed ELISA procedure that employs the two-step binding of biotinylated anti-CRP Ab and SA-HRP \\(**Figure S2A**). The one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA solution  \\(comprising anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads<sup>\u00ae</sup> and biotinylated anti-CRP detection Ab preconjugated to SA-HRP, stored at 4 \u00baC in BSA-preblocked MTPs) exhibited no noticeable decrease in its functional activity for up to 4 weeks \\(**Figure S2B**). Therefore, taking into account the attributes of the developed generic sandwich ELISA procedure, it can be reliably employed in clinical and bioanalytical settings. Moreover, it has immense potential for the development of novel and fully automated rapid IVD kits in combination with lab-on-a-chip technologies, microfluidics, nanotechnology and smart system integration."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "A rapid one-step kinetics-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent \\(ELISA) procedure has been developed for highly-sensitive detection of C-reactive protein \\(CRP) in less than 30 min. With minimal process steps, the procedure is highly simplified and cost-effective. The analysis only involves sequentially the formation of a sandwich immune complex on capture anti-CRP antibody \\(Ab)-bound Dynabeads, followed by two magnet-assisted washings and an enzymatic reaction. The developed immunoassay \\(IA) detected CRP in the dynamic range of 0.3-81 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> with a limit of detection and analytical sensitivity of 0.4 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.7 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>. Its analytical precision for analysis of CRP spiked in diluted human serum, whole blood, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid \\(EDTA) plasma samples of patients was validated by conventional ELISA, unravelling its immense potential for _in vitro_ diagnostics \\(IVD).",
