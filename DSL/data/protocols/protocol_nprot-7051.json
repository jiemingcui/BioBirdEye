            "content": "_S. pneumoniae_ \\(pneumococcus) is a gram positive, extracellular bacterium. Although it exists as a commensal in the upper respiratory tract of roughly 10% of adult carriers, it has the potential to cause severe disease in susceptible individuals, most notably young children, the elderly and those with immunodeficiency. Pneumococcal disease results from local spread, aspiration or bacteraemia, and range from otitis media and sinusitis to pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis \\[1]. Secondary _S. pneumoniae_ infections following influenza A infection are common, and _S. pneumoniae_ also play a significant role in exacerbation of chronic lung pathologies such as COPD \\[2, 3]. Two effective capsular polysaccharide vaccines are in widespread use. Pneumovax is a T-independent 23-valent vaccine, and Prevenar is a 13-valent protein conjugated T-dependent vaccine. However, vaccination protects only against serotypes included in the vaccine, and serotype replacement can mitigate efficacy at a population level over time \\[4]. Mouse models of _S. pneumoniae_ infection and disease progression play an important role in increasing our understanding of host-pathogen interaction and identifying the factors that modulate _S. pneumoniae_ pathogenicity as well as evaluating universal protein or whole cell based vaccine strategies \\[4]. The properties of the mouse strain as well as _S. pneumoniae_ strain and serotype should be carefully considered alongside the infection route and dose to ensure that the experimental design is appropriate to the research question \\[5]. In this protocol we describe the establishment of an intranasal _S. pneumoniae_ lung infection model and characterisation of the resulting immune response which allows us to study different stages of disease progression including upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, bacteraemia as well as bacterial clearance and recovery. This model enabled us to assess the effects of genetic manipulation and/or treatment on disease progression and the immune response, and led to the discovery that B cells could exacerbate acute _S. pneumoniae_ infections by an antibody independent mechanism \\[6]."

Collect the bacteria by centrifugation at 3000xg for 20min at 4\u00b0C and resuspended at OD\n600\n= 1.0 in cold PBS/20% glycerol \\(Sigma-Aldrich), keep on ice while preparing 1mL aliquots.\r\n  4. Proceed to snap freeze aliquots in liquid N\n2\n\\(keep a non-frozen control aliquot on ice to assess viability).\r\n  5. Assess stocks for viable CFU counts and homogeneity by plating out serial dilutions of three frozen samples and 1 non-frozen control sample on blood agar plates \\(LB agar, supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood \\(Oxoid))\r\n  6. Incubate the plates for 24h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\n. \r\n  7. Confirm _S. pneumoniae_ colonies by the presence of an \u03b1-haemolytic zone and sensitivity to optochin \\(Sigma-Aldrich). \r\n  8. Count colonies and calculate stock CFU concentration. \\(Viability of frozen stocks should be >90% compared to the non-frozen control sample).\r\n  9. Maintain virulent stocks by performing _in vivo_ passage every 6-12 months \\(Infect a mouse with _S. pneumoniae_, collect the spleen 24h post infection. Culture _S. pneumoniae_ colonies from the spleen and use collected colonies to inoculate broth in step 1). \r\n  \r\n\n\n  \r\n\n\n**Intranasal administration of S. pneumoniae**\r\n\n\n_Note 1: There is a considerable difference in virulence between S. pneumoniae strains and serotypes, and also variation within the same strain and serotype between laboratories. Therefore, it is important to perform dose-finding pilot experiments before embarking on a full-scale study._\r\n\n\n_Note 2: Full training and competency assessment in anaesthesia of laboratory animals is required._\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n1. Thaw frozen stocks and wash twice by centrifugation \\(5000xg for 5min) in sterile PBS \r\n  2. Resuspend at 4x10\n7\nCFU/mL in PBS\r\n  3. Keep the suspension on ice at all times and use for infection within 2 hours of thawing \\(no loss of viability was observed under these conditions).  \r\n  4. Induce anaesthesia in mice by inhalation of 3% isoflurane for 2-3min and maintain with 2% isoflurane for up to 6min.\r\n  5. Visually, respiration should appear slow, deep and even \\(not gasping), with no reflex present if the nose is gently touched with clean tissue paper. \r\n  6. Hold the mouse in a supine position, allowing the head to tilt slightly backwards.  \r\n  7. Mix the _S. pneumoniae_ suspension well and collect 50\u00b5L \\(containing 2x10\n6\nCFU) using a pipette, and place small droplets of the suspension on the nostrils, allowing the mouse to inhale each droplet before placing the next one. \r\n  8. Once the full 50\u00b5L dose is inhaled, place the mouse in the cage in a supine position and observe to confirm inhalation of the dose and full recovery from anaesthesia: mice should re-gain their righting reflex within 1 minute and normal mobility within 3 minutes.   \r\n  9. After infecting all the mice in the study group, prepare serial dilutions of the inoculum and plate on blood agar plates to confirm the infection dose. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**S. pneumoniae survival studies:**\r\n\n\n1. Record pre-infection body weights and assess animals to ensure they are in good health. \r\n  2. Infect mice intranasally with _S. pneumoniae_ as described above. \r\n  3. Record body weights daily \\(preferably at the same time every day), starting at 24h post infection\r\n  4. Monitor animals at least three times a day for a period of 10 days post infection: When signs of sickness are observed monitoring frequency should be increased, including out of hours checks. \r\n  5. We assess disease progression by assigning clinical scores according to the scheme below \\(Table 3). Animals are culled when they show >25% bodyweight loss or reach score 3. The most frequently observed clinical signs are piloerection, hunched posture, tremor, and laboured breathing.  Rarely, mice may show signs of inner ear infection: head tilting, loss of balance or circling.  These animals are culled straight away and excluded from the study. \r\n  6. Collect blood and tissues for analysis when animals are culled and/or at the study end-point.\nSee figure in Figures section.\n**Vaccines and treatments**\r\n\n\n1. To induce a T-independent antibody response, immunise mice with Pneumovax II \\(pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur MSD); To induce a T-dependent antibody response, use Prevenar 13 \\(pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine, Diphtheria CRM197 protein, Pfizer). \r\n  a) Pneumovax: Immunise mice with one 100\u00b5L \\(0.4\u00b5g) dose \\(1:12.5 dilution in sterile PBS) by intraperitoneal injection, 14 days before infection with _S. pneumoniae_. Include a PBS treated vehicle control group.\r\n\n\nb) Prevenar: Immunise mice with four 100\u00b5L \\(0.34\u00b5g) doses \\(1:6.4 dilution in sterile PBS) given 14 days apart by intraperitoneal injection, with the last dose 14 days before infection with _S. pneumoniae_. Include a PBS treated vehicle control group. \r\n\n\n2. Collect serum from pre- and post-immunisation blood samples to assess antibody levels.  \r\n  3. \\(Optional) Other treatments can be applied before or after _S. pneumoniae_ infection to assess their effects on disease progression and/or immune response. Some examples include cytokines, neutralising antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Single cell isolation: Lung and spleen**\r\n\n\n1. Apply treatments and/or infect mice with _S. pneumoniae_ as described above. \r\n  2. At the desired timepoint post-infection, euthanise mice by CO\n2\ninhalation followed by gentle cervical dislocation to confirm death \\(Avoid damage to cervical blood vessels and trachea).\r\n  3. Collect blood samples from the abdominal aorta into appropriate containers: Serum collection tubes \\(BD microtainer, SST) or K\n+\nEDTA coated tubes \\(Sarstedt Microvette) for plasma and/or blood cell analysis.\r\n  4. \\(optional) Collect bronchial-alveolar lavage \\(BAL) fluid:\r\n  a. Use a needle to create a small opening in the trachea above the larynx\r\n\n\nb.

Use a high-level disinfectant such as Distel, Trigene or Virkon to clean all work surfaces, and ensure sterility of flasks and growth medium.\r\n\n\n**Poor viability/ growth:** \r\n\n\n\u2022 Viability will decrease when cultures are allowed to grow past mid-log phase. Take regular OD<sub>600</sub> readings and proceed to collect bacteria using a pre-cooled centrifuge as soon as the culture reaches OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5-0.7. Prolonged periods at room temperature could also affect viability, therefore work quickly to snap-freeze aliquots as soon as possible after the culture is harvested and keep samples on ice at all times during the process.  \r\n\n\n\u2022 Poor growth on blood ager plates/ absence of a clear \u03b1-haemolytic ring around _S. pneumoniae_ colonies can result from lysis of the sheep blood. Ensure the agar cools to 50\u00b0C before adding the blood as higher temperatures will result in lysis. Store prepared plates at 4\u00b0C for up to 5 days.

Ensure _S. pneumoniae_ stocks are pure with high viability before administration to animals. Keep diluted _S. pneumoniae_ stock on ice at all times and administer to animals within two hours of defrosting a frozen aliquot.  \r\n\n\n**Animals recover from anaesthesia before inhaling the full dose:** \r\n\n\n\u2022 Anaesthesia is not deep enough: Ensure animals are breathing deeply and evenly and show no reflex when the nose is touched with a piece of clean tissue paper. The entire 50\u00b5L dose should be administered within 20-30s, allowing roughly 1min for the animal to remain in a supine position before recovery.  \r\n\n\n**Animals take longer than expected to recover from anaesthesia/gasping breathing is present:** \r\n\n\n\u2022 Anaesthesia is too deep. Remove animals from the anaesthetic chamber and observe to ensure full recovery. Animals should be closely observed while in the anaesthetic chamber at all times. \r\n\n\n**Higher/lower than expected mortality rates following S. pneumoniae infection:**\r\n\n\n\u2022 Since there is considerable variation in virulence between different _S. pneumoniae_ strains and serotypes, pilot studies should be used to determine the optimum dose. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Repeated _in vitro_ passage of _S. pneumoniae_ stock can lead to reduced virulence over time. Therefore, it is recommended to perform _in vivo_ passage by culturing new stock from _S. pneumoniae_ colonies recovered from the spleens of infected mice every 6-12 months.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Plating out the diluted _S. pneumoniae_ stock used for infection is recommended to confirm viability and absence of contamination, as it is often helpful to rule out these factors should the study not progress as expected.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Immune cell characterisation by flow cytometry**\r\n\n\n\u2022 Multicolour antibody panels require optimisation and small pilot experiments are recommended to establish a panel for larger studies. \r\n\n\n\u2022 High autofluorescence is a characteristic of several cell types found in the lung, most notably alveolar macrophages. It is therefore recommended to avoid fluorochromes with low peak emission wavelengths for identification of alveolar macrophages \\(PE and Alexa-647 are good choices for these cells). In addition, fluorescence-minus-one controls should be used to set gates accurately. \r\n\n\n\u2022 High background and non-specific staining can also result from high levels of debris/dead cells in the samples and could be a problem especially in lung samples. High levels of debris/clumps of dead cells can also block the flow cytometer and lead to aberrant results. The Percoll separation step should remove debris but if some remain the samples can be filtered prior to analysis. CellTrics 30\u03bcm filters \\(SYSMEX) work well for small sample volumes. Always use a viability dye to exclude dead cells."

            "content": "**S. pneumoniae stock preparation**\r\n\n\nFrozen _S. pneumoniae_ stocks should be free of contamination and have >90% viability compared to a non-frozen control aliquot. To avoid adverse effects, stocks with <90% viability should not be used for administration to animals.  In addition, purity should be confirmed in undiluted stock samples by observing a clear optochin inhibition ring on blood agar plates, as well as a green, translucent \u03b1-haemolytic zone around individual colonies in diluted samples.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Intranasal administration of S. pneumoniae, survival studies and vaccines**\r\n\n\nAfter intranasal administration of _S. pneumoniae_, mice are expected to recover from anaesthesia within 3 minutes, and the mice are expected to appear well with normal levels of activity and no respiratory abnormalities. In our hands, one dose of 2x10<sup>6</sup> CFU _S. pneumoniae_ TIGR4, serotype 4 results in 30-50% of wildtype C57Bl/6 mice surviving to 10 days post infection. At 6-8 hours post infection the mice may start to show transiently reduced activity levels and appear subdued; these effects are expected to disappear by 24h post infection. However, at 24h post infection mice are expected to start showing signs of weight loss, followed by increased weight loss and signs of sickness as described in Table 3 from 36-48h onwards. Animals that do not reach the humane end-point during this time are expected to start recovering from 96 hours onwards, and all surviving animals are expected to reach their pre-infection weight by 10 days post infection. It is important to ensure animals in experimental and control groups are age and sex matched \\[9]. We found that males are more susceptible to _S. pneumoniae_ infection compared to female mice, although this was not associated with increased weight loss in male mice \\(Figure 1). \r\n\n\nImmunisation with Pneumovax or Prevenar-13 prior to infection is expected to provide >90% protection against disease progression in wildtype C57Bl/6 mice \\(Figure 2).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7181/original/Figure_1.jpg?1537429641\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7183/original/Figure_2.jpg?1537429643\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n**CFU counts, Single cell isolation and Immune cell characterisation** \r\n\n\nWe focused our CFU count and immune cell characterisation studies on the 24h post infection time-point because we are interested in the immune response to acute infection. At 24h most animals start to show weight loss but appear clinically healthy. These analyses can also be applied to other time-points; However, it should be considered that the interpretation of results at later time-points can be complicated because study groups will contain individuals with a wide variation in health status which could affect experimental readouts independently of genotype or treatment. In addition, analysis at later time-points will invariably select for individuals surviving to that timepoint. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe expect lung CFU counts to remain stable for the first 6 hours post infection, then reduce and become more variable from 24h onwards. We expect mice to start showing bacteraemia as measured by CFU in the spleen from 24h onwards \\(Figure 3).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7185/original/Figure_3.jpg?1537429644\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe suggested flow cytometry staining panels allows the detection of different lymphocyte and myeloid populations of interest to our studies and should be adjusted to individual research questions. A detailed flow cytometry protocol for the identification of lung macrophage and dendritic cell subsets is provided by Misharin et al  \\[10]. Examples of gating strategies for the identification of lymphocyte and myeloid cell populations in the lung at 24h post _S. pneumoniae_ infection are shown in Figures 4 and 5 respectively.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7187/original/Figure_4.jpg?1537434748\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7189/original/Figure_5.jpg?1537436036\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe do not observe significant lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs during the first 24h post infection. Alveolar macrophage numbers are also expected to remain constant during the first 24h post infection, while neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes are expected to increase from 6-8h onwards, peak at 24h post infection and then start to decrease \\(Figure 6). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7191/original/Figure_6.jpg?1537429650\">See figure in Figures section.</a>"
