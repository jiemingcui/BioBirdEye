            "content": "The successful generation and culture of human pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells \\(hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells \\(iPSCs), provides an unlimited cell resource for medical and biomedical applications such as cell therapy and disease modelling, as these cells possess the remarkable ability to give rise to all the cell lineages that make up the adult organism whilst also being able to be cultured indefinitely under increasingly defined conditions. However, all these applications require the specification of pluripotent stem cells into specific cell types via one of the three embryonic germ layers; a challenging task that has attracted the attention of numerous researchers over the last few decades. Definitive endoderm \\(DE), one of the three germ layer lineages, is the predecessor of several important organs and functional cell types, including hepatocytes, pancreatic \u03b2-cells, intestinal and lung epithelia1-5, underscoring the essential role of DE in the generation of these functional cell types. Therefore, efficient specification of DE is a key step for the successful generation of functional downstream cell types3, 6, and is important for the development of regenerative therapies as well as disease modelling and drug discovery.\r\n\n\nDirected differentiation of hPSCs in 2-dimensional culture system has been shown to be an effective approach in generating large numbers of DE cells, in which a high dosage of Activin A is essential component due to the important role of Nodal/Activin-Smad signalling plays during DE development in vivo3, 6, 7. However, Activin treatment alone has been shown to be insufficient for inducing an efficient DE differentiation, which requires the concurrent inhibition of PI3K signalling8, 9. In a recent study to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms behind this requirement, we have demonstrated that PI3K inhibits Activin-induced DE differentiation of hESCs via direct attenuation of Smad2/3 activity through the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 \\(mTORC2). Activation of mTORC2 promotes the phosphorylation of the Smad2/3 linker T220/T179 residue which enables the recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase to the active Smad2/3, resulting in the degradation of Smad2/3 and reduction of its activity10. This finding enabled us to develop an alternative approach for the DE differentiation of hPSCs in which treatment of hESCs with Activin is coupled with suppression of mTOR signalling \\(Fig. 1). This new approach leads to a robust DE differentiation without gross cell death, therefore increasing the yield of DE cells and greatly benefiting the production of downstream functional cell types, such as hepatocyte-like cells."

Thaw the aliquot just before use at 37 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\nCritical Step: Collagenase activity varies between lots, therefore adjust either the volume or amount of collagenase powder accordingly to achieve 200 U ml-1 activity. \r\n\n\nDE induction medium \\(50 ml)\r\n\n\n\u2022 Under sterile conditions, add 1 ml B27 supplement to 50 ml RPMI AQmedia. Filter sterilise using 0.22 \u00b5m filter unit and store at 4 \u00b0C for up to a week.

Base media can be stored for up to 2 weeks.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n**EQUIPMENT SETUP**\r\n\n\n Matrigel coated plates\r\n\n\n\u2022 Thaw stock Matrigel\u00ae overnight on ice at 4 \u00b0C and dilute 1 in 2 with chilled KO-DMEM before aliquoting into 15 ml tubes at 1 ml per tube and store at -20 \u00b0C. To make plates, thaw aliquots at 4 \u00b0C overnight before diluting 1 in 15 with chilled KO-DMEM. Coat each well of one 6 well plate with 1 ml of the new dilution. Allow plates to set at 4 \u00b0C overnight and warm for at least 20 min at room temperature before use. Seal plates with parafilm to prevent evaporation before storage. Upon use, aspirate off excess solution and replace with the appropriate volume of MEF-CM prior to hESC passaging. In emergency circumstances, plates can be made on the day of passaging and allowed to set for a minimum of 4 hours at room temperature before use. Homogeneity of the coating can be verified using a phase contrast light microscope. Plates stored at 4 \u00b0C should be used within 2 weeks. \r\n\n\nCritical Step: Matrigel sets rapidly at room temperature, to avoid gelling and clumping, ensure that Matrigel solutions are defrosted slowly at 4 \u00b0C. Do not let the Matrigel-coated wells dry out after excess is removed. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PROCEDURE**\r\n\n\n**Stage 0: Preparation of hESCs for DE differentiation**\r\n\n\nSteps 1 \u2013 2: Generation of MEF-CM from KSR medium\r\n\n\nTiming: 10 \u2013 14 d\r\n\n\n1 Thaw frozen MEFs \\(passage 0) and grow in DMEM AQmedia containing 10% FBS. Passage 3 to 4 times in order to obtain sufficient number of vigorously growing cells. Trypsinise the cells and irradiate for 40 Gy using a cell irradiator to abolish their replicative potential. Seed irradiated MEFs at a density of 2.5 x 107 cells into T225 flasks that have been pre-coated with 0.5% gelatin for 20 min and allow cells to plate down overnight. The following day, rinse cells once with DPBS and replace growth medium with 150 ml KSR medium supplemented with 4 ng ml-1 FGF-2. Allow the MEFs to condition the media for 24 hours and collect into 150 ml sterile storage bottles. Immediately freeze at -80 \u00b0C to maintain quality of the MEF-CM. Repeat collection for up to 7 days. \r\n\n\n2 Thaw bottles of frozen MEF-CM in the water bath until fully defrosted. Supplement with a further 1 mM of L-Glutamine and filter through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter unit to remove residual MEF cell debris. Take out the required volume for required for daily feed to warm and store the leftover medium at 4 \u00b0C for up to a week. Supplement with 10 ng ml-1 FGF-2 immediately prior to addition to hESCs. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 3: Culture and expansion of hESCs\r\n\n\nTiming: 5 \u2013 7 d\r\n\n\n3 Culture and maintain hESCs as colonies with daily exchange of complete MEF-CM for 5-7 days by which they should be almost confluent. For each well this would be 3 ml daily. Prior to passaging, ensure appropriate Matrigel plate has been warmed to room temperature for a minimum of 20 min and contains 2 ml per well MEF-CM. Passage 1 well of hESCs by treating with 1 ml collagenase IV for 5 to 10 min followed by a DPBS rinse. Replace DPBS with 1 ml MEF-CM and detach colonies by gently scraping with the tip of a 5 ml pipette. Add a further 2 ml MEF-CM and break up the colonies by gentle pipetting 3-4 times using a 5 ml pipette. Transfer 1 ml of the cell solution into 3 wells of the new plate to achieve a 1:3 split.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Stage 1: DE differentiation in a Chemically Defined Medium**\r\n\n\nSteps 4 \u2013 9: Accutase/ROCKi split of hESCs for DE conversion\r\n\n\nTiming: 1-2 h\r\n\n\n4 Culture and maintain hESCs as in Step 3 until wells are confluent and are typically ready for passaging.\r\n\n\n5 Defrost and warm Accutase solution and an appropriate volume of KO-DMEM to 37 \u00b0C. Warm appropriate Matrigel gel plate to room temperature and prepare aliquot of MEF-CM. \r\n\n\n6 Aspirate off MEF-CM and rinse cells once with DPBS. For one well, exchange DPBS with 1 ml warm Accutase solution and incubate for 5 to 10 min until colonies are disassociated into single cells.\r\n\n\n7 Neutralise Accutase solution with 2 ml of KO-DMEM per well, pipette cell suspension through a 1 ml Gilson pipette tip to further dissociate any remaining clumps. Flush the wells and transfer into a 15 ml tube. Centrifuge cell suspension at 60g for 5 min to pellet the cells. During centrifugation, prepare the Matrigel plates for seeding by transferring 2 ml MEF-CM into each well. Ensure that MEF-CM contains both 10 ng ml-1 FGF-2 and 10 \u00b5M ROCK inhibitor. \r\n\n\n8 After centrifugation, aspirate supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 3 ml MEF-CM supplemented with 10 ng ml-1 FGF-2 and 10 \u00b5M ROCK inhibitor. Dispense 1 ml per well of the new plate to achieve a 1:3 split. Allow cells to plate down overnight and verify formation of a homogenous cell monolayer the following day. \r\n\n\n9 To remove residual ROCK inhibitor, exchange medium with fresh MEF-CM supplemented with FGF-2 only and incubate overnight. The cells are now ready for DE induction.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSteps 10 \u2013 13: Induction of DE using Activin and Torin\r\n\n\nTiming: 2 \u2013 3 d \r\n\n\n10 Warm an appropriate aliquot of DE induction medium to 37 \u00b0C. Supplement with 100 ng ml-1 and 15 nM Torin and exchange with MEF-CM to induce the DE differentiation. Observe the cells daily to note key phenotypic changes that reflect the progress of differentiation.\r\n\n\n11 The following day, cells will start to adopt a spiky morphology that is reminiscent of cells from the primitive streak and appear as spiked clusters. However, cell death should largely be minimal. Exchange with the same medium as Step 10 for another day to continue the differentiation.\r\n\n\n12 By day 2 of differentiation the majority of the cells will adopt a spiky morphology. Clusters will also begin to disperse as the cells proceed through EMT and gain mobility. Again, exchange with the same medium to complete the DE differentiation.\r\n\n\n13 By day 3 differentiation should largely be complete. Clusters should be minimal or absent and the predominant cell type are cells that possess a sharp and well-defined polygonal appearance. Cells can be lysed for analysis at this stage or subjected to further differentiation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Stage 2: Hepatic Specification**\r\n\n\nSteps 14 \u2013 15: Hepatoblast specification from AA/Torin induced DE\r\n\n\nTiming: 3 \u2013 5 d\r\n\n\n14 To initiate hepatoblast specification, exchange DE induction medium with hepatoblast specification medium supplemented with 20 ng ml\n-1\nBMP-2 and 10 ng ml\n-1\nFGF-2. Since the cytotoxicity of Torin is rather low, cultures can at this stage become too confluent and compacted. If this arises, split the cells onto Matrigel-coated plates using Accutase at a 1:2 ratio and continue the culture. \r\n\n\nCritical Step: Avoid splitting the cells at a large ratio as hepatoblast maturation requires cell-cell contacts to be maintained.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n15 Exchange media daily and observe the phenotypic changes to track the progress of the differentiation. Cells initially increase in size but maintain a rough border between each other which gradually becomes more pronounced as the differentiation proceeds. After 3-5 days the cells largely adopt a polygonal morphology that is characteristic of hepatoblasts, however the more mature features such as prominent nucleus and binucleated cells remain absent.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Stage 3: Hepatic Maturation**\r\n\n\nSteps 16 \u2013 17: Hepatocyte maturation from hepatoblasts\r\n\n\nTiming: 3 \u2013 5 d\r\n\n\n16 By day 5 of hepatoblast specification, the cells are largely fated to become hepatocyte-like cell morphology, however they require further culture to adopt a phenotype that functionally mimics that of primary hepatocytes. To initiate the maturation step, exchange the hepatoblast specification medium with hepatocyte maturation medium supplemented with 20 ng ml\n-1\nOSM, 10 ng ml-1 HGF and 50 \u00b5g ml-1 ascorbic acid. \r\n\n\n17 Exchange media daily and observe phenotypic changes to track the progress of the differentiation. Cells visibly increase in size and the cell-cell borders become more reinforced and prominent. Mononucleated and binucleated cells appear with increasing frequency and by the latter stages, cells begin to accumulate lipid droplets. At this stage, cells can be taken for functional assays or lysed for gene expression or protein analysis. Cells can be kept in this state for no longer than 3 days."

At this stage, pluripotency markers such as Oct4 and Nanog are reduced but not completely absent due to their additional role in promoting endoderm specification, however Sox2 which has been largely shown to be a neural promoting factor should be drastically downregulated10. \r\n\n\nThe identity of DE cells can be further confirmed by differentiation towards the hepatic or pancreatic linages. Application of BMP-2 and FGF-2 act to further specify DE towards the hepatic fate over 3 to 5 days, resulting in a gradual conversion of the spiky cells towards a more polygonal morphology \\(Fig. 1b). Cells begin to express foetal liver markers such as AFP. Further maturation of these cells results in the downregulation of AFP accompanied by increased albumin synthesis. The cells are able to perform certain liver-associated functions such as urea synthesis and expression of drug metabolising enzymes such as CYP3A4."

This protocol details the highly efficient generation of DE from human embryonic stem cells \\(hESCs) by combinational treatment under defined conditions with Activin A and Torin-2, a highly specific inhibitor that acts against the mechanistic target of rapamycin \\(mTOR). This protocol is both cost-effective and couples lower cytotoxicity with a greater yield of DE cells by 3 days of differentiation. To ensure the quality of DE differentiation, we also include a procedure to further differentiate the resulting DE cells into hepatocyte-like cells, with the entire procedure taking around 15 days to complete. This procedure represents a significant advancement towards the derivation of DE, which will ultimately improve both the yield and functional characteristics of DE-derived mature cells types such as hepatocyte-like cells.",
