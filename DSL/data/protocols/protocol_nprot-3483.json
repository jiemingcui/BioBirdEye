            "content": "The bacterial cell wall is mainly composed of peptidoglycan \\(PGN). Since its first isolation in 1951 by Salton and Horne \\(1) PGN composition has been intensively studied with various methods. The original determination of the glycan and peptide composition was performed by paper chromatography \\(2). The breakthrough was by Glauner in 1988 \\(3), who for the first time applied high pressure liquid chromatography \\(HPLC) technology on the analysis of muropeptides. Muropeptides result from enzymatic digestion of the glycan strands into disaccharides, with part of them still being cross-linked by peptides to various extensions. Glauner extensively studied the effects of pH, buffer concentrations, and temperature on HPLC separation of muropeptides of the Gram-negative bacterium _Escherichia coli_. Later, a protocol for PGN isolation and HPLC analysis of the Gram-positive _Staphylococcus aureus_ was established by deJonge _et al._ \\(4). Basically, these two protocols have been used ever since. However, both of them are very time consuming taking about a week to obtain pure PGN. Both protocols rely on multiple boiling steps with sodiumdodecylsulfate \\(SDS), which has to be washed out by extensive ultracentrifugation steps for about an hour each. Last year a protocol for isolation of _E. coli_ PGN for ultra-performance liquid chromatography \\(UPLC) analysis was reported, that is substantially shorter \\(5). However, it still relies on washing in an ultracentrifuge thereby limiting the amounts of samples that can be prepared in parallel. \r\n\n\nWe established a purification protocol which can be completely performed in 2 ml reaction tubes, allowing the isolation of up to 48 samples in parallel or even in 96 well plates, yielding pure muropeptides in 24 hours. The muropeptides can be subsequently analyzed by UPLC. This reduces the amount of sample needed and the analysis time from about three hours \\(HPLC) to 70 min per sample. In addition, the LC conditions were adapted to mass spectrometry \\(MS) with suitable solvents so that the whole PGN can be directly analyzed by UPLC-MS. This allows for muropeptide determination without first collecting and desalting LC peaks and results in a complete PGN mapping. Taken together, the whole procedure is reduced from about two weeks to 24 hours. Furthermore, this fast isolation method also makes it much easier to obtain larger amounts of PGN which can be used to collect special muropeptides that can then be tested for their ability to stimulate the immune system \\(6). \r\n\n\nAs an example for PGN isolation by this new method, UPLC analysis and MS-mapping are presented in \"Fig. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3367/original/Figure-1_Bertsche_.tif?1417688252 and \"Fig. 2\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3369/original/Figure-2_Bertsche_.tif?1417688768. For Gram-positives we used _Staphylococcus aureus_ \\(_S. aureus_) SA1137 and for Gram-negatives _Escherichia coli_ \\(_E. coli_) Nissle 1917 \\(8). The complete results of the muropeptide composition of _S. aureus_ are given in \"Tab. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3371/original/Table_1.pdf?1417689409 and in \"Tab. 2\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3373/original/Table_2.pdf?1417689597 for _E. coli_."

            "content": "_Exemplary analysis of_ S. aureus _SA113 by UPLC and UPLC-MS_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe methicillin sensitive _S. aureus_ strain SA113 was grown over night in BM medium. We isolated its PGN and analyzed it by UPLC as well as by UPLC-MS. This enabled us to directly determine the masses of all muropeptide peaks we got by UPLC separation \\( \"Fig. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3367/original/Figure-1_Bertsche_.tif?1417688252 ). The total ion current \\(TIC) chromatogram obtained by UPLC-MS was almost identical to the UV pattern of UPLC alone with two exceptions: 1) Retention time of the peaks in the quaternary UPLC was about 1 min longer than in the binary UPLC-MS system. Therefore, in \"Tab. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3371/original/Table_1.pdf?1417689409 only the TIC retention times are given. 2) The signal of some muropeptides, that turned out to be O-acetylated, were stronger in the TIC than in the UV \\(e.g. peaks 9 in Fig. 1a and b).\r\n\n\nThe UV chromatogram of the UPLC as well as the TIC chromatogram of the MS show the expected pattern as it had been published before for the methicillin resistant _S. aureus_ COL by de Jonge _et al._ in 1992 \\(4,9). By coupling UPLC to MS we could directly determine the masses and subsequently the potential structures of almost all peaks. The obtained masses verified that the main peaks \\(peaks 5, 11, 15, 16, 17 and 18) contained the expected muropeptides that had already been determined before \\(4,10). We mapped the whole PGN of _S. aureus_ SA113 up to the hexameric cross-linked muropeptide. The complete results of our PGN mapping of _S. aureus_ SA113 is given in \"Tab. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3371/original/Table_1.pdf?1417689409. All structures were drawn by ChemDrawUltra 13.0 \\(PerkinElmer), which automatically calculated the mass of the molecule and the proposed sum formula. The latter is given. As can be judged by the peak forms in the UPLC chromatogram, most peaks are composed of several muropeptides. While all of them have the same basic structure \\(MurNac-GlcNac with stem peptide and Gly<sub>5</sub> interpeptide bridge), several modifications were detected.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Exemplary analysis of_ E. coli _Nissle 1917 by UPLC and UPLC-MS_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAs an example for Gram-negative bacteria we grew _E. coli_ Nissle 1917 overnight in LB medium and isolated its PGN. The PGN was digested by mutanolysin and analyzed by UPLC and UPLC-MS \\( \"Fig. 2\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3369/original/Figure-2_Bertsche_.tif?1417688768 ). Again, the UV pattern was very similar to the TIC chromatogram and we could determine the masses of most muropeptide peaks. The masses we found resulted in proposed muropeptide structures that are in accordance with the ones previously published by Glauner \\(3). The complete analysis is given in \"Tab. 2\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3373/original/Table_2.pdf?1417689597. We did obtain masses for the peaks between minutes 14 and 21, but they did not fit any muropeptide structures and are therefore not given."

The PGN sacculus protects the cells against their own internal turgor making PGN one of the most important targets for antibacterial treatment. Within the last sixty years PGN composition has been intensively studied by various methods. The breakthrough was the application of HPLC technology on the analysis of muropeptides. However, preparation of pure PGN relied on a very time consuming method of about one week. We established a purification protocol for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria which can be completely performed in plastic reaction tubes yielding pure muropeptides within 24 hours. The muropeptides can be analyzed by UPLC-MS, allowing their immediate determination. This new rapid method provides the feasibility to screen PGN composition even in high throughput, making it a highly useful tool for basic research as well as for the pharmaceutical industry.",
