            "content": "While over-expression of recombinant proteins in cell cultures is a fairly standard procedure, the purification of such proteins from the cell lysate remains a lengthy and a labor-intensive process. This is especially true of newly discovered proteins for which no standard purification protocols are established. Affinity purification remains the most efficient and high-yielding mode of protein purification, but it is limited by a scarce availability of target-specific affinity ligands <sup>1</sup>.\r\n\n\nThis is complicated by the fact that the development of target-specific affinity ligands, antibodies being the most commonly used type, often requires the availability of the target protein in a pure form.  While the use of genetically fused affinity tags is common in purification of proteins, their use may often introduce unwanted effects, such as changes in target protein conformation, decreased protein expression levels, and toxicity to host cells <sup>2</sup>. Moreover, it is often difficult to efficiently cleave off an affinity tag without affecting the target protein. The need for introduction of affinity tags can be overcome by using target-specific affinity ligands, such as aptamers. Aptamers are short 20-100 nucleotide RNA or DNA molecules that can bind their target molecules with high affinity and specificity. \r\n\n\nAptaPIC is a technique that allows for: \\(1) the development of aptamers for a single protein target in the context of a crude cell lysate; \\(2) and the subsequent use of the developed aptamers in affinity purification of the target protein <sup>3</sup>. This technique was developed to shorten the optimization time for purification of novel protein targets, while achieving high-quality of purification. Figure 1 summarizes the major steps involved in AptaPIC. \r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1654/original/f1.jpg?1291913914\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1654/thumbnail/f1.png?1291913914\" > </a>\r\n\n\n**Figure 1:** Schematic representation of major AptaPIC steps.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTo make the generation of target-specific aptamers possible in the context of a cell lysate, AptaPIC employs the strategy of alternating positive and negative selection steps. In positive selection, the DNA library is exposed to the target-containing cell lysate \\(i.e. the lysate of cells in which the target protein is over-expressed) and the bound fraction of DNA is collected and retained for further processing. This step results in the enrichment of the DNA pool with aptamers for both the target protein and for the non-target components of the cell lysate. To eliminate these non-target-specific aptamers, the step of negative selection is introduced. In this step, the enriched DNA pool obtained in the positive aptamer selection step is exposed to the target-free cell lysate \\(i.e. the lysate of the cells which were transformed with an empty vector), but in contrast to the positive selection step, the non-bound fraction of DNA is collected. The success of aptamer generation through AptaPIC strongly depends on whether the target-containing \\(positive) and the target-free \\(negative) cell lysates meet two conditions. The first condition is that the positive cell lysate contains the target protein in the soluble form at a sufficiently high proportion. We have shown that AptaPIC is effective with over-expression levels of the target protein as low as 5% of total protein in the cell lysate. It is advised, however, that the target protein is to be expressed at levels of 10-30% of total protein in the cell lysate. Thus, for best results it important to select a high-yielding protein expression system, such as E. coli BL21 \\(DE3). The second condition is that the negative cell lysate resembles the positive cell lysate as closely as possible, with the exception of lacking the target protein. As the strategy of alternating positive and negative selection steps will yield aptamers to any components that are differentially expressed between the two cell lysates, it is important to eliminate any differences in expression levels of such components that can arise due to differences in handling. Thus, the best strategy for obtaining the negative cell lysate is to transform the batch of host cells with an empty vector, and to expose them to the same manipulations as the target-expressing cells. This will ensure that components such as antibiotic resistance agents and transcription/translation machinery agents are present in the negative cell lysates at comparable levels to the positive cell lysate. As requirements for protein expression differ from target to target, the procedure for protein expression is not discussed in this protocol. While this protocol focuses on bacterial protein expression, it can be modified to work with other expression systems, as long as the two previously discussed conditions are met.\r\n\n\nIn this protocol we utilize capillary electrophoresis \\(CE) for the separation of bound and non-bound DNA sequences. While other partitioning methods are compatible with AptaPIC, due to its high resolving power, the use of CE significantly decreases the time of aptamer generation while maintaining high stringency <sup>4, 5</sup>. In particular, we use Non-Equilibrium Capillary Electrophoresis of Equilibrium Mixtures \\(NECEEM) mode of CE. In addition to partitioning, NECEEM can also be used to make quantitative measurements of equilibrium and rate constants, allowing for convenient affinity characterization of the obtained aptamer pools <sup>6</sup>. You should be familiar with the basics of NECEEM and capillary electrophoresis before attempting this protocol <sup>5</sup>.\r\n\n\nTo reduce nuclease-facilitated degradation of the DNA ligands and the negative effects of DNA-binding proteins on the efficiency of aptamer generation, AptaPIC uses masking DNA, the sequence of which is chosen such that it cannot be PCR amplified along with the molecules of the DNA library. The choice of the concentration of the masking DNA has a significant effect on the efficiency of AptaPIC. If the chosen concentration of masking DNA is too low, it will cause the saturation of the aptamer pool with non-aptamer sequences that are collected as a result of their non-specific binding to the components of the cell lysate. If the chosen concentration of masking DNA is too high, it will cause the loss of aptamer sequences in the negative selection steps. Masking DNA concentration titration step, described in this protocol, is performed to determine the minimum concentration of the masking DNA that achieves the desired levels of suppression of DNA degradation and non-specific binding. The determined minimum masking DNA concentration should be used in the DNA selection steps.     \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAmplification of heterogeneous pools of DNA through PCR often results in accumulation of disruptive byproducts <sup>7</sup>. Accumulation of these byproducts is dependent on the number of amplification cycles. It is thus important to identify an optimal number of amplification cycles for each pool obtained during AptaPIC. This protocol describes a quantitative PCR-based approach for determination of this optimum. As aptamers are single-stranded DNA ligands, this protocol also includes a step of asymmetric PCR that results in enrichment of the DNA pools with aptamer strands over their complimentary strands.     \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDuring aptamer pool generation steps, some uncertainty will always be present regarding the specificity of the emerging aptamer pools. If the positive and the negative cell lysates are not balanced properly, AptaPIC may produce aptamer pools with high cross-reactivity to non-target components of the cell lysate. As a final evaluation of specificity of the acquired aptamer pool, its ability to isolate the target protein from the cell lysate should be tested. This protocol describes an aptamer-facilitated protein pull-down test that will allow such characterizations to be made. This step should not be viewed as a preparative method. Once an aptamer pool with desired characteristic is obtained, it can be used in high-scale column chromatography procedures <sup>8</sup>."

Set up 40 \u00b5L amplification reaction mixture for the products of amplification reaction from step 28, using the components as described in table 5.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Table 5:** Contents of the asymmetric PCR amplification reaction mixture\r\n\n\n\u2022 10x PCR buffer - **4 \u00b5L**\r\n\n\n\u2022 FAM-Forward primer \\(10 \u00b5M) - **4 \u00b5L \\(to 1 \u00b5M)**\r\n\n\n\u2022 Biotin-Reverse primer \\(10 \u00b5M) - **0.2 \u00b5L \\(to 50 nM)**\r\n\n\n\u2022 dNTPs \\(10 mM) - **0.8 \u00b5L \\(to 200 nM)**\r\n\n\n\u2022 _Taq_ DNA polymerase \\(5 units mL\n-1\n) - **0.4 \u00b5L \\(to 0.05 units mL\n-1\n)**\r\n\n\n\u2022 Template - **2 \u00b5L**\r\n\n\n\u2022 ddH2O - **28.6 \u00b5L**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n31. Amplify the reactions using the PCR program detailed in table 4. There is no need to measure the fluorescence signal from this reaction. Perform 15 amplification cycles.\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Purification of aptamer DNA strands**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n32. Aliquot 20 \u00b5L streptavidin magnetic beads into an empty microcentrifuge tube. Wash the beads twice with 200 \u00b5L BWB. After each wash, remove the beads from the solution with a magnetic bead separator.\r\n  \r\n\n\n33.  Mix 40 \u00b5L of PCR-amplified samples from step 28 with 40 \u00b5L BWB.\r\n  \r\n\n\n34. Resuspend the beads from step 32 in the sample solutions from step 33, and gently mix. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min, gently mixing every five min to facilitate faster binding of DNA to the beads.\r\n  \r\n\n\n35.  Pull down the beads from the solution using a magnetic separator and collect the supernatant. Load the supernatant on to the molecular cut-off filters. Discard the beads.\r\n  \r\n\n\n36. Centrifuge the molecular cut-off filters with the supernatant from step 35, at 7,000 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes at 15\u00b0 C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n37. Load 200 \u00b5L of SB on to the filter and repeat step 36. Wash the filters in this manner three more times. Discard the flow-through as the test tube becomes filled.\r\n  \r\n\n\n38.  Load 15 \u00b5L of SB on to the filter and incubate, without centrifugation, for 30 min at 15\u00b0 C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n39. Place the filter up-side-down into a new clean test tube and centrifuge at 7,000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes at 15\u00b0 C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n40. Collect the eluted fraction and discard the filters. The collected fraction contains the DNA aptamer pool.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**PAUSE POINT** Amplified aptamer pools can be stored at \u201320 \u00b0C for several years.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Approximation of resultant pool concentration**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n41. Prepare the following dilutions of the FAM-Forward primer: 50nM, 200 nM, 500nM and 1 \u00b5M. \r\n  \r\n\n\n42. Perform NECEEM as described in step 9 with each of the dilutions of the FAM-labeled primer. Plot the heights of the produced peaks against primer concentrations to obtain a standard curve. Using the standard curve and the peak height from step 41 roughly approximate the concentration of the aptamer pool. \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Affinity analysis of aptamer pools**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n43. Use temperature treatment, as described in step 6, on 5 \u00b5L of aptamer pool from step 40.\r\n  \r\n\n\n44. Prepare a 5 \u00b5L equilibrium mixture with the following components: 1 \u00b5L of aptamer pool from step 43, 20 \u00b5g mL\n-1\nof positive cell lysate, 100 nM of fluorescein, and the concentration of masking DNAs as used in step 15. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\r\n  \r\n\n\n45.  Use a 50-cm capillary for the following CE run. Rinse the capillary as described in step 5.\r\n  \r\n\n\n46. Inject 50 nL of the equilibrium mixture from step 44 into the capillary and run NECEEM in RB at 375 V cm\n\u20131\n\\(normal polarity and positive electrode at the injection end).\r\n  \r\n\n\n47. Compare the resultant electropherogram to the one produced in step 12. Any peak, or peaks, that increase in area should be suspected to correspond to complexes between the target protein and the DNA aptamers. Using equation 1, calculate the bulk EC\n50\nvalue of the aptamer pool to the target in using the combined areas of the suspected peaks. In equation 1, \\[T]\ntot\nand \\[DNA]\ntot\nare the total concentrations of the target and DNA, respectively; A\n1\nis the area of the peak of free DNA divided by the migration time of free DNA, A\n2\nis the area of the peak of DNA that dissociated from the complex during NECEEM divided by the migration time of free DNA and A\n3\nis the area of the peak of the intact complex that reached the detector divided by the migration time of the complex. EC\n50\nis a measure of an effective abundance of aptamers in the library, which is used for qualitatively monitoring the progress of selection \u2014 a decrease of this value throughout the steps of partitioning indicates that the selection is progressing. The division of areas by corresponding migration times is performed to ensure that peak areas are proportional to the amounts of the species. This procedure is necessary for CE instruments with the on-column detection mode only. For CE instruments with past-column detection, normalization by time is not required. See troubleshooting.\n**Equation 1:** Calculation of the bulk EC\n50\nvalue for an aptamer pool.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PAUSE POINT** Use the data collected from these steps for subsequent rounds at your convenience.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Subsequent aptamer selection rounds** \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n48. Subsequent rounds of aptamer selection should be repeated in the same manner as described above in steps 16 to step 47. Some modifications are as follows: In all steps where the original DNA library is used, it should be substituted with the aptamer pool obtained in the previous round. In all equilibrium mixtures add the DNA aptamer pool to a final concentration of approximately 100-200 nM. To maintain the ratio between aptamer DNA and masking DNA, reduce the concentration of the masking DNAs by 50 times.\r\n  \r\n\n\n49. When the peaks suspected to represent the complex between aptamers and the target protein become distinguishable, narrow down the collection window around these peaks. \r\n  \r\n\n\n50. Repeat aptamer selection rounds until the pool displays the desired EC\n50\nvalue, or until no improvements to are observed for three consecutive rounds. See troubleshooting.\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Aptamer pool biotinylation**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n51.

The aptamer pool should be capable of binding the target with affinity and selectivity sufficient for isolation of the protein from the cell lysate. Expected purity level of the protein after an aptamer pool-facilitated purification step is between 80-99%. Obtained aptamer pools should be amplified by PCR to produce them in required amounts. To increase purification yield, the aptamer pool can be immobilized on resin and used in column chromatography mode. In such a case, depending on the nature of the protein, it can be recovered from a column either by a gradient of NaCl between 0 to 2 M, by a gradient of urea between 0 to 6 M, or by increasing the temperature in the column \\(temperature range should be optimized for each protein target)."

EC~50~ is a measure of an effective abundance of aptamers in the library, which is used for qualitatively monitoring the progress of selection \u2014 a decrease of this value throughout the steps of partitioning indicates that the selection is progressing. The division of areas by corresponding migration times is performed to ensure that peak areas are proportional to the amounts of the species. This procedure is necessary for CE instruments with the on-column detection mode only. For CE instruments with past-column detection, normalization by time is not required.",

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Protein isolation from cell lysate can represent a significant challenge. The most efficient way to purify a protein is through the use of target-specific affinity ligands. Development of such affinity ligands, in most cases requires the availability of the target protein in a pure form. Thus, isolating the protein from the cell lysate requires affinity ligands, while developing affinity ligands requires a pure protein. Aptamer-facilitated Protein Isolation from Cells \\(AptaPIC) resolves this loop problem. AptaPIC is a technique that allows the development of aptamers for a protein in a context of a cell lysate, without any prior purification steps, and the subsequent utilization of the developed aptamers for protein isolation from the cell lysate.",
