Spot test on Stored Serum/Plasma samples (Figure 4).\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plate out 50 \u00b5L of\u00a01:20\u00a0serum/plasma in alternate columns 1,3,5,7,9,11 (add 2.5 \u00b5L sample to 47.5 \u00b5L PBS).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 50 \u00b5L\u00a01:20\u00a0O-ve blood collected in (so that now sample is diluted to 1:40 and red cells at ~1% v/v)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mix and transfer 50/100 \u00b5L to neighbouring columns 2,4,6,8,10,12 for -ve controls.\u00a0The negative control is important because in rare cases, particularly in donors who have received blood transfusions, the sample in principle may contain antibodies to non-ABO or Rhesus D antigens.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 50 \u00b5L IH4-RBD reagent (2 \u00b5g/mL in PBS = 100 ng/well) to Columns 1,3,5,7,9,11\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 50 \u00b5L PBS to columns 2,4,6,8,10,12.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inc 1 hr RT\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tilt for 30 seconds\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Photograph: with mobile phone use the zoom function to obtain a complete field\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Read as Positive = No teardrop, Negative <1:40 = partial teardrop, Neg = complete teardrop.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0Two readers should read the plates independently, and disagreements resolved by taking the lesser reading.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0For each batch of samples set up positive control wells containing 20-100 ng monoclonal antibody CR3022 (as in Finger-Prick test below). This establishes that all of the reagents are working.\n2. Titration of Stored Serum/Plasma Samples.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dilute samples to\u00a01:20\u00a0in 50 \u00b5L PBS (2.5 \u00b5L to 47.5 \u00b5L) in V-bottomed plate in Rows A-H, column 1. Prepare WHO standard serum 20/130 as above at 1:20, or CR3022 50 \u00b5L\u00a0\u00a0at 20 \u00b5g/mL, for calibration for each batch of titrations. WHO standard 20/130 should titrate to ~ 1:1280, and 20 \u00b5g/mL CR3022 to ~ 1:512.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare doubling dilutions with PBS across the plate columns 1-11 (1:40 to 1:40,960), PBS control in column 12. Eight samples can be titrated per 96-well plate.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 50 \u00b5L 1:40 O-ve red cells (1% v/v or 1:40 fresh EDTA O-ve blood sample) to all wells\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 50 \u00b5L IH4-RBD (2 \u00b5g/mL, = 100 ng/well). [Note: the red cells and IH4-RBD can be pre-mixed and added together in either 50 \u00b5L or 100 \u00b5L volume, to save a step. This variation in technique does not alter the measured titres.]\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Allow red cells to settle for 1 hr\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tilt plate for at least 30 s and photograph. The titre is defined by the last well in which the tear drop fails to form. Partial teardrop regarded as negative.\n3. Finger-prick test on capillary blood as a Point of Care Test\nPreparation: Clean Hands, warm digit. Prepare a plate (96-well V-bottomed) labelled with Date and Time.\nPrick skin on outer finger pulp with disposable, single use\u00a0BD or another\u00a0Lancet.\nWipe away first drop\u00a0of blood\u00a0with sterile towel/swab\nMassage second drop\nTake a\u00a0minimum of\u00a05\u00a0\u00b5L\u00a0blood with\u00a020 \u00b5L\u00a0pipette, mix immediately into 20\u00a0\u00b5L\u00a0K2EDTA (3.6 mg/mL/PBS) in Eppendorf. If possible, take 25 \u00b5L of blood and mix into 100 \u00b5L K2EDTA solution. Another approach is collection of blood drops into a BD Microtainer K2E EDTA lavender vials REF 365975 that take 250-500 \u00b5L.\nFor 5 \u00b5L sample dilute to 200\u00a0\u00b5L\u00a0with PBS (add 175\u00a0\u00b5L\u00a0PBS), for 25 \u00b5L sample dilute to 1ml (add 975 \u00b5L PBS).\u00a0Sample\u00a0is\u00a0now at 1:40, and the red cells are at the correct density (~1% v/v assuming a haematocrit of 40%) to give a clear tear drop.\nPlate 50\u00a0\u00b5L\u00a0x 3 in V bottomed microtitre wells labelled T (Test), + (PC, positive Control), - (NC, negative control).\nAdd 10\u00a0\u00b5L\u00a0of control anti RBD Mab CR3022 (2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL stock in PBS, 20 ng/well) to \u201c+\u201c well\nAdd 50\u00a0\u00b5L\u00a0IH4-RBD (2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL in PBS) to \u201cT\u201d (Test) and \u201c+ve\u201c wells, 50 \u00b5L PBS to \u201c-ve\u201c well.\nIncubate 1 hour at RT for Red Cells to form a pellet in the \u201c-ve\u201c well\nTilt plate against a well-lit white background for\u00a0~30 seconds to allow Tear drop to form in \u201c-ve\u201c well.\nThe presence of antibodies to RBD is shown by loss of Tear Drop formation in the \u201cT\u201c and\u00a0\u00a0\u201c+ve\u201c wells.\u00a0Occasionally a partial tear drop forms \u2013 these wells are counted as Negative.\nPhotograph the plate to record\u00a0the\u00a0results with the date and time\n.\u00a0Results can be reviewed and tabulated later.\u00a0Taking picture from a distance and using the zoom function helps to take a clear picture of all wells in a 96-well plate.\nThe negative (PBS) control should be done on every sample for comparison. The Positive control induced by CR3022 is used to check that all the reagents are working, and that the glycophorin epitope recognised by VHH(IH4) is present on the red cells. Absence of the IH4 epitope should be\u00a0very rare\n(Habib et al., 2013)\n.\nFor setting up cohorts a positive control on every sample is therefore not necessary but should be included in every\nbatch\nof samples.\n15.\u00a0\u00a0If a 25 \u00b5L sample of blood was taken from the finger prick there should be 850 \u00b5L of the 1:40 diluted blood left. The red cells can be removed and a preparation of 1:40 O-ve red cells used as above to titrate the sample. In principle the autologous red cells could be washed x3, resuspended in the same volume of PBS, and used as indicators for the titration, however we have not attempted to do this. The supernatant is 1:40 plasma that can be used in confirmatory ELISA or other tests."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Serological detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential for establishing rates of</p><p>seroconversion in populations, and for seeking evidence for a level of antibody that may be</p><p>protective against COVID-19 disease. Several high-performance commercial tests have been</p><p>described, but these require centralised laboratory facilities that are comparatively</p><p>expensive, and therefore not available universally. Red cell agglutination tests do not</p><p>require special equipment, are read by eye, have short development times, low cost and can</p><p>be applied at the Point of Care. We describe a quantitative Haemagglutination test (HAT) for</p><p>the detection of antibodies to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p><p>The HAT has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99% for detection of antibodies after a</p><p>PCR diagnosed infection. We will supply aliquots of the test reagent sufficient for ten</p><p>thousand test wells free of charge to qualified research groups anywhere in the world.</p>",
