This methology has been also successfully applied to human neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing wt human \u03b1-Synuclein as well as to COS-7 cells transiently overexpressing wt and mutant forms of \u03b1-Synuclein. The overall purification is divided in three general steps: An ammonium sulfate preciptation giving a crude protein solution, a bulk purification which can be adjusted to the exact sample properties \\(volume, cell type, cross contamination) utilizing alternatively 3 different methods \\(AX, HIC, covalent chromatography), and a polishing step giving pure protein after size exclusion chromatography \\(Fig. 1).\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1841/thumbnail/Fig_1.png?1310591828\">See figure in Figures section.</a>"

            "content": "**Cell lysis**:\r\n\n\n_Erythrocytes_: \r\n\n\nA. Instead of freshly drawn blood, older samples can be employed. The ratio of \u03b1-Synuclein/Hemoglobin in those samples can be drastically reduced however, making the purification more challenging\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_3D5 cells_:\r\n\n\nA. It has to be made sure that the cell lysate does not heat up too much during sonication. Short sonication steps with incubation of the sample on ice in between are therefore recommended.\r\n\n\nB. In cell culture cell lysates, a 25% \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> pre-precipitation step can be beneficial to remove unwanted protein. If HIC is employed for the bulk purification, this is not necessary since the respective binding buffer already contains approx. 25% \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and thereby eliminates contamination before the column is loaded\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Ammonium sulfate precipitation**:\r\n\n\nIn erythrocyte lysate, washing the 50% \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> pellet in 55% \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution is highly recommended. Since Hemoglobin stays soluble until 60-65% \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the washing steps provide a cheap and easy method to eliminate large amounts of contaminating Hemoglobin.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Bulk purification**\r\n\n\nThe exact method of bulk purification has to be decided by the nature of the sample. In general, the HIC gave the highest purity but lowest yield. If high trough-put is needed, the Sepharose 6B method should be applied. If large amounts of Hemoglobin are present, AX is recommended. If a particular sample has low purity with one of the chosen methods, an additional step utilizing one of the other methods can be employed.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA: HIC advantages: Fast, cheap, best purity,  \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in binding/elution buffer stabilizes folding. Disadvantages: Low binding capacity, struggles with high amounts of contaminating Hemoglobin. Results can be inconsistent depending on the exact sample. Has sometimes to be applied twice to effectively purifiy all \u03b1-Synuclein out of solution.\r\n\n\nB: AX advantages: Fast, cheap, good binding affinity, Hemoglobin does not bind \\(making it very effective in separating \u03b1-Synuclein and Hemoglobin). Disadvantages: High amounts of NaCl in elution buffer can destabilize \u03b1-Synuclein, causing it to precipitate. Transthyretin and \u03b1-Synuclein elute very close to each other making thorough removal of blood plasma prior to erythrocyte lysing necessary. Has sometimes to be applied twice to effectively purifiy all \u03b1-Synuclein out of solution.\r\n\n\nC: Instead of Sepharose 6B gel medium, Sepharose 4B can be used. Sepharose 6B has shown to have a better binding capacity, while Sepharose 4B packed columns can be easier reactivated. \r\n\n\nSepharose 6B advantages: Simple and consistent, good for large sample volumes, high yield, removes both Transthyretin and Hemoglobin from erythrocyte lysate samples very effectively. Since no high pressures/high flow rates, no buffer gradient and no monitoring of UV-absorption or conductivity are needed, it can be done with a simple peristaltic pump. Disadvantages: Expensive gel media, no pre-packed columns commercially available, regeneration of column time consuming. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Size Exclusion Chromatography \\(Superdex 200)**:\r\n\n\nInstead of a Superdex 200 column, Superdex 75, Superose 12 and Sephacryl 200-HR were also successfully employed. The advantage of the Superdex 200 gel medium is the ability to separate Hemoglobin from \u03b1-Synuclein in contrast to the above mentioned media."
