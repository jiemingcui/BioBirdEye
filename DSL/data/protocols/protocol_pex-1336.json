            "content": "<p>For the past decade, RNA sequencing has progressively become the gold-standard approach in genome-wide transcriptional profiling. Experimental design has to balance between sufficient numbers of sample measurements and economical cost. Hence, compromising between the number of tested conditions and the number of replicates tends to limit statistical power. Increasing costs are mainly due to limited throughput in library preparation and higher read depth, the latter being required in particular for transcript reconstruction and allele-specific expression analysis. In this context, improving the throughput of library preparation while optimizing sequencing depth would allow accurate analysis of large sample groups at reasonable cost.</p><p>We have implemented in our core facility the 3\u2032-digital gene expression (3\u2032-DGE) approach developed by the Broad institute<sup>1,2</sup>, based on multiplexing samples and molecular indexing of mRNA molecules. We have in particular improved the fragmentation step by implementing tagmentation based on the activity of a bead-linked transposome. This technique is named 3\u2019SRP for 3\u2019 sequencing RNA Profiling (Fig.1).</p><p><br></p><p>3\u2019SRP relies on transcript barcoding with unique molecule identifiers (UMI). As reads reporting the same gene and UMI are filtered, this strategy removes the duplicate reads, which result from multiple counts of the same DNA fragment after the PCR amplification step. Another advantage of 3\u2019SRP is that only 5 million&nbsp;reads are required for transcriptome profiling, while full-length RNA&nbsp;sequencing&nbsp;(RNAseq) usually requires 50 million&nbsp;reads.</p><p>This technique allows sample multiplexing on 96-well plates. Libraries are then sequenced using standard procedures, e.g. on Hiseq2500 or NovaSeq 6000 SP Flow Cells. High multiplexing considerably reduces the cost of sequencing per sample.</p><p>Regarding data analysis, standard RNAseq tools can be used with some adjustments related to UMI counting. To facilitate data processing in service-oriented settings, we have modified the de-multiplexing step to obtain one fastq and one bam file per sample. This allows us to handle several projects on the same run. This file splitting step also reduces the computation time by using the parallelization power of a HPC cluster. We have also adapted the code to allow for large projects split over several runs. We have developed a <a href=\"https://bio.tools/3SRP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">snakemake<sup>8 </sup>pipeline</a> including every analysis step from raw fastq de-multiplexing to functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes, producing a complete HTML report for end-user.</p>"

            "content": "Experimental design\nA clear definition of the scientific question driving genome-wide transcriptional profiling remains the key factor to determine the optimal experimental design.\nA crucial point is the specification of the number of biological replicates to ensure sufficient statistical power. The optimal number of replicates depends mainly on the magnitude of differential expression (effect size) and the complexity of experimental design (number of covariates). However, as described in Alpern et al. article\n9\n, shifting from 20 to 5 replicates greatly reduces the ability to detect true differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (decrease statistical power). The low cost per sample is a great advantage for increasing the number of samples in an analysis and allows a high performance to detect DEGs.\nIn order to avoid batch effects, RNA extraction series have to be randomized according to biological conditions. A randomization of the samples on micro-well plates is also necessary to avoid rows/columns batch effects; we have developed an\nalgorithm to randomize samples\n.\nSample qualification\nLibraries are prepared from 10ng of total RNA per sample, diluted in 4\u00b5l of RNase free water. RNA concentration and purity are measured on NanoDrop station (ThermoFisher scientific); OD 260/230 ratios should be around 1.8 - 2.0 to ensure that concentration is properly assessed. Quality of RNA samples is controlled on 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent) with RNA 6000 Nano Kit (ref 5067-1511, Agilent).\nLibrary preparation\nLibrary construction (Fig.2) for 3\u2019SRP is performed according to Soumillon\u00a0et al.\n1\nThe mRNA poly(A) tails are tagged with universal adapters, well-specific barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) during template-switching reverse\u00a0transcription: 96 RNA samples are distributed in a MicroAmp Optical 96-well Reaction Plate (ref N8010560, Applied Biosystems) with 1\u00b5l of\u00a0well-specific barcoded adapter E3V6NEXT (10\u00b5M, Integrated DNA Technologies) .\nE3V6NEXT = 5'-/5Biosg/ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT[BC6]N10T30VN-3'\n5Biosg = 5\u2019 biotin,\n[BC6] = 6bp barcode specific to each cell/well,\nN10 = Unique Molecular Identifiers\nTemplate-switching reverse transcription was performed using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (ref EP0753, Life technologies), Deoxynucleotide (dNTP) Solution Mix (ref N0447L, New England Biolabs) and with universal adapter E5V6NEXT (100\u00b5M, Integrated DNA Technologies).

Pooled and concentrated cDNAs are treated with Exonuclease I (M0293S/L, New England Biolabs) and then amplified by single primer PCR using Advantage\u00ae 2 PCR Kit (ref 639206, Ozyme) and SINGV6 primer (10\u00b5M, Integrated DNA Technologies) :\nSINGV6 = 5\u2019-/5Biosg/ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACG*C-3\u2019\n12 cycles of PCR amplification are applied. PCR products are purified with Agencourt\u00a0AMPure XP magnetics beads [0.6x] (ref A63881, Beckman Coulter) and quantified spefically for dbDNA on Varioskan\u2122 LUX (ThermoFisher scientific) with QUANT-IT dsDNA assay kit (ref Q33130, ThermoFisher scientific).\nTagmentation has been adapted from the original protocol. Amplified barcoded cDNAs are tagmented using a bead-linked transposome (Illumina). Between 100 and 200ng of full-length cDNAs was used as input to the Nextera\u2122 DNA Flex Library Prep kit (ref #20018704, Illumina) and Nextera\u2122 DNA CD Indexes (24 Indexes, 24 Samples) (ref #20018707, Illumina) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Nextera DNA Flex Library Document, ref #1000000025416 v04, Illumina) with exception that :\n- the i5 primer was replaced by P5NEXTPT5 primer (5\u00b5M, Integrated DNA Technologies)\nP5NEXTPT5 = 5\u2019-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCC*G*A*T*C*T*-3\u2019\nwhere * = phosphorothioate bonds\n- number of PCR cycles was defined at 8\n- final elution of purified library was realized in 15\u00b5l of RSB (Resuspension Buffer - included Nextera\u2122 DNA Flex Library Prep kit, Illumina)\nLibrary quantification\nThe size of the resulting sequencing library was controlled on a 2200 Tape Station (Agilent) with High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape (ref 5067- 5584, Agilent) and High Sensitivity D1000 Reagents (ref 5067- 5585, Agilent). Expected size of library is between 400 and 800pb.\nLibrary is specifically P5-P7 quantified by qPCR on Light Cycler 480 (Roche) according to standards Lib Quant Standards (Illumina) (ref 07960387001, Roche). P5 and P7 primers (100\u00b5M, Eurofins) are added to Master Mix of kit Kapa\u00a0Sybr Fast LC480 (ref KK4611, Sigma-Aldrich).\nP5 = 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGAT-3'\nP7 = 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA-3'\nThe final concentration must be greater than 2nM in 10\u00b5l (for HiSeq sequencing) or greater than 15nM in 10\u00b5l (for NovaSeq sequencing) to be sequenced.\nSequencing\nLibraries are sequenced either on an Illumina\u00a0HiSeq 2500 using a Hiseq Rapid SBS Kit v2-50 cycles (ref FC-402-4022) and a Hiseq Rapid PE Cluster Kit v2 (ref PE-402-4002) with 16-58 cycles reads according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Denaturing and Diluting Libraries for the HiSeq\u00ae and GAIIx, Part # 15050107v03, Illumina), or on a NovaSeq 6000 using NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent Kit 100 cycles (ref #20027464, Illumina) with 17-8-105 cycles reads (Illumina recommends to add one cycle for reads 1 and 3 on NovaSeq sequencing) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System Guide Document #1000000019358v11 Material #20023471, Illumina). i7 indexes are read on NovaSeq sequencing due to injection of two plates of 96 libraries on a SP Flow Cell.\nRaw fastq pairs used for analysis matched the following criteria:\n- the 16 bases of the first read (forward reads) correspond to 6 bases for a designed well-specific barcode and 10 bases for a unique molecular identifier (UMI).\n- the second read (reverse reads), 104 bases for NovaSeq (58 bases for HiSeq runs), corresponds to the captured poly(A) RNAs sequence.\nBioinformatics analysis (Fig.1) can be divided in three parts: 1) primary analysis which includes demultiplexing, alignment and counting steps; 2) secondary analysis that performs the differential analysis; 3) tertiary analysis which is focused on the functional annotation and the representation of differentially expressed genes.\nPrimary Analysis\nThe primary analysis (Fig.3) consist in generating the expression matrix containing the raw counts for each sample and for each gene, from raw sequencing data files.\n- Illumina\u00a0basecall files are transformed into paired-end fastq files with Illumina bcl2fastq converter.\n- Samples are demultiplexed according to their respective barcodes described in a sample sheet to create a single-end fastq file per sample.\n- A step of read trimming is performed in order to remove any poly A tail, which can occur when the transposase cuts a DNA fragment in close proximity to the poly A tail. By using cutadapt on these fragments, all the bases following the poly A tails (reverse sequences of the UMI, sample barcode and illumina adapter) are also removed.\n- The cDNA sequences from each sample are then aligned on the reference transcriptome and the mitochondrial genomic reference sequence with BWA\n5\naligner. Since a reference transcriptome is used, there is no need for RNA aligner (such as STAR or bowtie).\n- Expression profiles are generated by parsing the alignment files (bam) then counting the number of unique UMIs associated with each gene for each sample.\n- Reads are removed if one of the following cases occur:\n* the UMI contains 'N's in its sequence.\n* there are more than 3 mismatches in the alignment.\n* the sequence aligns with the same score on transcripts of more that one gene.\n- Finally, the raw expression matrix is produced, which contains the values of abundance for every gene in all samples.\nSecondary Analysis\nThe secondary analysis consists in identifying the differentially expressed genes between conditions from the raw expression matrix.\nThe pipeline is mainly written in the R programming language.\n- Samples and genes are filtered out of the raw expression matrix according to the parameters specified in the configuration file:\n* Samples are removed if they have less than --minReads reads assigned (default 200k) or if they have less than --minGenes genes detected (i.e. number of genes with at least 1 count) (default 5k).\n* Genes are removed if not detected (counts = 0) in at least the number of samples forming the smallest condition.\n- Counts are then normalized by DESeq2\n6\nmethod.\n- Differentially expressed genes are found by DESeq2. By default, genes with an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and a log2 fold-change > 0.58 (i.e. fold-change > 1.5) are defined as differentially expressed.\nTertiary Analysis\nUsing ClusterProfiler\n10\nand StringDB\n8\ntools provides some hints on the interpretation of the differentially expressed genes.\n- Enrichment tests are performed on Gene Ontology annotations and KEGG pathways.\n- GSEA analysis\n- StringDB networks are shown if the number of differentially expressed genes is below 50.\nRunning the 3\u2019SRP pipeline\nThe pipeline is entirely implemented as a\nSnakemake workflow\n. Scripts used in the pipeline are mainly written in the python and R programming language.\nRequirements\nInstalling git and conda are mandatory before running the pipeline.\nAll necessary tools are then listed within a conda environment recipe. This environment can be created with a basic conda command.\n-----\n$ conda\u00a0env create -n srp -f CONDA/srp.yml\n-----\nTesting the installation\nA minimal sample size test data as well as a sample\u00a0sheet are available in the \"TESTDATA\" folder. In order to check the installation, run the pipeline on this data.\nThis test data is made up of six samples classified in three conditions (2 samples per condition). The fastq files are real reads taken on a small portion of the human chromosome 22. The reference is a fasta file of the human chromosome 22.\n-----\n$\u00a0conda activate srp\n# Under the srp-pipeline directory:\n$ python SCRIPTS/make_srp_config.py -s TESTDATA/samplesheet.tsv -r TESTDATA/REFERENCES/ -w RESULTS -f TESTDATA/fastqFiles.txt -c TESTDATA/conditions.tsv --minGenes 0 --minReads 0 > config.json\n$ snakemake --config\u00a0conf=\"config.json\" -rp -j 1\n-----\nInput files\nThe pipeline takes as input a samplesheet describing samples, one or multiple pairs of fastq files and eventually a file listing the comparisons to test.\n--The samplesheet :\nA samplesheet describing the samples is necessary to run the pipeline. This file has to be tab delimited (without header) containing six columns: well, index, name, project, condition, species.\n--The fastq\u00a0files :\nThe fastq files have to be in paired-end mode. The first file should contain the sequences of the sample indexes as well as the unique molecule identifiers (UMI) (6+10 bases). The second file should contain the DNA sequences of the captured polyA RNAs (N bases). There are two ways of specifying the fastq files to the program:\n- Creating a file listing the fastq paths\n- Specifying a Illumina directory (bcl2fastq output folder)\n--The comparisons file :\nIn order to perform secondary analysis for all or some projects, a file listing the project name and comparisons has to be create.\nRunning the pipeline\n1- Clone this repository and move to it\n-----\n$ git\u00a0clone \"https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/bird_pipeline_registry/srp-pipeline.git\"\n$ cd srp-pipeline\n-----\n2- Activate the conda environment\n----\n$ conda activate srp\n----\n3- Create the configuration file necessary for the pipeline.\nThe script used to create the configuration file is make_srp_config.py in the SCRIPTS folder. The help can be visualized with:\n----\n$ python SCRIPTS/make_srp_config.py -h\n----\nThe mandatory options are\n-s for the samplesheet\n, either\n-f for a file\nlisting the fastq paths or\n-i for an illumina directory\nand\n-r for the directory containing the genome files\nfor the different assemblies.\nIt is recommended to specify a working directory where the files will be\noutput with option -w\nto keep the srp-pipeline git clone clean. The program outputs a json object on stdout which can be redirected to a file.\n----\n$ python SCRIPTS/make_srp_config.py -s\n-r\n-w\n-i\n> config.json\n----\nFor secondary analysis, use\noption -c\nto specify the comparisons to perform.\n----\n$ python SCRIPTS/make_srp_config.py -s\n-r\n-w\n-i\n-c\n> config.json\n----\nThe generated configuration file should be checked to see if everything seems alright.\n----\n$ cat\u00a0config.json\n----\n4- Launch the snakemake pipeline.\nTest the launch with a\ndry run\n:\n----\n$ snakemake --config\u00a0conf=\"config.json\" -rpn\n----\nAll rules and commands that will be run should be displayed. Otherwise errors are returned.\nLaunch the run:\n----\n$ snakemake --config\u00a0conf=\"config.json\" -rp -j 1\n----\nIn order to launch the pipeline\non a cluster\n, specify a script to encapsulate the jobs to snakemake. example for SGE:\n----\n$ snakemake --config\u00a0conf=\"config.json\" --cluster \"qsub -e ./logs/ -o ./logs/\" -j 33 --jobscript SCRIPTS/sge.sh --latency-wait 100 -rp\n----"

The folder is composed of the following files:</p><p>- filtered, normalized and log-transformed matrices.</p><p>- UMIs per million matrix</p><p>- sample correlation heatmap</p><p>- principal component analysis</p><p>- one folder per comparison containing:</p><p>* the DESeq2 differential expression output files</p><p>* a MA and Volcano plots</p><p>* the GO, KEGG and STRINGDB enrichment result files</p><p>* the GSEA result files</p><p>* a&nbsp;heatmap of the DEG.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Report</u></strong></p><p>The pipeline generates a HTML report using JavaScript/jinja/python technologies. This report, intended for end-users, displays project summary, raw and processed data quality controls and differential analysis results (PCA, differential expressed genes, sample clustering...)</p><p>The first&nbsp;part of the report presents the primary analysis: Samples and QC summary, visualization of samples variability. Graphs display the number of total sequences, the read distribution and the number of gene detected (Fig.5A). The HTML report embeds the MultiQC<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;report. All FastQC reports are summarized in one report, containing quality scores, GC and adapter content, overrepresented sequences<em>. </em>The samples variability is shown by a reduction dimension graph (PCA) and a sample clustering (Fig.5B,C).</p><p><br></p><p>For each comparison, as described in the config file, Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) are visualized by a table (over/under expressed), a MA-plot, a vulcano plot and a clustering of genes (Fig.6).</p><p>The DEGs can be displayed dynamically or the full table of DESeq2 results can be downloaded. The available data table is as follow: Gene symbol; base Mean (mean counts of all samples in the project); Log FC (fold-change log transformed); stat (value of DESeq2 statistical test); pvalue; padj (ajusted&nbsp;pvalue by BH method); meanInComp (mean counts of the selected sample in the comparison).</p><p><br></p><p>Besides, an analysis with <a href=\"https://string-db.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">STRING</a> is performed. STRING is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations. The proteins network from STRING depicts how genes, through their proteins, interacts together according to the following evidence sources: Neighborhood in the Genome, Gene Fusions, Co-occurrence Across Genomes, Co-Expression, Experimental/Biochemical Data, Association in Curated Databases, Co-Mentioned in PubMed Abstracts.</p><p>The network is displayed in the report, and user can open the interactive view and explore protein interactions (Fig.7B). STRING's list of functional annotation on over-represented and under-represented genes gives another insight from several sources. An interactive table allows to explore each term showing description, statistics, and the list of the under or over-expressed genes matching this term (Fig.7C).</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>3\u2019seq-RNA Profiling (3\u2019SRP) approach is based on multiplexing samples and molecular indexing mRNA in order to drive&nbsp;genome-wide transcriptional profiling at reasonable cost in comparison to standard RNA-sequencing. The protocol is performed according to the 3\u2032-digital gene expression (3\u2032-DGE) approach developed by the Broad institute. The libraries are prepared from small amounts of total RNA where the mRNA poly(A) tails are tagged with universal adapters, well-specific barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).&nbsp;We have improved the fragmentation step by implementing tagmentation based on the activity of a bead-linked transposome. This technique allows sample multiplexing on 96-well plates. Libraries are then sequenced using standard procedures, e.g. on Hiseq2500 or NovaSeq 6000 SP Flow Cells. We have developed a snakemake pipeline including every analysis step from raw fastq de-multiplexing to functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes, producing a complete HTML report for end-user.</p>",
