            "content": "Stroke is an important public health problem leading to high rates of death and disability in adults\\[1-2] Excessive stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors \\(NMDARs) and consequential neuronal nitric oxide synthase \\(nNOS) activation are critical for neuronal injury after stroke insult\\[3-7]. However, directly inhibiting NMDARs or nNOS can cause severe side effects because they have important physiological functions in the CNS\\[5, 8-12].\r\n\n\n    Postsynaptic density 95 \\(PSD95) is a scaffolding protein that binds both NMDARs and nNOS at excitatory synapses and assembles them into a macromolecular signaling complex\\[13-14]. Activation of nNOS depends on its association with PSD95 and NMDARs-mediated calcium influx \\[6]. Disrupt the nNOS\u2013PSD95 interaction could selectively inhibit the NMDARS\u2013PSD95\u2013nNOS signalling pathway, without blocking NMDARs function and catalytic activity of nNOS, thereby sparing unwanted effects on many other important physiological processes mediated by the NMDARs and nNOS\\[13-14]. \r\n\n\nIn this paper, 4-\\(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid \\(1), a nNOS-PSD95 interrupter, and its derivatives \\(Table 1) were synthesized. We prepared compound 1 by condensation of 3,5-dichlorosalicylaldehyde and 4-aminosalicylic acid, and reduction of the condensation production with sodium borohydride. The derivatives of compound 1, compounds 2-7, were synthesized by similar means \\(Fig 1).  Compound 8, methyl 4-\\(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoate was prepared by esterification of 4-\\(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid with methanol \\(Fig 2). Compound 9, 4-\\(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxyphenethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid was prepared by condensation of  2-chloro-1-\\(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethanone and 4-aminosalicylic acid, and reduction of the condensation product with zinc powder \\(Fig 3). Compound 10, 4-\\(3-\\(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)propylamino)-2-hydroxylbenzoicacid, was prepared by condensation of 3-\\(3,5-dichloro-2-methoxyphenyl) acrylaldehyde and 4-aminosalicylic acid, reduction of the condensation product with sodium borohydride, and then hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of 5% Pt/C, removal the methyl in the R1 with boron tribromide \\(Fig 4 )."

In this protocol, 4-\\(3,5-Dichloro-2-hydroxybenzylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, a nNOS-PSD95 interrupter, we named it ZL006, was prepared by the condensation of 3,5-dichlorosalicylaldehyde and 4-aminosalicylic acid, and the reduction of the condensation production with sodium borohydride. We synthesized the derivatives of ZL006 also.",
