            "content": "Resetting the somatic epigenome to a pluripotent state has been achieved by several approaches, including somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell fusion, and overexpression of defined transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc \\(OSKM, also known as the Yamanaka factors) \\(1). The induced pluripotent stem cells \\(iPS cells) derived by overexpression of the OSKM factors have opened up new opportunities for disease modeling and cell therapy applications \\(2,3). However, the low efficiency of iPS cell derivation \\(0.1\u20131 %) \\(3, 4) has hindered these opportunities \\(5). Therefore, creating an efficient and rapid system to convert somatic cells into pluripotent cells would be beneficial for the generation of high-quality iPS cells suitable for cell therapy and also for the full understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the reprogramming process. Here we report a method with which primary pre-B cell precursors derived from the bone marrow of the reprogrammable mouse \\(6) can be converted rapidly and efficiently into iPS cells. The method consists in the transient expression of the transcription factor C/EBP\u03b1 followed by OSKM induction in a serum-free medium. This system allows the derivation of iPS cells within 1 week at very high efficiency. Pluripotency genes are activated as early as 1 day after OSKM induction and transgene- independent colonies are generated within 4 days. The method described here should help to fully understand the reprogramming mechanism of somatic cells into pluripotent cells and could be beneficial for the generation of high-quality iPS cells suitable for disease modeling and cell therapy."

Sacrifice two 8-16 week old reprogrammable mice/Oct4GFP mice by ventilating them with CO\n2\n.\r\n  2. Aseptically remove femurs and tibiae.\r\n  3. Use scissors to remove all tissues from the bones.\r\n  4. Crush the bones in a mortar in 10 ml of labeling buffer.\r\n  5. Thoroughly resuspend the cells by pipetting them up and down.\r\n  6. Filter the cells with a 40\u03bcm cell strainer in a 50 ml conical tube. \r\n  7. Centrifuge the cells for 5 minutes at 300xg, resuspend them in fresh labeling buffer and count them in a hemocytometer.\r\n  8. Resuspend the cells in labeling buffer to a final concentration of 10X10\n6\ncells/ml.\r\n  9. Add Fc-block to the cell suspension at a concentration of 0.1\u03bcg/10\n6\ncells and incubate for 10 minutes on ice.\r\n  10. Add CD19-biotin conjugated antibody \\(0.2ug/10\n6\ncells) and incubate for 20 minutes on ice.\r\n  11. Wash the cells with 10ml of labeling buffer, centrifuge for 5 minutes at 300xg. Resuspend them in 90\u03bcl of labeling buffer and 10\u03bcl of Streptavidin beads per 10 x10\n6\ncells and incubate for 20 minutes on ice.\r\n  12. Wash the cells with 10ml of labeling buffer and proceed with purification using the MACS LS column.\r\n  13. Place the LS column in the MACS separator.\r\n  14. Wash the column with labeling buffer.\r\n  15. Pipette 500\u03bcl of cells in the LS column allowing the suspension to run through and collect the effluent as negative fraction \\(this fraction is enriched for myeloid progenitors).\r\n  16. Wash the column with 3ml of labeling buffer.\r\n  17 Repeat STEP 17 three times.\r\n\n\n18. Remove the column from the MACS separator and place it in a new 15ml collection tube.\r\n  19. Apply 5ml of labeling buffer and firmly flush out the cells using the plunger provided. This yields the CD19 positive B cell fraction.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Reprogramming of Bells**\r\n\n\n_Retrovirus Production and B Cell Infection_\r\n\n\n1. Two days before viral transduction seed 9x10\n6\nPlatE cells \\(Cell Biolabs) into two 10cm dishes. To detach PlatE cells wash the cells once with PBS and then add 1-3ml of TrypLE select cell dissociation reagent. After 3-5 minutes at 37\u00b0C add PlatE medium and count the cells in the hemocytometer.\r\n  2. The following morning transfect PlatE cells with 20\u03bcg of C/EBP\uf061-ER-hCD4 plasmid using the calcium phosphate protocol. \r\n  3. Replace the transfection medium after 8 hours with 6 ml of fresh B cell medium per 10cm plate. Culture the cells at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator.\r\n  4. After 18-20 hours of culture at 37\u00b0C collect the supernatant, filter it using a 0.45\u03bcm sterile filter, add 10ng/ml of IL-7 and use the filtered medium to infect the B cells. Use 2ml of supernatant to infect 2X10\n6\nB cells per well of a 6-weel plate. Add 6 ml of fresh B cell medium to the PlatE cells. Place the cells in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator.\r\n  5. 24 hours later collect the supernatant of the PlatE cells and use it to infect the B cells a second time.\r\n  \r\n\n\n_Plating of B cells on S17 Stromal Cells_\r\n\n\nWe use S17 stromal cells for the first days of B cell expansion before the reprogramming is initiated. \r\n\n\n1. The day of the viral transduction experiment prepare gelatin-coated dishes. Then plate Mitomycin C inactivated S17 cells at a density of 3X10\n4\ncells/cm\n2\nonto 10cm plates. To detach S17 cells, wash the cells with PBS and add the adequate amount of TrypLE select cell dissociation reagent to the cells. After 3-5 minutes, add S17 medium and count the cells in the hemocytometer.\r\n  2. Collect the infected B cells from the 6 well plate and centrifuge them at 300xg for 5 min. Then aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 10 ml of B cell medium. Plate the B cells on the inactivated S17 cells. \r\n  3. Grow the cells 4 days or until they reach confluence \\(note that besides B cells that remain non-adherent, many of them move under the feeders, forming clusters of flattened cells with smooth edges that can easily be distinguished from the feeder cells).\r\n  4. Collect the B cells, stain them with human CD4 antibody and sort hCD4\n+\ntransgene containing cells using a MACS column or a fluorescence activated cell sorter.\r\n  5. The day before the sorting prepare gelatin-coated 12 well dishes. Plate Mitomycin C inactivated MEF cells at a density of 3X10\n4\ncells/cm\n2\n. To detach MEF cells add the adequate amount of TrypLE select cell dissociation reagent. After 3-5 minutes, add S17/MEF medium and count the cells in the hemocytometer.\r\n  6. After the sorting of the hCD4\n+\nB cells, count the cells using the desired method and seed the cells on MEF feeders at a density of 25.000 cells/cm\n2\n. Let the cells grow for two days.\r\n  7. To activate C/EBPa add \u03b2-estradiol at a concentration of 100nM to the B cell medium.\r\n  8. After 18h collect the supernatant and carefully wash the cultures twice with 500\u03bcl of PBS. Then centrifuge the supernatant/PBS at 300xg for 5 min.\r\n  9. Resuspend the pellet in fresh reprogramming medium containing 2ug/ml of doxycycline and re-seed the cells into the original wells. \r\n  10. Gently replace the medium every two days. \r\n  11. Starting at day 1 Oct4GFP positive cells can be observed under a fluorescence microscope or recorded by FACS.\r\n  12. After 2 days supplement the reprogramming medium with 20%KSR, 3uM CHIR99021 and 1uM PD0325901.\r\n  13. Starting at day 4 Oct4GFP positive colonies with ES-like morphology appear. \r\n  13. At day 8 change the medium to reprogramming medium without doxycycline to select transgene-independent iPS cell colonies."

Wash the bones carefully with PBS to avoid possible contamination with cells outside the bones.\r\n  3. We suggest to use T\u00fcrk\u2019s solution to count the cells at this step as the erythrocytes are hemolyzed by the acetic acid and the leukocytes are stained by the dye the solution contains.\r\n  4. The use of FC-block is suggested to avoid unspecific staining with the CD19 primary antibody.\r\n  5. We add 30\u03bcM Cloroquine to the medium used to transfect the PlatE cells to increase transfection efficiency.\r\n  6. We suggest infecting the B cells immediately after the CD19 purification.\r\n  7. We observed increased viability if 1 ml of fresh medium is added to the cells after infection. We do not recommend \"freeze-thawing\" the virus samples since the titers decrease upon thawing. \r\n  8. We initially culture the B cells on S17 stromal cells to increase the number of cells as the proliferation is greatly enhanced in this condition compared to the MEF feeder cells. \r\n  9. The hCD4 cell sorting is performed as for the CD19 biotin.\r\n  10. Maintaining the precise \u03b2\uf062-estradiol exposure time of 18 hours is crucial to obtain an optimal reprogramming efficiency.\r\n  11.
