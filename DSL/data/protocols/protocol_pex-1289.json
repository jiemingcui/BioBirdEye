Seal the plates well with adhesive foil and store them at room temperature for up to one day.\n(!) Do not store the plates for prolonged periods to avoid lysis evaporation.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using large nozzle size (100\u03bc) and single-cell purity mode, sort a single-cell of interest into each well of the PCR plate.\n(!) Before sorting the population of interest, test the correct aiming of the machine. First sort 10-20 cells per well into few wells located on top and bottom of a sealed with transparent seal PCR plate. The droplets should be visible on the seal surface. Then sort 10-20 cells per well into few wells located on top and bottom of an empty PCR plate. The liquid droplet should be visible at the bottom of the PCR plate. Do not use smaller than 100\u03bc nozzle to avoid unnecessary cell stress. The use of FACS for single-cell isolation allows for index sorting. Nevertheless, be conservative on the surface markers used for staining to avoid inducing gene expression changes.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immediately after sorting, seal the plate with\nadhesive foil\n, spin it down for 30 seconds at 1000 rcf and snap-freeze it with dry ice.

Cover the plate to prevent contamination from dust and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.\n(!) Cover the plate in a way to avoid contact between the plate and the cover. Potential contact can lead to cross-contamination. For example, the bottom of a big enough kitchen box can be used. Cover the plate whenever possible in the subsequent steps.

Do not allow to beads to dry and cracks to appear in the bead ring. If the magnetic stand has opposing magnetic sides (as with Thermo Fisher AM10027), you might consider resuspending four but not eight wells at a time. Magnetic stands with non-opposing magnetic sides (such as DynaMag, Thermo Fisher 12027) are easier to process.\n21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using a multichannel pipette, add 1,2 \u03bcl of the respective barcoded primer from the stock 14 \u00b5M tSCRB Barcoded Oligo-dT Primer Plate v3 (corresponds to reverse transcription component 2; final reaction concentration 2,4 \u00b5M) to each well of the single-cell plate and mix.\n(!) From now on, keep the plates on ice unless indicated otherwise.\n(!) Before removing the transparent seal from the stock primer plate, spin the plate for 30 seconds at 1000 rcf to collect the liquid at the bottom of the wells. Be extremely careful when removing the transparent seal to avoid primer cross-contamination. In general, do not aliquot stock plates with primer for more than 20 single-cell plates. Immediately after use, reseal well the plate with transparent seal.\n22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seal the single-cell plate with adhesive foil.

The number of cycles depends on the biology of the cells used. For example, na\u00efve T cells normally require 20 cycles, while activated T cells require 18 cycles. If different timepoints are to be compared, it is best to affix the cycles to the highest necessary number. This should not affect the performance due to the use of unique molecular identifiers, which eliminate the introduction of anPCR bias. Following this incubation, there is a potential stopping point.
