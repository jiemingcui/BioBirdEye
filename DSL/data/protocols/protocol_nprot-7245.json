            "content": "The growing interest in PARP inhibitors \\(PARPi) for the treatment of cancer calls for the development of unbiased approaches to measure PARPi-mediated toxicity.  Current methodology to evaluate PARPi toxicity involves cell proliferation and clonogenic survival assays, manual evaluation of PARPi-induced DNA damage markers such as \u03b3H2AX or RAD51 foci formation in relatively small cohorts of cells, or biochemical cell fractionation for the detection of chromatin-bound PARP enzymes. Although very useful, these approaches are either time consuming, have limited sensitivity, are not well suited for screening purposes, or focus on single parameters of the cellular response to PARPi. Moreover, cell-to-cell variation in PARPi responses, including cell cycle phase-specific responses, is neglected when using methods that measure cell population averages of asynchronously growing cells. Here, we apply an experimental pipeline, which, based on automated microscopy and software-assisted image analysis, allows for image-based cell cycle staging, thus revealing genotoxic stress responses in a sensitive and cell cycle resolved manner \\(1-9). Applied to PARPi, this approach reveals PARPi-induced DNA damage signaling in S-phase cells, quantitatively differentiates responses to different clinically relevant PARPi, measures chromatin retention of PARP enzymes, and may be applied to predict conditions of PARPi hypersensitivity and resistance. In comparison to flow cytometry, the presented workflow combines the advantages of analyzing thousands of individual cells per condition with the high resolution of state-of-the-art microscope lenses, which enables quantification of PARPi-induced changes also at the subcellular level. Although the presented workflow follows the principles of high-content imaging applied in large-scale perturbations screens \\(10,11), it is equally suited for hypothesis driven small-scale experiments and can be applied to address a variety of biological questions in the area PARP inhibitor biology and beyond."

            "content": "Protocol Part A: Indirect immunofluorescence\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Seed cells onto sterilized 12mm coverslips placed in 60-mm dishes in DMEM-GlutaMAX medium complemented with 10 % \\(vol/vol) FCS \\(optional: 1 % penicillin/streptomycin), let them attach and grow for 24 hours at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Alternatively, cells can be cultured in multi-well imaging plates. Most adherent cell lines that are suitable for indirect immunofluorescence experiments are also appropriate for PARPi-evoked DNA damage response signaling \\(PARPi-DDR) measurements by quantitative image-based cytometry. \r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Cells on coverslips are transferred to 24-well plates and subjected to cell treatments.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. To measure DNA synthesis by EdU \\(5-ethynyl-2'-desoxyuridine) \\(Thermo Fisher Scientific) incorporation, cells are incubated for 20 minutes in medium containing 10 \u03bcM EdU. \r\n  \r\n\n\n4. After treatment, cells are fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 12 minutes at room temperature. The formaldehyde solution is removed and cells are washed once with PBS. When the analysis is focused on extraction-resistant protein pools, a pre-extraction on ice with 0.2% Triton X-100 \\(Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 minutes is performed prior to fixation to remove soluble protein fractions \\(see Troubleshooting section).\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Cells are permeabilized for 5 minutes at room temperature in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washed twice in PBS. This step is not required in pre-extracted samples.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Fixed and permeabilized cells are washed twice in PBS and incubated in blocking solution \\(Filtered DMEM containing 10% FCS and 0.01% sodium azide \\(Fluka)) for 15 min at room temperature. \r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Primary antibodies are diluted in blocking solution and the coverslips are inverted over 35 \u03bcl of the desired primary antibody solution on a flattened piece of parafilm. To avoid evaporation, using a wet chamber is recommended. Here, antibody incubations were performed for 2 hours at room temperature, although incubation time may have to be optimized for every antibody. When combining the staining with EdU detection, an EdU Click-it reaction is performed prior to incubation with the primary antibodies according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations \\(Thermo Fisher Scientific).\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. The coverslips are transferred back to the 24 well dishes, washed 3 times with PBS and inverted over 35 \u03bcl of fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution following the same procedure as in step 7. Secondary antibody incubation is performed for 1 h at room temperature protected from light.\r\n   \r\n\n\n9. The coverslips are transferred back to the 24 well dishes, washed once with PBS and the DNA is stained with a 4\u2019,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole Dihydrochloride \\(DAPI, FluoroPure grade, Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution in PBS \\(DAPI, 0.5 \u03bcg/ml) for 10 min protected from light. After DAPI staining, the coverslips are washed 3 times with PBS. Optimizing DAPI concentration and incubation time for different cell lines, as well as terminating the DNA staining by multiple PBS washes, facilitate quantitative image-based cell cycle staging, so that total DAPI intensities scale with DNA content correspondingly and allow for a discrimination of the different cell cycle phases \\(see Troubleshooting section).\r\n  \r\n\n\n10. Coverslips are briefly washed with distilled water, placed on 3MM paper to dry and mounted on 5 \u03bcl Mowiol-based mounting medium. For Mowiol preparation mix 2.4 g Mowiol with 6.9 g of 86-89% glycerol. While stirring, add 6 ml distilled water and leave stirring for 2 hours at room temperature. Add 12 ml of 0.2 M Tris \\(pH 8.5). Incubate at 50-60 \u00b0C for 10 minutes to resolve all components. Repeat until all components are dissolved. Prepare aliquots and store at -20\u00b0 C. Store mounted coverslips over night at 4\u00b0 C to allow for complete Mowiol polymerization prior to image acquisition \\(see Troubleshooting section).\r\n  \r\n\n\nProtocol Part B: Automated microscopy and image analysis\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Images are acquired in an unbiased fashion with the Olympus ScanR Screening System equipped with an inverted motorized Olympus IX83 microscope, a motorized stage, IR-laser hardware autofocus, a fast emission filter wheel with single band emission filters, and a digital monochrome Hamamatsu ORCA-FLASH 4.0 V2 sCMOS camera \\(2048 x 2048 pixel, 12 bit dynamics). For each condition, image information of large cohorts of cells \\(typically at least 500 cells for the UPLSAPO 40x objective \\(NA 0.9), at least 2000 cells for the UPLSAPO 20x objective \\(NA 0.75), and at least 5000 cells for the UPLSAPO 10x \\(NA 0.4) and UPLSAPO 4x \\(NA 0.16) objectives) is acquired under non-saturating conditions at a single autofocus-directed z-position. The choice of objective and number of acquired images per condition depend on cell density, desired read-out, required image resolution and camera field of view. Besides dedicated high content platforms \\(e.g. Olympus ScanR, Thermo Scientific CellomicsArrayScan, Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra/Micro, GE Healthcare IN Cell Analyzer 6000/2200, Perkin Elmer Opera/Operetta, BD Biosciences BD Pathway 855/435) images acquired with any automated fluorescence microscope, wide-field or confocal, as well as manually acquired images can be subjected to quantitative image-based cytometry analyses \\(see Troubleshooting section).\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Images are analyzed with the inbuilt Olympus ScanR Image Analysis Software. A moderate dynamic background correction is first applied, and DAPI signals are used for segmentation of the nuclei using an integrated intensity-based module that generates masks that identify nuclei as individual objects. This mask is then applied to quantify pixel intensities in the different color channels. Here, total DAPI levels, and mean intensities of EdU, \u03b3H2AX, poly\\(ADP-ribose), PARP1, PARP2, Histone H3 phospho S10 and Cyclin A are measured. For RAD51, BRCA1 and 53BP1 foci segmentation and quantification in high-resolution images an integrated spot-detection module is used. Various commercial software packages and open-source alternatives \\(e.g. ImageJ/Fiji, CellProfiler) can be used for image segmentation and feature extraction \\(see Troubleshooting section).\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. The extracted data is imported to the Spotfire data visualization software \\(TIBCO). Spotfire is used to generate color-coded scatter plots of asynchronous cell populations in a flow-cytometry-like fashion and to quantify percentages and cell \\(sub)population averages. Fluorescence intensities are depicted as arbitrary units. For visualizing discrete data in scatter plots \\(e.g. foci numbers), mild jittering \\(random displacement of data points along the discrete data axes) is applied in order to demerge overlapping data points. Within one experiment, similar cell numbers are compared for the different conditions. The free software environment for statistical computing and graphics R can be used as an alternative for data visualization and analysis."

The time taken for cell culture will vary depending on the cell treatments applied.

The time needed for data visualization and analysis varies dependent on the degree of expertise and experience, the research question\\(s), and the complexity of the experiment. The time needed may thus range from 30 minutes for a simple experiment with known read-outs to several hours for more complex experiments and more thorough analysis of multiple cellular features."

Over confluent cells can preclude proper nuclei segmentation. The optimal cell density should be high enough to allow for a large number of cells to be analyzed per image, while avoiding contact between neighboring cell nuclei in order to facilitate software-assisted object detection.

To overcome these limitations we provide a detailed protocol to assess PARPi toxicity at multiple phenotypic levels based on a high-content microscopy workflow. This approach takes two days and allows for sensitive cell cycle resolved analyses of PARPi-evoked DNA damage response signaling and PARP trapping. The approach can be applied to evaluate conditions of PARPi hypersensitivity and resistance, and to obtain insights in the cellular mechanisms of drug synergism. Moreover, the described workflow is compatible with high-throughput screening for the discovery and characterization of functional interactions between PARPi and other clinically relevant drugs.",
