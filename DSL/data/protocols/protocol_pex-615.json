Human plasma derived drugs separation was also achieved by polyethylene glycol <sup>2</sup>.Polyethylene glycol has the significant role in refolding of active proteins<sup>3</sup>. Polyethylene glycol and ion exchange chromatography method was used for purification of haptoglobin from human plasma fraction that scaled up the proteins in a simple, low cost and fast manner<sup>4</sup>.Polyethylene glycol&nbsp;was already used in biopharmaceutical industry as it enhance the pharmacologic and pharmaceutical properties of proteins<sup>5</sup>.Low abundance plasma proteins was obtained by use of polyethylene glycol and immunoaffinity depletion<sup>6</sup>. After 50% TCA/Acetone precipitation with the HIV-1 infected human plasma proteins , several concentration of polyethylene glycol was used . The 16% polyethylene glycol was found to precipitate and purify the low abundance proteins as which can be resolved in 10% SDSPAGE.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Human plasma contains high amount of abundant proteins like albumin and globulin. Normally, the proteins having potential for biomarkers are present in very low concentration in human plasma. To resolve the low concentration proteins in polyacrylamide gel, the removal of high abundant proteins from plasma are very essential. Polyethylene glycol is a nontoxic, water soluble synthetic polymer has several applications in chemical and biomedical industries. Various molecular variants of poly ethylene glycol is available and used in protein purification. The mechanism behind the use of high concentration of polyethylene glycol is it binds the molecule in more compact or interpenetrates forming a gel like network surrounding the molecule. Polyethylene glycol -6000 removes the high abundant proteins like Albumin and Globulin in the HIV -1 infected plasma samples and concentrates the low molecular weight proteins as the low molecular weight proteins are essential in biomarker study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",
