            "content": "Environmental stresses like drought and high temperature primarily affect the grain yield of cereals by reducing photosynthesis and related carbon metabolism<sup>1</sup>. A comprehensive analysis of the gene network regulating these complex processes will help in development of genetic tools for maintaining yield under stress. The expression of stress related genes is largely affected by transcription factors like AP2, MYB, NAC, bZIP etc. The APETALA2 \\(AP2) family of transcription factors are associated with various developmental and stress related responses in plants and has a highly conserved DNA binding AP2/ERF domain that recognize conserved cis-regulatory elements \\(CRE) of the GCC core<sup>2</sup>. The presence of conserved DNA binding domain in transcription factors therefore can be used for identification of potential regulated genes by both in vivo and in planta assays. \r\n\n\nMany DNA protein interaction studies have been previously done using in vitro assays such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay \\(EMSA). However, chromatin immuno-precipitation \\(ChIP) has now become a powerful tool to detect in vivo interactions between DNA-binding proteins and genomic DNA. ChIP DNA can be combined with RNA-seq or massively parallel sequencing to identify gene regulatory networks active during the biological processes of grain filling and/or in response to the environmental stresses. The ChIP procedure includes: \\(1) Crosslinking of DNA with protein in vivo using formaldehyde; \\(2) Sonication of the fixed chromatin to an average size of 500\u2009bp ranging from 200 to 1000\u2009bp; \\(3) Extraction of chromatin using different buffers; \\(4) Immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies; \\(5) Removal of beads, reverse crosslinking, elution of DNA and purification; \\(6) qPCR analysis of the bound DNA relative to positive and negative controls. However the major disadvantage of ChIP technology is the requirement of antibodies specific to the protein of interest. Here we report the use of TAP \\(tandem affinity purification) tagged system which has previously been used for identification of protein interaction partners<sup>3,4</sup> for identification of targets of transcription factors \\(DNA-protein interaction) in rice, making use of the commonly used His and myc antibodies. Furthermore, to elucidate the role of TFs in directly activating its targets in the transcription complex, we report here on the use of the steroid receptor-based inducible system. The TF is fused with a human estradiol receptor \\(HER) which renders the transcription factor inactive in the cell as it is sequestered in the cytoplasm via binding to a cytoplasmic complex. In presence of estrogen \\(estradiol), the complex is disrupted owing to the binding of the hormone to the steroid-binding domain thereby allowing the transcription factor to enter the nucleus and regulate the expression of the downstream target genes<sup>5</sup>. In the presence of cycloheximide \\(translation inhibitor) only the targeted transcription factor and its downstream target genes will be induced while the other downstream genes will not be induced owing to lack of protein synthesis, thereby making this steroid-inducible system a potential tool for identification direct targets of transcription factors<sup>6,7</sup>. The present study describes the protocol for identification of targets of an AP2 transcription factor HYR in rice followed by validation using a luciferase assay with the Dual Glo luciferase assay system \\(firefly luciferase luminescence normalized to renilla luciferase). Finally, the protocol describes the identification of the direct targets identified from ChIP and luciferase assay using a steroid receptor based inducible system."

A tandem affinity purification TAP-tagged construct of the AP2 TF transformed into rice is used in chromatin immunoprecipitation \\(ChIP) assays to verify the putative AP2-regulated genes that are first identified from gene expression data and analysis of cis-regulatory elements in their promoters. Transcriptional activation/repression of the AP2 TF bound promoters is experimentally validated by a Dual Glo luciferase assay system \\(firefly luciferase luminescence normalized to renilla luciferase) using putative regulated promoters cloned upstream of the luciferase and co-transformed with a construct expressing the AP2 TF in rice protoplasts. Finally, the protocol describes the identification of the direct targets identified from ChIP and luciferase assay using a steroid receptor based inducible system.",
