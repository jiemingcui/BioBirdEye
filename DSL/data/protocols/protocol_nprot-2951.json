            "content": "The highly sensitive detection of LCN2<sup>1</sup>, also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin \\(NGAL), is desired in clinical diagnosis as it is an important prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for several medical conditions. It is a small 25 kDa glycoprotein, which is found in neutrophils and certain epithelia such as renal tubules. The LCN2 level in healthy humans is 0.7 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, which increases in cases of ischemic<sup>2</sup> or nephrotoxic injury<sup>3</sup>, cardiovascular surgery, kidney transplants<sup>4-6</sup>, coronary heart disease<sup>7-8</sup>, fatty liver disease, obesity<sup>9</sup>, bacterial infections<sup>10-11</sup> and cancer<sup>12-15</sup>. The down-regulation of LCN2 occurs in glioblastoma<sup>16</sup>, ovarian cancer<sup>14</sup>, microglial cells<sup>17</sup> and in response to excessive exposure to high electromagnetic fields<sup>18</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe developed GNPs-based sandwich ELISA procedure<sup>19</sup> has higher sensitivity and reduced immunoassay duration in comparison to commercial sandwich ELISA kits and our previously developed immunoassay procedures<sup>20-24</sup>. It involves the APTES functionalization of GNPs and MTP, and EDC-based heterobifunctional crosslinking of anti-LCN2 capture antibodies \\(**Fig. 1**). The high sensitivity of the developed procedure is mainly due to the increased surface area provided by GNPs, which leads to higher immobilization density of anti-LCN2 capture antibodies. The developed immunoassay detects the entire pathophysiological range of LCN2 in the real sample matrices i.e. diluted human serum, plasma and whole blood. It has a very high precision as it correlates well with the conventional ELISA. Therefore, it is ideal for mass-use clinical and industrial settings as the anti-LCN2 antibody-bound MTPs, stored at 4\u00b0C in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline \\(PBS), did not lose their functional activity even after 8 weeks. Moreover, it is a generic sandwich ELISA procedure that can also be employed in _in vitro_ diagnostics \\(IVD) for the detection of other disease biomarkers and analytes."

            "content": "The developed GNPs-based sandwich ELISA<sup>19</sup> detected 0.6-5120 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> of LCN2 \\(**Fig. 2A**) with linearity in the range of 80-2560 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The limit of detection \\(LOD) and analytical sensitivity of LCN2 immunoassay were 0.7 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> and 1 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Various experimental controls were employed that demonstrated the absence of non-specific interactions between the immunoassay components \\(**Fig. 2B**). The inter- and intra-day variability were in the range of 1-10.2 % and 2-13.7 %, respectively, while the half-effective concentration \\(EC50) was 435 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The intraday variability was determined by six assay repeats in a day, while the interday variability was calculated from six assay repeats on six different days. The developed immunoassay has high precision as it correlates well with the commercial sandwich ELISA. It enables LCN2 detection in atual sample matrices \\(**Fig. 2C**), as demonstrated by the analysis of human LCN2-spiked samples that were prepared by mixing various human LCN2 concentrations in 1:1000 diluted human plasma, serum and whole blood.\r\n\n\n    The developed procedure significantly decreased the overall assay duration by more than 3-fold i.e. from 20 h \\(commercial sandwich ELISA) to 5.5 h. It has 80-fold better analytical sensitivity \\(1 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>) than that of commercial LCN2 ELISA \\(80 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>). Moreover, it has better bioanalytical performance \\(lower LOD and better analytical sensitivity) than our previously developed LCN2 immunoassay<sup>20</sup>. All these immunoassays were performed under identical conditions using the same components to obviate process variability. The higher sensitivity of the developed ELISA is mainly due to the increased surface area provided by GNPs functionalization, which leads to high antibody immobilization density. The antibody immobilization strategy further enables the leach-proof covalent binding of capture anti-LCN2 antibodies by EDC-based crosslinking of its carboxyl groups to the free amino groups on silanized GNPs-functionalized MTP.  \r\n\n\n    The anti-LCN2 capture antibody-bound MTPs can be stored at 4\u00b0C in 0.1 M PBS for up to 8 weeks without any significant loss of their functional activity \\(**Fig. 2D**), which is desired for clinical and industrial analysis. The developed procedure is multisubstrate-compatible<sup>19</sup> and can be used to perform sandwich ELISA on various substrates using our previously developed modified MTP format<sup>25</sup>. The multisubstrate-compatibility was due to the generic nature of silanization and GNPs functionalization steps. The developed procedure has got tremendous potential to improve the bioanalytical performance of sandwich ELISA-based IVD kits."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "We report a highly-sensitive graphene nanoplatelets \\(GNPs)-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent immunoassay \\(ELISA) procedure for the detection of human lipocalin-2 \\(LCN2). It involves the functionalization of 96-well microtiter plate \\(MTP) with GNPs \\(dispersed in 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane \\(APTES)). APTES generates the free amino groups on MTP and GNPs, which are used for the  leach-proof covalent binding of anti-LCN2 capture antibody by 1-ethyl-3-\\(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride \\(EDC) based heterobifunctional crosslinking. The developed immunoassay detects LCN2 in the range of 0.6-5120 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> with limit of detection and analytical sensitivity of 0.7 and 1 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. It is the most sensitive immunoassay for LCN2, which has 80-fold higher analytical sensitivity and 3-fold reduced immunoassay duration than the commercial sandwich ELISA kit. The anti-LCN2 antibody-bound MTPs, stored at 4\u00b0C in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline \\(PBS), were highly stable as they did not show any decrease in functional activity for 8 weeks.",
