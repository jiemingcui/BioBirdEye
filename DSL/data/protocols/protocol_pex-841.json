            "content": "<p>Through fusion of cytidine deaminases, such as rAPOBEC1<sup>1</sup>, hAID<sup>2</sup>, hAPOBEC3A<sup>3-5</sup> or PmCDA1<sup>6-8</sup> at the N or C terminus of Cas9n (Cas9 D10A), CBEs were developed to efficiently generate C-to-T transitions. Their efficiency was further enhanced by the presence of a uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) domain either through direct fusion to the C terminus or separately delivered with CBEs<sup>7,9</sup>. The editing window of CBEs (such as BE3, BE4 or BE4max) is typically located 4-8 nucleotides downstream from the 5\u2032 end of the targeted sequence distal to the PAM site<sup>1,7,10</sup>. Base editors could only edit the nucleotides within this window which is determined by the intrinsic feature of distinct deaminases. Great efforts have been made to either reduce or increase the editing window to generate versatile base editors for various purposes. Three BE3s have been developed with the editing window within three nucleotides, but their activity is either comparable or reduced compared with BE3<sup>11</sup>. Through structure-based design and modifications of hAPOBEC3A, eA3A-BE3 has been shown to selectively generate C-to-T conversions within the TC motifs but not in a non-cognate bystander motif<sup>4</sup>. </p><p>On the contrary, base editors with increased targeting range are also valuable to generate more genotypes for saturation mutagenesis, disrupt gene function or correct genetic mutations for gene therapy. These innovative modifications had no significant impact on the editing efficiency which is critical for CBE applications, especially for therapeutic purposes. Several studies have shown to enhance C-to-T base editing activity through codon optimization, nuclear localization signal (NLS) modification<sup>10</sup> or molecular evolution through phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) of distinct cytidine deaminases<sup>12</sup>, but these enhanced CBEs are inefficient at catalyzing cytidines adjacent to the PAM site.</p><p>Since cytidine deaminases mainly catalyze C-to-T conversion on the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrate generated by Cas9 D10A nickase, we hypothesized that fusion of a non-sequence specific ssDBD might increase the binding affinity and editing activity.Through the screen of ten ssDBDs, serial hyper CBEs (hyCBEs) were generated through fusion of ssDBD from Rad51 to BE4max, A3A-BE4max and eA3A-BE4max. HyCBEs exhibited higher activity and broader editing window than the original CBEs, and hyeA3A-BE4max exhibited a high preference for TC motifs with a broader targeting range. As an example, hyeA3A-BE4max could specifically generate C-to-T conversion at the -117 site in hemoglobin gamma (HBG) promoter to reactivate the \u03b3-globin gene expression in HUDEP-2 cells,suggesting the potential of hyeA3A-BE4max in gene therapy. This protocol below contains the construction of the hyCBEs and the application of hyeA3A-BE4max in HUDEP-2 cells.</p>"

The diluted virus and cells is then incubated in a 37 \u00b0C ,5% CO2 incubator overnight.\nCritical step:\nThe virus from -80\u00b0C should be thawed on ice. The infection operation should be performed in a biosafety cabinet and on ice.\nDay 3:\nReplace HEK293T growth media\nAspirate the virus-containing culture medium and gently add 100 ul of complete culture medium to each well to facilitate cell growth about 24 hours after infection.There will be a preliminary expression of fluorescence.\nDay 5:\nDetection and analysis\n\u2460 3 days post-infection, count the number of cells before loading the calibur flow cytometry and fluorescent observation of virus-infected cells under a microscope and analyze to quantify the (%) EGFP via Fortessa Flow Cell Analyzer (BD).\nCritical step:\nThe density of experimental and blank wells is same.After the cells are centrifuged, the sample wells are resuspended by about 300ul.\n\u2461 Select wells with a fluorescence ratio between 1-20% for calculation after Flowjo analysis. The calculation formula is as follows:\nTiter (TU / ml) = number of cells x percent fluorescence x 10\n3\n/ volume of virus stock solution (ul).\nTiter (TU/ml) = cell number * (%) EGFP *10\n3\n/virus stock volume (ul)\nFor example: A virus with a concentration of 0.1ul has a fluorescence ratio of 20%, the total number of cells is 8x10\n4\n,Titer (TU / ml) = 8 x 10\n4\nx 20% x 10\n3\n/ 0.1 = 1.6x10\n8\n.\nIf you want to infect 2 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells, MOI = 30 (1 cell corresponds to 30 virus particles) (see the Critical step), you need the virus volume to be = 2 \u00d7 10\n5\nx 30 / 1.6 x 10\n8\n(ml) = 0.0375 ml = 37.5 ul.\nCritical step:\nMOI is the abbreviation of multiplicity of infection. The actual meaning is how many viable viruses each cell is infected with. The optimal MOI values of various cells are different.\nC: HUDEP-2(\u0394\nG\n\u03b3) cell infection and genomic DNA preparation\nDay 1:\nLentiviral infection of HUDEP-2(\u0394\nG\n\u03b3)\nInfect 2\u00d7 10\n5\nHUDEP-2(\u0394\nG\n\u03b3) cells (or as required) at 48 well plate with the Lenti 117G-hyA3A-BE4max-P2A-GFP/ Lenti 117G-hyeA3A-BE4max-P2A-GFP lentivirus in the presence of polybrene (8 \u00b5g/\u00b5l) at an MOI =40 respectively. The volume of virus added is calculated as described above.\nCritical step 1:\nAdd 250ul total cell culture medium for 48 well,50ul virus plus 0.25ul polybrene and 200ul complete cell culture medium is used to infect HUDEP-2(\u0394\nG\n\u03b3) cells.\nCritical step 2:\nHUDEP-2(\u0394\nG\n\u03b3) cells maintaine and expand in serum-free expansion medium (SFEM; Stem Cell Technologies) supplemented with human Stem Cell Factor (SCF, 50 ng/ ml, PeproTech), Erythropoietin (EPO, 3 IU/ml, PeproTech), dexamethasone (DEX, 1\u00b5M, Sigma), doxycycline (DOX, 1 \u00b5g/ml, TAKARA Bio, Japan) and 2% Pen/Strep (Gibco). All cell lines used are maintained in the incubator at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2.\nDay 3:\nSort positive cells and culture\n3 days post-infection, select about 1000-2000 for successfully infected cells by sorting the cells for a fluorescence marker. Then add complete cell medium with 2% P/S and plate to 96-well plates and continue to expand the culture.\nDay 10-15:\nGenomic DNA preparation\nFor about 7-10 days after selection, harvest at least 8x10\n4\nHUDEP-2(\u0394\nG\n\u03b3) cells for genomic DNA extraction. Genomic DNA extraction method as described above using Blood/cell/tissue DNA Isolation Kit.\nD:Gene editing efficiency evaluation\nThe DNA fragment containing the target 117G is amplified through PCR using HBG-\u0394\nG\n\u03b3-117G-F(Merlin)/ R(Merlin) primer and roughly confirmed by sanger sequencing using KOD\u2013Plus-Neo DNA Polymerase. Followed by high-throughput deep sequencing to obtain precise editing efficiency with site-specific primers 117G-Hitom-F/R containing an adaptor sequence (Forward 5\u2032-ggagtgagtacggtgtgc-3\u2032; Backward 5\u2032-gagttggatgctggatgg-3\u2032) at the 5\u2032 end. The above products are then subjected to a second-round PCR . The resulting libraries are mixed and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform.\nThe primers described above are as follows :\nHBG-\u0394\nG\n\u03b3-117G-F(Merlin) :AGTGTGTGGACTATTAGTCAA\nHBG-\u0394\nG\n\u03b3-117G-R(Merlin) :catggcgtctggactaggag\n117G-Hitom-F :ggagtgagtacggtgtgctggaatgactgaatcggaacaaggc\n117G-Hitom-R :gagttggatgctggatggctggcctcactggatactctaagact\nE: Statistics analysis\nThe C>T, A, G conversions and indels in the HTS data are analyzed using BE-Analyzer\n15\nor CRISPResso2\n16\n.

Further improvement of the editing range and efficiency is critical for their broader applications. In this protocol, we demonstrated that fusion of the single-strand DNA binding domain (ssDBD) from Rad51 protein between Cas9n and cytidine deaminases, serial hyper CBEs (hyCBEs) were generated with substantially increased activity and an expanded editing window toward the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in cell lines<strong>.</strong> Moreover, hyeA3A-BE4max specifically generated a C-to-T conversion without inducing bystander mutations in the hemoglobin gamma (HBG) gene promoter to mimic a naturally occurring genetic variant for amelioration of \u03b2-hemoglobinopathy, suggesting the therapeutic potential of the improved base editors. This step-by-step protocol is related to the publication \u201cIncreasing the efficiency and targeting range of cytidine base editors through fusion of a single-strand DNA binding protein domain\u201d in Nature Cell Biology.</p>",
