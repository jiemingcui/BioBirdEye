            "content": "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging \\(MRI) is a non invasive clinical diagnostic tool for acquiring high resolution three dimensional anatomical images of the heart that provide vital information on its biomechanical and functional properties<sup>1-3,4,7</sup>. Obtaining high precision MR images however requires complementation of contrast agents for visible structural demarcation of the healthy and damaged tissues against the circulating blood by altering the intrinsic tissue contrast properties<sup>5,6,7</sup>. These contrast agents thus play a pivotal role in MRI. The most commonly used paramagnetic agents are iron nanoparticles<sup>3,5,8,9,10</sup>, gadolinium<sup>5</sup>, and manganese<sup>11</sup> of which iron nanoparticles have been widely studied and used. \r\n\n\nThe use of MRI in tandem with contrast agents for cellular labeling has been gaining importance as an experimental research in the field of stem cells and tissue engineering<sup>7,11</sup>, where the success of the treatment modality is staggered with the lack of knowledge on the fate of the post transplanted cells. Thus the ability of labeling cells with paramagnetic nanoparticles and tracking the cellular migration, homing, engraftment and eventually determining its fate<sup>3,7</sup> provides valuable information for improvement and also in determining its translational efficacy. \r\n\n\nExperimental studies in cellular labeling with nanoparticles have been long ongoing<sup>12-17</sup>, Super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles \\(SPIONs) in particular, have been of interest to both researchers and clinicians because of its size, cellular uptake, super paramagnetic properties, biocompatibility, relatively low toxicity and safer incorporation of the degraded iron into the hemoglobin of the circulatory system<sup>4,6-9</sup>, in comparison to other contrast agents. Moreover, the feasibility, safety and efficacy of stem cell labeling have been well investigated in mesenchymal stem cells<sup>3, 11, 15-18</sup>. \r\n\n\nThe efficacy of cellular uptake of SPIONS however, has been found to enhance upon surface modification with cationic transfecting agents such as poly L-lysine and protamine sulphate<sup>13,15</sup>. Additionally the cationic transfecting agents also help in the slowing the degradation process of the nanoparticles in the system, and thereby increasing its retention time and thus providing a broader window for MR imaging in comparison to the non coated SPION particles7-9. Despite the promises cationic transfecting agent coated SPION hold, there are concerns over its toxicity that may arise with increasing dosage in the system upon degradation, which has thus lead to the use of neutral polymer such as poly ethylene glycol \\(PEG) for a safer mode of surface modification<sup>7,19,20</sup>. \r\n\n\nFurther development in the application of the polymer coated nanoparticles has determined its potential for specific cellular labeling based on cell surface marker expression. The segregation of a desired cell population is feasible by coating the SPION PEG particles with tissue specific antibodies. The interaction of the tissue specific antibodies with the cell surface antigen aids in isolation of an enriched homogenous cell population that could be sorted through immunomagnetic techniques such as magnetic activated cell sorter \\(MACS) <sup>15,16,21</sup>.  This strategy is highly beneficial in stem cell or precursor cell based therapies where cells with good quality cells are required for faster tissue repair. \r\n\n\nCardiac tissue regeneration using stem cell based therapy is one of the widely researched fields of regenerative medicine which is yet to establish its success owing to the complexity that is associated with the cardiac architecture. Various strategies have been adopted for attaining functional cardiomyocytes by either administering stem cells or by extensive laboratory manipulation<sup>16,22-26</sup>  however, satisfactory results are yet to be achieved. Alternatively, we have addressed this issue by adopting a straight forward, potent prototype for enrichment of cardiac progenitor cells from the heterogeneous adipose tissue derived stromal vascular fraction in a faster, reliable, economical and in a scalable way with our engineered nanoprobe GloTrack and have established the isolation of cardiac precursor cells with a higher translational value. \r\n\n\nThe GloTrack probe was designed and engineered by exploiting the theranostic property of the SPIONS by acting as a cardiac specific cellular label as well as a contrast agent for tracking. The cardiac cell specific labeling was approached with the aim of tagging the PEGylated SPIONS with antibodies that have conserved gene expression in cells with higher tendency to be driven into terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. Extensive cardiac gene expression profiling have been carried out with induced pluripotent stem cells \\(iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells \\(ESCs) <sup>27-29</sup> and conclusive results from both the studies have demonstrated conserved expression for signal regulator protein alpha \\(SIRPA) and kinase insert domain receptor \\(KDR) throughout the differentiation pathway<sup>27-29</sup>. Our data corroborates with the previous reports and establishes similar phenotype and genotype in mesenchymal stem cell population derived from adipose tissue <sup>15,16</sup>.  \r\n\n\nSIRPA is a trans-membrane protein of the signal regulatory protein \\(SIRP) family which is found to be expressed from the early until late stages of the cardiac differentiation pathway<sup>27,30,31</sup> However, till date its role in cardiomyocyte formation is not clearly delineated. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the SIRPA+ cells to have a higher tendency to differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes<sup>27</sup>. Similarly, the expression of KDR, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 has also been found to be expressed by the cardiovascular progenitor cells leading to the formation of the blood cells, cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells<sup>28,29,32-34</sup>. Thus the selection of SIRPA+/KDR+ cells will be a simple straightforward approach for obtaining a highly enriched cell population..\r\n\n\nIn this study, we were interested in understanding the physical attributes of the GloTrack construct and have extensively characterized and evaluated through in vivo MR imaging. Various characterization approaches such as transmission electron microscopy \\(TEM), atomic force microscopy \\(AFM), high resolution scanning electron microscopy \\(SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy \\(CLSM), fluorescence-activated cell sorting \\(FACS), and zeta sizer were used. Through this study we are expanding our understanding on the charge, size, surface topography, and tracking efficiency. \r\n\n\nOur previous work has demonstrated the validation of GloTrack in an ex-vivo setting for its relatively low cytotoxicity at cellular and molecular levels along with labeling efficiency by phantom cell-gel experiment and have optimized for the SPION and cell concentration for effective MR signals<sup>15,16</sup>. Herein, we have further evaluated its potential application in an in vivo setting in C57BL/6 mice. This was achieved using a MR based experiment for its traceability and signal to noise optimization. Thus this present report is an improvised protocol for further characterization, evaluation and extrapolation for dual purpose of cell therapy while tracking the cells for the intended purpose as mentioned above.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSALIENT FEATURES and LIMITATION TO THE STUDY\r\n\n\n\u2022 Faster and economical approach to obtain a pure population of cells that have a higher potential to differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes\r\n\n\n\u2022 Potent prototype for non-invasive in vivo tracking and an effective nanocarrier.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Reliable and non toxic methodology  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\r\n\n\n\u2022 Requires applicable regulatory clearances for translation into clinical trials."

            "content": "This study describes the construction of GloTrack for segregation of cardiac precursor cells using a minimally manipulative strategy which is economical, scalable, reliable and potent. It additionally serves the purpose of a nanocarrier using diagnostic tools such as MRI. We aimed to characterize the physical attributes such as shape, size, surface topology and surface charge of the GloTrack that determines its cell binding or uptake. \r\n\n\nThe size of the GloTrack was evaluated using multiple techniques such as SEM, TEM and Zeta sizer. The morphological observations from the TEM and SEM micrographs demonstrated an increase in size of the GloTrack \\(Figs 2c and 2f) in comparison to SPIONs and SPION-PEG \\(Figs 2a, b and 2 d, e). Semi-quantitative measurement of the GloTrack confirmed a variable size range which was comparable to the quantitative measurement studies obtained through zetasizer, as an average size range of 900 nm with a poly dispersity index \\(PDI) of 0.728 \\(Fig 4f). The surface topology and depth analysis of the GloTrack demonstrated a non uniform topology in SPIONs, SPION-PEG and GloTrack by AFM \\(Figs. 3 a, b, c). The peak formation observed on the surface of the GloTrack exhibited a maximum height of 1.6 nm as compared to the SPION-PEG and SPION \\(Fig 3f). Similarly, a difference in the surface charge has also been detected with the GloTrack as to the SPION and SPION-PEG in the zeta potential measurement studies \\(Figs 3a, c, e). The SPIONs impart a highly negative charge but in the presence of PEG coating \\(confirmed by Raman Spectral images \u2013Fig 1 SI) there is a shift in its surface charge \\(Fig 3a). \r\n\n\nThe charge exhibited by the GloTrack \\(Fig 3e) is relatively similar to that of the SPION-PEG \\(Fig 3c). \r\n\n\nThe physical characterization studies of the GloTrack confirmed a difference in size, topology and surface charge. Likewise, the confirmation of the presence of the two monoclonal antibodies and its distribution across the GloTrack was carried out through confocal \\(Fig 5a-c) and FACS \\(Fig 5d-f). The qualitative images of the confocal microscope proved a uniform coating/distribution of both the antibodies on the surface of the PEG coated SPION particles \\(Fig 5c). This information was corroborated through quantitative analysis of the same through FACS. The data obtained from FACS clearly demonstrated a 99.6 % binding of the both the monoclonal antibodies to the surface of the GloTrack \\(Fig 5f). Through the physical attributes and the monoclonal antibody distribution studies, we can confirm successful engineering of the GloTrack, a cardiac precursor nanoprobe. \r\n\n\nIn addition, we were also interested in in vivo tracking potential of these engineered probes through MRI and have executed it in C57BL6 mice over a 90 minute period. The MR images following intravenous administration provided two important information; firstly, the size of our engineered nanoparticles and its potentially altered in vivo hydrodynamic diameter \\(this was not characterized in this study) was compatible for administration. In addition, the data also clearly showed that the core SPION imparted strong MR signals for imaging \\(Fig 6 aiii and biii). The migration studies of the administered GloTrack over a 90 minute period had a significantly higher accumulation in the cardiac muscle in comparison to the kidney or liver \\(Fig 6c). The MR data has also observed a relatively higher movement of the GloTrack towards the kidney than the liver \\(Fig 6d). \r\n\n\nHowever, through this protocol we would like to substantiate that this is a potent method for strategically segregating our desired cell population from both cardiac and non cardiac origin. These cells have a higher translational value for cardiac repair as they are cardiac precursor cells as demonstrated by FACS for SIRPA+/KDR+. The fate of these sorted cells post transplantation can be determined through MRI. Additionally, this developed process can be extrapolated for wider application and other disease indications."

Herein, we describe a modified approach which is economical and potent prototype of a cardiac precursor nanoprobe called GloTrack. It functions as a cell label and tracking agent. GloTrack constitutes cardiac specific antibodies - SIRPA and KDR that are bound to the surface of PEG coated SPION, which aids in the segregation of cardiac precursor cells from cardiac/non cardiac origin. We aimed to characterize its physical attributes for size \\(CLSM, TEM, SEM, Zetasizer), labeling efficiency \\(FACS), topology \\(AFM) and surface charge \\(Zeta potential). In addition, we determined it\u2019s in vivo distribution through MRI. The results establish GloTrack as a negatively charged, 900 nm size on an average with a variable topology, 99% labeling efficiency, having a uniform distribution of SIRPA+/KDR+, and has the feasibility of tracking in vivo using 7T MRI.",
