            "content": "Conventional human PSCs, either derived from early embryos \\(Thomson et al., 1998) or by reprogramming of somatic cells by OSKM \\(Takahashi et al., 2007), resemble a developmental stage named primed pluripotency. Primed PSCs express OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in response to FGF and TGF-beta signals, display higher levels of repressive epigenetic modifications and are mostly glycolytic \\(Hackett and Surani, 2014; Nichols and Smith, 2009). Different primed PSC lines display a differentiation bias toward some germ layers \\(Osafune et al., 2008). \r\n\n\nMurine PSCs are thought to represent a less advanced developmental state, called na\u00efve pluripotent state, characterized by expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Klf4 and Tfcp2l1 in response to the cytokine LIF and inhibition of GSK3 and MEK kinases \\(Dunn et al., 2014). Murine na\u00efve PSCs display low levels of repressive epigenetic modification, such as trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 \\(H3K9me3) or cytosine methylation \\(Ficz et al., 2013; Leitch et al., 2013; Marks et al., 2012) and are metabolically sustained by high levels of oxidative phosphorylation \\(Carbognin et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2012). Importantly, murine na\u00efve PSCs efficiently generate cells of all three germ layers.\r\n\n\nRecently, human  na\u00efve PSCs have been generated either by expression of transgenes via viral vectors together with genomic reporter constructs, or directly from human embryos \\(Davidson et al., 2015; Ware, 2017; Weinberger et al., 2016).\r\n\n\nThe use of human embryos has ethical limitations and obviously does not allow generation of patient-specific na\u00efve PSCs, while conversion of somatic cells to na\u00efve pluripotency with available protocols requires one or more rounds of stable genetic manipulations that are time-consuming, inefficient, and potentially mutagenic. To overcome such limitations, we derived a strategy for the efficient generation of transgene-free na\u00efve iPSCs directly from somatic cells by delivery of modified messenger RNAS \\(mmRNAs) with microfluidics \\(\u00b5F). The use of \u00b5F leads to a reduction in the number of cells needed and costs of two orders of magnitude, with a significant increase in reprogramming efficiency."

Place the patterned wafer in a Petri dish and then in a desiccator, containing a small beaker with few drops of hexamethyldisilazane \\(HMDS).\r\n\n\nb. Connect the desiccator to the vacuum line to reduce the pressure inside the desiccator; keep the wafer under vacuum for 30 minutes.\r\n\n\nc. Pour Sylgard 184 PDMS in a plastic cup in a 10:1 base:curing-agent ratio, mix it thoroughly for at least 3 minutes.\r\n\n\nd. Place the uncured PDMS in a desiccator and connect it to the vacuum line to evacuate the air; turn off the vacuum and keep the PDMS under vacuum in order to remove the bubbles. After 15 minutes vent the desiccator.\r\n\n\ne. Place the wafer with PDMS into the vacuum desiccator for a 10 minutes and check for complete removal of bubbles.\r\n\n\nf.

Prepare the reservoirs as PDMS pieces of 5 x 0.5 cm and punch them with a 3-mm biopsy punch.\r\n\n\nk. Clean thoroughly a microscopy glass slide with MICRO-90 cleaning solution \\(2% v/v in distilled water) and rinse with distilled water.\r\n\n\nl. Place the PDMS replica, with the patterned surface facing up, and a glass slide in an air plasma cleaner for surface activation at 0.3 mbar of filtered air and 30 W for 2 minutes. \r\n\n\nm.

Place the device in an oven at 80\u00b0C for 1 hour to complete the bonding process.\r\n\n\nq. Cool the bonded microfluidic device to room temperature.\r\n\n\nr. Pipette 12 \u00b5L of 2-propanol inside each culture chamber to clean the chamber from production process by-products, and rinse by flowing 30 \u00b5L of distilled water into the chambers before 2-propanol evaporation.\r\n\n\ns. Dry the chambers by aspirating the water with a 200 \u00b5L pipette and package the microfluidic device inside an autoclave bag.\r\n\n\nt. Autoclave at 121\u02daC for 15 minutes, and let it dry at the end.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nmmRNA preparation:\r\n\n\nResuspend each mmRNA \\(POU5F1, SOX2, MYC, KLF4, NANOG, with or without nGFP) and mix them following manufacturer datasheet, omitting LIN28 mmRNA. The molar ratio among different factors should be 3:1:1:1:1:1, with POU5F1 being the most abundant. Each mmRNA is resuspended at a concentration of 100 ng/\u00b5l and the following volumes of each factor are mixed together: POU5F1 520\u00b5l, KLF4 183\u00b5l, SOX2 155\u00b5l, cMYC 200\u00b5l, NANOG 136\u00b5l, nuclear eGFP 124\u00b5l.   Aliquot mixed mmRNAs in small amount \\(5 to 10 \u00b5l) in 0.2 ml sterile microtubes. Avoid freezing-and-thawing more than 2 times. Alternatively, mmRNA can be produced in-house as described by Warren and colleagues \\(Warren et al., 2010).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFibroblasts Medium:\r\n\n\nSupplement DMEM with 10% FBS. Addition of antibiotics is optional. We normally perform reprogramming without antibiotics.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nComplete Primed Reprogramming Medium \\(PRM):\r\n\n\nAdd to StemMACS ReproBREW XF Basal Medium, the 50X StemMACS ReproBREW XF Supplement and store at 4\uf0b0C.  Add B18R \\(final concentration 0.2 \u00b5g/ml), RI \\(5 \u00b5M), CH \\(1 \u00b5M) only when reprogramming starts and do not store for more than 72 h.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRSeT for Na\u00efve Reprogramming:\r\n\n\nAdd the 5x Supplement, 500x Supplement and 1000x Supplement to RSeT Basal Medium according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and store at 4\uf0b0C. Add B18R \\(final concentration 0.2 \u00b5g/ml) only when reprogramming starts and do not store for more than 72 h.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nReprogramming protocol:\r\n\n\n1. Day -1 - Seeding of Human Fibroblasts in microfluidics \\(\u00b5F) chip:\r\n  a. Place the \u00b5F chip inside a 100 mm cell culture dish. Please see Supplementary Figure 1A of Giulitti et al., 2018 for a diagram showing the different parts of the microfluidics chip and how it is used.\r\n\n\nb. Add 3 ml PBS-/- to the 100mm cell culture dish containing the \u00b5F chip and let it spread in the dish, without covering the \u00b5F chip. The dish works as a sterile humidified chamber. Throughout the reprogramming protocol make sure the dish is humidified by adding PBS-/- when needed. \r\n\n\nc. Prepare a 25 \u03bcg/ml fibronectin solution in PBS-/- and inject 12 \u00b5l in each channel.\r\n\n\nd. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\r\n\n\ne. Calculate the number of fibroblasts needed for the reprogramming experiment. We want to plate fibroblasts at 25 cells/mm2 and the total surface of one channel is ~27 mm2, thus 675 cells per channel are needed. In fact, for each channel we have to use 1500 cells, because inlet and outlet volumes must be taken into account. \r\n\n\nf. Detach fibroblasts by washing with PBS-/- twice, then add trypsin and incubate at 37\uf0b0C for 3-4 minutes. Add at least 3 volumes of Fibroblast Medium and transfer the cell suspension in a sterile 15 ml tube. \r\n\n\ng. Count fibroblasts with chamber and transfer to sterile tube only the number of fibroblasts previously calculated in \\(e). Spin at 300 rcf for 4 minutes in a benchtop microcentrifuge.\r\n\n\nh. Resuspend the cell pellet in fresh Fibroblast Medium. For each \u00b5F channel, 12 \u00b5l are needed. For example, for 20 channels 30,000 cells have to be resuspended in 240 \u00b5l of Fibroblast Medium.\r\n\n\ni. Inject 12 \u00b5l of cell suspension per channel. Please note that the volume of the \u00b5F channel is\n6 \u00b5l, but\n12 \u00b5l are needed to fill also the inlet and outlet of each channel.\r\n\n\nj. Remove excess of liquid from reservoirs \\(leave enough medium to form a meniscus).\r\n\n\nk. Culture overnight in Low oxygen incubator \\(37\u00b0C, CO2 5%, O2 5%).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Day 0, 9 a.m. - Preparation for the first transfection:\r\n  a. Calculate the total volume of PRM needed for the first 3 days of reprogramming experiment as follows: 12\u00b5l**2 \\(number of daily media changes)**number of channels**3 days**1.2 \\(to allow 20% excess of medium). For example, for 20 channels 1,728 \u00b5l. The same amount of complete PRM will be needed also at day 3.\r\n\n\nb. Add RI \\(5 \u00b5M), CH \\(1 \u00b5M) and B18R \\(0.2 \u00b5g/ml) and do not store for more than 3 days.\r\n\n\nc. Leave complete PRM medium at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and add 12 \u00b5l to each channel. Remove excess of exhausted medium from reservoirs.\r\n\n\nd. Transfer \u00b5F chips back into the incubator for at least 1 hour before transfection. B18R is a component of the complete PRM that reduces the innate immune response and prepares cells for transfection of mmRNA. It must be present in all media used throughout the reprogramming protocol.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Day 0, 10 a.m. - Prepare mmRNA Transfection mix:\r\n  a. All volumes indicated in this section refer to one \u00b5F channel, please multiply them by the number of channels used in the reprogramming experiment.\r\n\n\nb. Thaw mmRNA aliquots on ice, use StemMACS mRNA Transfection Kit transfection reagent \\(TR) + transfection buffer \\(TB). In RNase-free sterile 0.2 ml tubes prepare the following mixes: \r\n\n\ni. Mix A: 0.27 \u00b5l TB + 0.09 \u00b5l mmRNAs\r\n\n\nii. Mix B: 0.333 \u00b5l TB + 0.027 \u00b5l TR\r\n\n\nc. Transfer Mix B to Mix A and mix gently 4-5 times. The total volume of transfection mix for one channel should be 0.72 \u00b5l.\r\n\n\nd. Incubate for 20 min at RT.\r\n\n\ne. Gently transfer 0.7 \u00b5l of Mix A+B to a tube containing 11.3 \u00b5l of complete PRM. Mix gently 4-5 times.\r\n\n\nf. Dispense 12 \u00b5l of mix to each channel. Remove excess of exhausted medium from reservoirs.\r\n\n\ng. Incubate in Low oxygen incubator \\(37\u00b0C, CO2 5%, O2 5%) for 8 hours.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. Days 0, 6 p.m.  \r\n  a. warm at 37\u00b0C complete PRM and add 12 \u00b5l to each channel. Remove excess of exhausted medium from reservoirs.\r\n\n\nb. Incubate in Low oxygen incubator \\(37\u00b0C, CO2 5%, O2 5%) overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5. Days 1-5 \u2013 MET induction:\r\n  a. 9 a.m., check for nuclear EGFP \\(after first transfection expect >50% nEGFP+ cells)\r\n\n\nb. 9 a.m., proceed with transfection, as described in point 3. \r\n\n\nc. Starting from day 2, the amount of mmRNA transfected should be gradually increased only if fibroblasts appear healthy and proliferative. If cell population is steady and/or stressed, do not increase the amount of mmRNA transfected.\r\n\n\nd. The aim is to maximize mmRNA transfection efficiency, which can be estimated by looking at nuclear EGFP signal. At the same time excessive mmRNA amount could lead to cell stress and reduced proliferation.\r\n\n\ne. To increase mmRNA amount multiply by 1.25X, 1.5X or 1.75x the volumes indicated in point 3 \\(see Table 1). Typically, mmRNA amount is increased every second day, reaching the 1.75x amount by day 5-6.\r\n\n\nf. 6 p.m., add fresh complete PRM\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6. Days 6-12 \u2013 Na\u00efve Reprogramming completion: \r\n  a. Over the first 6 days fibroblasts should undergo Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition \\(MET) \\(see Figure 1e of Giulitti et al., 2018). If MET is not observed, iPSC colonies will very unlikely form, so we would suggest to restart the whole protocol. \r\n\n\nb. If MET is observed, cells should be exposed to RSeT medium rather than PRM, from Day 6 onwards.\r\n\n\nc. Calculate the amount of complete RSeT medium needed as done for PRM in point 2a. Add B18R \\(0.2 \u00b5g/ml) to RSeT and store complete RSeT at 4C for maximum 72 h.\r\n\n\nd. 9 a.m., prepare transfection, see point 3, using RSeT instead of PRM. \r\n\n\ne. Typically, the 1.75x dose of mmRNA is used from day 6 to the end of the reprogramming protocol \\(day 12).\r\n\n\nf. Small compact colonies should start to emerge from day 9 and become mature around day 12-14.\r\n\n\ng. In order to perform immunostaining of primary na\u00efve iPSC colonies we use a mmRNA mix without nEGFP from day 8. This allows EGFP clearance by day 12. \r\n\n\nh. 6 p.m., add 12 \u00b5l of warm B18R-supplemented RSeT medium to each channel.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7. Days 12-14 \u2013 Expansion of na\u00efve iPSC colonies out of the \u00b5F chip: \r\n  a. Wash twice with PBS-/- each channel containing na\u00efve iPSC colonies. Incubate cells with 12 \u00b5l Accutase \\(or TrypLE) for 3-7 min at room temperature. The timing depends on the number of cells remaining in the channel. In some cases, several colonies will form on top of a dense layer of unreprogrammed fibroblasts.\r\n\n\nb. When all cells are fully detached, add to each channel 12 \u00b5l of RSeT and collect cells from reservoir into a 1.5 ml microtube. Repeat this step until all cells have been collected.\r\n\n\nc. Add 1 ml RSeT with 10 \u00b5M RI to the 1.5 ml microtube and plate on inactivated MEF in a well of a 24-well plate. If reprogramming efficiency is low we suggest to pool together colonies from several \u00b5F channels to maximise the success of expansion of na\u00efve iPSC colonies.\r\n\n\nd. Add 0.6 ml of fresh RSeT medium every day and passage colonies every 3-5 days according to the size of colonies and level of proliferation.\r\n\n\ne. A split ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 should be used according to the number of colonies, their size and proliferation rate. The first two passages are critical to stabilise the na\u00efve iPSC line.\r\n\n\nf. We succeeded in generating a stable niPSC line starting from as little as 3 colonies, by passaging them every 5-6 days at a split ratio of 1:1. Conversely, starting from >50 colonies we obtained stable niPSC lines after 2 passages at a split ratio of 1:2 \u2013 1:3 every 3 days.\r\n\n\ng. Stable niPSC lines are routinely passaged every 3-4 days at a split ratio of 1:3 \u2013 1:4, with daily medium change under low oxygen condition on feeder cells.\r\n\n\nh. Na\u00efve pluripotent identity should be checked during expansion by quantitative real-time RT PCR and Immunostaining as described in Figures 2 and S2 of Giulitti et al., 2018."

            "content": "- Important: when a new batch of mmRNA is bought or produced it is important to test each mmRNA individually by transfection in human fibroblasts. After 4 days of transfection it should be possible to detect robust protein expression of the reprogramming factors by Western Blot or Immunostaining. We suggest to use hESCs or iPSCs as controls, as previously done \\(Luni et al., 2016; Warren et al., 2010).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- On day 0, the day after seeding of human fibroblast, make sure they look healthy and at the right density \\(Figure 2, a-c). If cells are too sparse or dense we recommend to repeat the seeding at different densities, ranging from 10 to 100 cells/mm2. For BJ human fibroblasts a seeding density of 25 cells/mm2 gave optimal results, but different cell lines might require different seeding densities.  If cells are too sparse they will be too stressed after transfection and stop proliferating, if too dense the transfection efficiency will be too low. If at day 0 cells are too sparse but homogeneously plated, it is possible to wait 1-2 additional days before transfection.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- If cells do not attach, or are not homogeneously plated \\(Figure 2b), make sure that the batch of Fibronectin used is of good quality and/or be more careful during injection of the cell suspension in the chip.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- At day 5 fibroblasts should have increased in number and be >90% nGFP positive \\(Figure 2, d-e). If not make sure that the right seeding density and dose of mmRNA was used.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- Keep the same transfection timing each day during the reprogramming to guarantee a sustained expression of mmRNAs.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- Fresh primary fibroblasts at low passage number will give better results. If part of the cell population has limited proliferative capacity, consider higher seeding densities before starting the protocol. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- Check for a proper water level inside the dish \\(>2 ml) every 3-4 days. A high humidity level is essential to avoid medium evaporation from the microfluidic chip.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- If no MET is observed by day 6, make sure that the right dose of mmRNA has been used, as low doses might allow high proliferation and survival, without inducing effective reprogramming. Conversely, MET might not occur if cells are senescent or too sparse during the first days. Figure 2 d-e shows ideal cell density after 5 days of transfection, with cells beginning to undergo MET. See also Figure 1e in Giulitti et al., 2018 for a representative timeline of a successful reprogramming experiment.    \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- If niPSC colonies at day 12 are still very small, we recommend keep them in the \u00b5F chip for 2-3 additional days, giving fresh medium every 12 hours, before expanding them out of the \u00b5F chips. Large niPSC colonies are more likely to expand after passaging."

In contrast to murine na\u00efve iPSCs, conventional human iPSCs are in a more developmentally advanced state called primed pluripotency. Here we report a detailed protocol for the generation of human na\u00efve iPSCs \\(niPSCs) from less than 1000 primary human somatic cells without stable genetic manipulation by delivery of modified messenger RNAs with microfluidics. Expression of OSKM in combination with NANOG for 12 days generates niPSCs that are free of transgenes, karyotypically normal, and display transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic features indicative of the na\u00efve state. Specifically, we describe the production of microfluidics chips, the reprogramming of somatic cells into niPSCs and their expansion out of the microfluidics chips. Our microfluidics approach will allow robust and cost-effective production of patient-specific niPSCs for regenerative medicine applications, including disease modelling and drug screening.",
