            "content": "Genetically modified crops producing insecticidal proteins from _Bacillus thuringiensis_ \\(Bt) for insect control have been planted on more than 200 million ha worldwide since 1996 \\[1].  Evolution of resistance by insect pests threatens the continued success of Bt crops \\[2, 3].  To delay pest resistance, refuges of non-Bt crops are planted near Bt crops to allow survival of susceptible pests \\[4, 5].   We used computer simulations of a population genetic model to determine if predictions from the theory underlying the refuge strategy match outcomes in the field documented with monitoring data \\[6].  The computer program is called SERBt for Simulated Evolution of Resistance to Bt crops.  For the six major pests modeled, the simulation results corresponded with the field data.  In particular, the simulations indicated that resistance would evolve fastest in _Helicoverpa zea_, a major cotton pest in the U.S., and this insect was the first with documented field-evolved resistance to a Bt crop.  The model can be readily modified to incorporate key biological parameters for many insects."

The values can be entered directly into the program code, but we find it is easier to manipulate the variables on the spreadsheet.  The best way to do this is to format the Input Screen as Follows \\(corresponds with code above):\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRow 3, Column A:  Initial s allele frequency \\(Value from 0 to 1)\r\n\n\nRow 3, Column B:  Initial r allele frequency \\(Value from 0 to 1; 1 \u2013 Initial s)\r\n\n\nRow 3, Column E:  Fitness of ss genotype in refuge \\(Value from 0 to 1)\r\n\n\nRow 3, Column F:  Fitness of rs genotype in refuge \\(Value from 0 to 1)\r\n\n\nRow 3, Column G:  Fitness of rr genotype in refuge \\(Value from 0 to 1)\r\n\n\nRow 3, Column J:  Fitness of ss genotype in Bt field \\(Value from 0 to 1)\r\n\n\nRow 3, Column K:  Fitness of rs genotype in Bt field \\(Value from 0 to 1)\r\n\n\nRow 3, Column L:  Fitness of rr genotype in Bt field \\(Value from 0 to 1)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRow 6, Column A:  Proportion Refuge \\(Value from 0 to 1)\r\n\n\nRow 6, Column E:  Number of generations per year \\(Integer greater than or equal to 1)\r\n\n\nRow 6, Column J:  Number of simulated years \\(Integer greater than or equal to 1)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe used Rows 1, 2, and 5 of the worksheet \"Input\" to label the variables.  No values from these rows are used as inputs to the program, but they are helpful for reference.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6)  To run the program in Microsoft Excel 2007, click on Macros \\(Button on developer tab).  BtResistance should be highlighted.  Click on run.  In earlier versions of excel, click on Run macro \\(Button on Visual Basic Toolbar). Bt resistance should be highlighted.  Click on run.  All output of the program is displayed on the worksheet \"Output\".  Note:  the program automatically replaces old output.  If you are in design mode the program will not work.  You can exit design mode using button on Visual Basic Toolbar.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7)  On future use of the program, when you open Excel, it will ask you about Macros.  Click \"Enable Macros\" upon opening Excel to use the program."
