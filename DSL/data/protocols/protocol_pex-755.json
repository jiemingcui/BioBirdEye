            "content": "All donated embryos in this study were surplus frozen embryos from couples who already had at least a healthy baby after IVF clinic treatment. The informed consent process for embryo donation compiled with International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation (2016) and Ethical Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell research (2003) jointly issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health of People\u2019s Republic of China.\nEmbryo thawing and zona pellucida removal\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before embryo thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 was equilibrated in a\n4-well plate overnight. 0.5 ml of G-2 medium was added to the well, and then 0.25 ml of mineral oil was used to cover the G2 medium.\nNote:\nThe G-2 medium must be pre-equilibrated in the incubator overnight or for at least 6 hours.\n2. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post-fertilization, d.p.f 5-6) were thawed using a Kitazato Thawing Media Kit by strictly following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n3. After culturing in drops of equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, the embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution to remove the zona pellucida.\nNote:\nThe Pasteur's pipette diameter should be larger than the embryo diameter to avoid damaging the embryos. No more than two embryos were treated in the acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution each time. Once the zona pellucida vanished, the embryos were immediately transferred to G-2 medium to avoid damage to the embryos by the acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution.\n4. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium for two times and then transferred to\nin vitro\nculture medium.\nEvaluation of embryo quality\nAccording to the Gardner\u2019s scoring system\n6\n, thawed blastocysts were given numerical scores from 1 to 6 based on their expansion degree and hatching status. The blastocyst with expansion and hatching status above 3 and with visible inner cell mass above grade B were included in the study. Based on morphologies, normal embryos had to meet the two following requirements: obvious expansion during culturing and absence of obviously dead or broken (fragmented) cell mass during development. Otherwise, they were excluded in this study.\nIn vitro\nthree-dimensional culture of human embryos\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The culture conditions were as follows: 37.2\u2103, 6% CO\n2\nand saturated humidity\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0150 \u00b5L/well mIVC1 was added to a low-attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) and the culture medium was pre-equilibrated for at least six hours\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day 5-6 embryos without zona pellucida were washed in pre- equilibrated mIVC1 three times and then transferred to a new well for each embryo\nNote:\nEmbryos should be washed at least 3 times in mIVC1 to remove the G-2 residue.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On day 6-8 post-fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was\nmIVC1\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by mIVC2\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells in mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel\nNote:\nMatrigel should be thawed at 4\u2103, and all operations should be performed on ice.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Afterwards, 50% of the culture medium was replaced with new mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.\nNote:\nThe time that the embryos are outside of the incubator should be minimized when replacing medium or taking photos. mIVC1 and mIVC2 should be pre-equilibrated in the incubator for at least six hours before use.\nEmbryo frozen section\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were fixed with 4% PFA for 40 mins in room temperature\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were washed three times in PBS in room temperature\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dehydrated with 15% sucrose for 1 min in room temperature\nNote:\nThe dehydration time can be extended appropriately if the sample does not sink\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were embedded in a plastic mold with O.C.T.\nNote:\nEmbryos should be washed in O.C.T three times before transferred to the mold\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The embedded embryos were sectioned by a Leica frozen slicer.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The slices were baked on a heating plate for 40 mins at 45 degree\u00a0centigrade\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The slices were stored in -20 refrigerator\nEmbryo section staining and taking photos\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryo sections were placed in dark box and washed with PBS three times\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Samples were permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes at room temperature\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash with PBS one time\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Samples were blocked by 3% BSA for 4 hours at room temperature\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash with PBS one time\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add primary antibodies with 1% BSA\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate primary antibodies overnight in a 4\u2103 refrigerator.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Samples were washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS for three times, 3-5mins per time\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add secondary antibodies with PBS for 2 hours at room temperature\n10.\u00a0Samples were washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS for three times, 3-5 mins per time\n11.\u00a0Cover slips were covered with 50% glycerine\n12.\u00a0Taking photos by Leica SP8\nNote:\nSamples must be kept moist all the time and without drying out\nWhole embryo staining and taking photos\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were fixed with 4% PFA in a normal 96-well plate, 200 \u00b5L/well, 40 mins in room temperature\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were transferred to a new well with 200\u00b5L PBS\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were transferred to a new well with 200\u00b5L 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 hours\nin room temperature\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were transferred to a new well with 200\u00b5L 3% BSA for 4 hours in room temperature\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were transferred to a new well with 100\u00b5L primary antibody diluted by\n1% BSA\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate primary antibodies overnight in a 4\u2103 refrigerator\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS for three times, 15 mins per time\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were transferred to a new well with 100\u00b5L secondary antibody diluted by\nPBS\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryos were washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS for three times, 15 mins per time\n10.\u00a0Embryos were washed with 50% glycerine and transferred to 8-well IbiTreat \u00b5 plates to take photos\n11.\u00a0To make the 3D videos, embryos were mounted in on aqueous solution of 80% glycerol, and a multi-photon microscope (Leica TCS SP8 DIVE) was used to take photos.\nIsolation of single cells\n1. Three drops of 30 \u00b5L 0.25% trypsin were added on a 35mm petri dish (Corning, 351008), 3 mL mineral oil was covered on the trypsin for each dish\n2. The dishes were incubated in a 37\u2103 incubator for 30 mins\n3. Embryos were washed in PBS 3 times\nNote:\nWash the embryo at least 3 times to remove the residue of medium\n4.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Human embryogenesis is not well understood. Knowledge detailing human pre-gastrulation embryonic development including spatial self-organization and cell type ontogeny remains limited by available two-dimensional technological platforms. Here, we present a three-dimensional (3D) blastocyst-culture system, which enables human blastocyst development through primitive streak anlage (PSA). By the 3D-platform combined with immunofluorescence imaging and single-cell RNA-Seq, we reveal a developmental landscape of human pre-gastrulation embryos. Our protocol allows recording and analysis of embryo developmental landmarks and mechanisms from human blastocysts to pre-gastrulation stage (day 14 post- fertilization).</p>",
