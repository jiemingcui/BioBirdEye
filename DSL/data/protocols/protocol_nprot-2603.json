            "content": "Chemotypic heterogeneity among species may not permit optimal DNA yields from one isolation protocol, and perhaps even closely related species may require different isolation strategies. The problem encountered due to co isolation of highly viscous polysaccharides, degradation of DNA due to endonuclease, inhibitor compounds like polyphenols and other secondary metabolites which directly or indirectly interfere with enzymatic reactions<sup>1, 2, 3</sup>. Since the DNA extraction method was first reported by Marmur<sup>4</sup> in 1961 using SDS and chloroform, scientists have been devoting themselves to the improvement and simplification of DNA extraction methods using either SDS or CTAB with specialized apparatus<sup>5, 6, 7, 8</sup>. However, these procedures may only work for a limited number of tissue or plant species, and most are still multi step procedures. Here we present a simple, quick and low-cost method adaptable to standard laboratory conditions to isolate high-quality DNA from heterogeneous plant materials both in terms of origin and identity."

Transfer the homogenate to 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube and vortex for 30 seconds after adding of 10% SDS solution.\r\n  3. Incubate the tube in a water bath at 65\u00b0C for 20-40 minutes and mix the contents 2-3 times by inverting the tubes. Centrifuge at 17,000 rpm for 10 minutes, which separates the homogenate into two parts.\r\n  4. Take the upper aqueous phase into a new tube and mix with an equal volume of phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol \\(25:24:1, v/v/v). Shake the tube well for 5 minutes and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes. \r\n  5. Collect the supernatant into a fresh tube and add 1/5\nth\nvolume 2 M NaCl and 2 volume pre-chilled ethanol. Keep the tube at -20\u00baC for 10 minutes to precipitate DNA.\r\n  6. Spool the DNA and transfer to another tube. Wash the spooled DNA with 70% ethanol \\(2-3 times) and air dry under laminar flow chamber for 10-15 minutes. \r\n  7. Dissolve the dry pellet in nuclease free water or TE buffer \\(pH 8.0). Store DNA at 4\u00baC or -20\u00baC."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "This method is designed to recover utmost amount of DNA from heterogeneous plant tissues restraining the co-extraction of PCR inhibiting substances. It requires maceration of plant tissue of about 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> in DNA extraction buffer \\[200 mM Tris-HCl \\(pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl and 25 mM EDTA, and 1% PVP], followed by cell lysis with 10% SDS. The lysate was treated with Phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol \\(25:24:1) efficiently removes all chaotropic cellular materials except water soluble polysaccharides which concomitantly excluded by DNA precipitation with ethanol and sodium chloride. It needs about one and half an hour to prepare DNA to perform thousands of PCR-based reactions and other DNA manipulation techniques. This method does not require liquid nitrogen and also bypass RNase treatment. It can be performed even in low technology laboratories.",
