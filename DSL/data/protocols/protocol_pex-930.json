            "content": "<p>Following the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to cause a global pandemic in early 2020, several serological tests have been developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 are typically small plastic cassettes to which is added patient whole blood or serum followed by buffer solution and qualitative results made available via a chromotographic lateral flow assay. Positive tests from different manufacturers are designed to be read as either a total antibody reaction (single line) or as an IgM, IgG split antibody reaction (two separate lines). In addition, a control line must be apparent to ensure validity of result read.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This protocol provides instruction to carry out rapid diagnostic, point-of-care (POC) serology testing for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by the pathogen Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It aims to enable evaluation of point-of-care (POC) antibody test kits against the current gold-standard of PCR. Where this has been conducted specifically in a UK based-inpatient cohort, results are therefore not intended for extrapolation to the general population.</p><p><br></p><p>This study was deemed a verification of a CE marked in vitro diagnostic test by the Research and Development Office at Chelsea &amp; Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom.</p>"

            "content": "Patient selection\nConsecutive inpatients presenting to hospital and requiring admission, that subsequently test positive with real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (AusDiagnostics\u00ae, Australia), will be selected for testing and stratified based on duration of symptoms. All samples will be tested using patient whole blood by the same dedicated research team. Product inserts report whole blood, serum or plasma as suitable samples for testing.\nInclusion criteria\nTo be included in the study patients will have been admitted to hospital with symptoms matching the PHE case definition for testing,\n2\nand have an accurate history recorded of at least 5 days of symptoms.\nExclusion criteria\nThe following patients will not be eligible to be included in the study: 1) all patients under 16 years old; 2) mild infection not requiring admittance to hospital; 3) patients who are unable to provide an accurate history of PHE case definition symptoms or those with vague onset of symptom duration.\nInitial study (n=15)\nFor each patient identified a unique identifier, general demographics (including age, sex), symptoms reported at presentation, days since symptom onset, day of PCR testing, result of PCR test, and day of POC testing are all to be recorded.\n15 SARS-CoV-2 CE marked split IgM/IgG antibody tests (Core tests\u00ae) will be paired alongside 15 SARS-CoV-2 CE marked total antibody rapid tests (Wantai), 15 COVID-19 CE marked split IgM/IgG Rapid Tests (VivaDiag), 15 COVID-19 CE marked split IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassettes (OrientGene), and 15 SARS-CoV-2 CE marked split IgM/IgG One Step Rapid Test Devices (Encode).\n10 PCR positive that meet inclusion criteria are to be selected. Each POC kit will be run on the same blood sample at the same time, taken on the day of testing. Positive cases will be selected to reflect an array of times since symptom onset from 5-14 days in order to inform as a screen for a minimum time point at which reaction POC testing in known PCR positive patients appears to become concordant. False positive reactivity will be evaluated by testing true negative patients (estimate 5) using all available kits in the same manner.\nThe same research team will test each patient, as per each product protocol. Test kits will be read at the designated time period as per individual protocol and both the appearance of a control line and the presence or absence of antibody test reactivity lines will be recorded. All test readings will be verified independently by two of the researchers.\nFurther study (n=200)\nA larger study is to then be conducted utilising a single test kit. In this case the COVID-19 CE marked split IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassettes (OrientGene) is to be used. Patients are to be stratified based on consecutive PCR positive results to one of three time interval groups since symptom onset: days 5-9, 10-14, and more than 14 days (150). A further 50 patients are to be tested that are considered negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, either secondary to negative PCR testing or radiological imaging demonstrating no signs indicative of COVID-19 and an alternative primary febrile diagnosis.\nFive test cassettes will be used to pilot and evaluate possible anticipated end-user difficulties. Three test cassettes will be used to retest a patient with a positive result to comment on reproducibility. One test cassette will be completed with too little blood, failing to fill the pipette to the indicated line and one test cassette will be completed with too much blood, by over-filling the well.\nPrevalence calculations have been estimated in the general population for the UK during the same testing period.\n3\nHospital inpatient prevalence should be calculated for the appropriate time period and used as a marker of prevalence for the testing cohort across the same period of testing. Prevalence calculations are to be used to inform positive and negative predictive values in the general population and when utilised in specific patient populations.\nSample collection\nEach of the kits in this protocol can be performed using whole blood (including EDTA, sodium citrate or heparin samples), serum or plasma specimens.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Testing should be performed immediately following collection if possible.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Samples can be stored for a limited period of time (Encode, Core tests\u00ae 2-8\no\nC for 5 days or long term storage at -20\no\nC; Wantai 2-8\no\nC for 7 days or long term storage at -15\no\nC; OrientGene 2-8\no\nC for 3 days or for long term storage at less than -20\no\nC\u00a0VivaDiag\u2122 no comment made).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If delayed testing is conducted, samples should be brought back to room temperature for 15 minutes prior to testing.\nPreparing the Test\nEach manufacturer instructions must be followed for the individual test kit used. The overall technique remains the same regardless of manufacturer.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ensure you are wearing the correct PPE for carrying out the test in the extraction hood in the laboratory.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gather the materials required\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Double check the name, hospital number, and date of birth for each patient included in the study.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cross check the blood sample bottle with the day since symptom onset data for each patient to ensure the sample is the correct date.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ensure the test kit is within date and not damaged, record LOT number and date of expiry for each test used.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove the test cassette from the packaging and label it with serial number of the patient.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place horizontally on a flat surface.\nPerforming the Test\nFamiliarise yourself with the manufacturers guidelines for the brand of RDT being used. Test read time is specific for each cassette but typically ranges from 10-15 minutes. The following details that are particular to each RDT used in this study.\nGeneral instructions:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each RDT has its own plastic pipette for transferring sample (whole blood/plasma/serum) from the collection vial to the specimen well. Use the RDT specific cassette for each test.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having completed your preparations, remove the cap from the identified collection vial.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using the RDT specific pipette, transfer the requisite amount of sample from the vial to the designated specimen window. Place cap back on vial and return to storage rack. Discard plastic pipette into a biohazard waste container.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immediately add the requisite amount of buffer solution to the appropriate well (see RDT specific instructions/RDT instruction leaflet) from a vertical position above the well.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start the timer.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Read and record the result (serial number recorded on the cassette).\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discard the cassette into a biohazard waste container.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do not read cassettes beyond the designated time period."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic, causing over 3,600,000 reported cases and 250,000 deaths worldwide.<sup>1</sup> Case identification has predominantly been made by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during the acute phase and largely restricted to healthcare laboratories. Serological assays are emerging but independent validation is urgently required to assess their utility. </p><p><br></p><p>Where a plurality of point-of-care (POC) SARS-CoV-2 antibody test kits have become available, we will therefore aim to evaluate a range of kits against the current available gold-standard diagnostic test of PCR in an initial, exploratory study. We will then proceed to carry out testing with 200 hospital inpatients using the OrientGene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette against PCR in order to undergo a preliminary evaluation of POC serological test performance characteristics within a hospital inpatient cohort.</p>",
