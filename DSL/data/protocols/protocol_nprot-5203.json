            "content": "This protocol is used for the _in_ _vivo_ DMS-based chemical probing of RNA structure genome-wide from _S. cerevisiae_ or human cells in culture, providing quantitative RNA structure data encoded as mismatches. In the first step, cells/tissues are treated with DMS, followed by total RNA extraction, and fragmentation. After ligation to a 3\u2019 adaptor and rRNA depletion, the RNA is reverse transcribed using the thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase \\(TGIRT), which encodes structure-specific DMS modifications as mismatches in the cDNA. The cDNA is then circularized and subject to a limited number of PCR cycles before sequencing on an Illumina platform. The data produced has a high signal-to-noise ratio which compares favorably to the existing sequencing-based RNA structure probing techniques currently available<sup>1,2</sup>."

In vivo dimethyl sulfate \\(DMS) modification**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Cautions before working with DMS:**\r\n\n\nDMS is highly toxic and should only be used in a well-ventilated fume hood. We recommend using multiple layers of nitrile gloves such that the exterior layer can be removed and replaced after handling DMS directly. DMS should have a faint yellow color, that will grow darker due to oxidation over time. Open a fresh bottle of DMS every six months to ensure freshness and optimal reactivity. DMS will be quenched during the following procedure by BME and resulting liquid waste should be disposed of per your local hazardous waste regulations. With the exception of the centrifugation steps and final steps of total RNA extraction, all steps should be done in a fume hood.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\na. _S. cerevisiae_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Dilute saturated overnight yeast cultures to OD600 of ~0.09, and grow at 30\u00b0C to a final log phase OD600 of 0.5-0.7 at the time of DMS treatment.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Pre-chill a 30 ml stop solution on ice for > 1 hour before DMS treatment. Stop solution contains 15 ml 100% isoamyl alcohol, 9 ml BME, and 6 ml ddH2O. Also prepare and pre-chill a 10 ml wash solution containing 3 ml BME and 7 ml ddH2O. \\(Solutions will phase separate, invert to mix directly before using.)\r\n\n\n\u2022 Move 15 ml of log-phase yeast culture into a 50 ml conical and place in a rack submerged in a 30\u00b0C water bath, such that the entire 15 ml culture is just submerged.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Pipet 750 \u00b5l of DMS \\(5% v/v) into the yeast culture, stirring immediately stirring with a serological pipet. Treat the yeast for 4 min, with consistent stirring or swirling of the culture. Culture should remain submerged in the water bath during this time.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Pour ice cold 30 ml stop solution into yeast culture with DMS, cap, invert to mix, and place on ice. The DMS will be fully hydrolyzed by the BME at this point.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Centrifuge 50 ml conical for 4 min at 3,500 x g at 4\u00b0C. Optional: parafilm the lids to minimize the smell of DMS if centrifuge is located outside of a fume hood.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Decant supernatant into DMS/BME waste, will have a small pellet of yeast at the bottom. Pour in ice-cold wash solution, and shake/pipet to resuspend yeast pellet.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Parafilm lid \\(optional) and spin again for 4 min at 3,500 x g at 4\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Decant supernatant into waste. Residual wash solution remaining in tube is fine, and traces of remaining BME in tube will quench any remaining DMS released upon cell lysis.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 0.6 ml total RNA lysis buffer \\(6 mM EDTA, 45 mM NaOac pH 5.5) to tube and resuspend yeast pellet by pipet. Move sample to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube that contains 40 \u00b5l 20% SDS. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Prewarm 0.65 ml of acid phenol in thermomixer at 65\u00b0C. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Move tube with yeast/SDS mixture to 65\u00b0C thermomixer and shake at 1,400 rpm for 30 sec to ensure mixing of SDS.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add yeast sample to tube with hot acid phenol. Incubate in thermomixer at 65\u00b0C, shaking for 2 min at 1,400 rpm. Note, that DMS-treated RNA can be brittle and high temperature or vortexing steps should be minimized to prevent fragmentation.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Immediately move samples into a dry ice / EtOH bath \\(\n1:1 composition) until frozen,\n3 min.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Spin tubes 3 min at 20,000 x g at room temp and immediately remove top aqueous phase into new 1.5 ml tube, avoiding material at the phase interface.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 0.65 ml acid phenol \\(room temperature) to aqueous phase. Incubate at room temperature in thermomixer for 2-3 min, shaking at 1400 rpm.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Spin tubes 3 min at 20,000 x g at room temp and immediately remove top aqueous phase into new 1.5 ml tube, avoiding material at the phase interface.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 0.65 ml RNase-free chloroform and vortex at room temperature in thermomixer for 30 sec. Spin tubes 2 min at 20,000 x g at room temp and immediately remove top aqueous phase into new 1.5 ml tube, avoiding material at the phase interface.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add >1 volume isopropanol \\(ex. 700 \u00b5l) to final aqueous phase. Invert to mix well and chill >30min at -30\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Spin >45 min at 20,000 x g at 4\u00b0C to pellet nucleic acids.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Remove supernatant and wash pellet in 0.75 ml 70-80% EtOH.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Pulse spin tube to collect residual EtOH at the bottom, and remove all liquid with small pipet tip.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Air-dry 5 min and resuspend in 50 \u00b5l 10 mM Tris pH 7.0. May need to add additional volume if the pellet is large.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Nanodrop a 1:10 or 1:100 dilution of RNA sample. Procedure should yield >50-100 ug RNA.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nb. Adherent human cells\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Begin with a 15 cm2 plate of fully adherent HEK 293T cells in 15 ml media \\(other adherent cell lines will work with the procedure too). \r\n\n\n\u2022 Working a fume hood, remove 10 ml media from the plate into a 50 ml conical and add 200-300 \u00b5l DMS. Shake vigorously to ensure mixing.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Slowly pipette the DMS/media mixture back on the plate by tilting the plate and pipetting into a corner. Note that this step has to be done very carefully to avoid lifting cells from the plate. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Parafilm the plate, and move it to a 37\u00b0C incubator / hybridization oven for 5 min, keeping the plate in a fume hood if possible and swirling occasionally. Some cells may become detached during treatment.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Slowly pipet out the DMS/media into waste.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 10 ml of 30% v/v BME \\(diluted in 1 x PBS) and collect the cells into a 15 ml conical using a scraper to scrape the cells from the plate.  \r\n\n\n\u2022 Centrifuge cells at 1000 x g at 4\u00b0C for 3 min; decant the BME solution. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Wash the cells by adding 10 ml of 1 x PBS and repeating the centrifugation step. Decant the PBS. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 1 ml Trizol to plate, lysing cells, and extracting total RNA according to the Trizol protocol \\(Optional: if using higher amounts of DMS you may add 10 \u00b5l 100% BME to the Trizol).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2. Fragmentation**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022  Start with 10 \u00b5g of RNA in 9 \u00b5l 10 mM Tris pH 7.0 in a 0.2 ml PCR tube for a 10 \u00b5l final reaction volume.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Move tube to thermocycler for 2 min at 95\u00b0C to denature the RNA.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Move tube directly to ice. Add 1 \u00b5l Ambion Fragmentation Reagent, immediately pipetting up and down to mix well.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Move tube back to 95\u00b0C thermocycler for 1 min 40 sec. Move to ice.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 1 \u00b5l of Ambion Fragmentation Reagent Stop Solution, which contains EDTA to quench the Zn2+ in the fragmentation reagent. As before, pipet up and down to mix well.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 10 \u00b5l of 2x TBE-Urea Sample Buffer, mix by flicking.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Load all of sample/dye mix into well of a 6% TBE-Urea gel.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Run gel 45 min at 150 V.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Stain gel in 1x SYBR Gold, image on a blue light, and cut RNA fragments of 100-170 nucleotides in size, which removes small RNA contaminants of <100 nucleotides \\(e.g. tRNAs).\r\n\n\n\u2022 To extract RNA from gel slice, nest a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube with two holes poked in to the bottom of the smaller tube using a 20-gauge needle.

Generating libraries with larger fragment inserts is possible, but may require a scaling of input material given high loss during protocol steps, such as inefficiencies in gel extraction for larger fragment sizes. Generally, it may be preferable to use T4 PNK for 3\u2019 end healing instead of rSAP to also resolve cyclic phosphates after fragmentation. The preferred T4 PNK conditions would be 30 min at 37\u00b0C in reaction conditions: 100 mM Tris/acetate pH 6.0, 3 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT."

Based on the RNA structure-specific _in_ _vivo_ chemical modification by DMS and the encoding of resultant modifications as mismatches during reverse transcription, DMS-MaPseq produces ratiometric RNA structure data that does not require base-by-base correction to control samples. Due to its high signal-to-noise ratio, DMS-MaPseq is the preeminent choice amongst mutational profiling techniques. Here we describe the genome-wide DMS-MaPseq protocol, which produces libraries suitable for Illumina sequencing and can be applied across many model systems.",
