            "content": "In the past decade, _in vitro_ reconstitution of biological processes from component molecules has been regarded as a powerful approach to uncover the underlying design principles of cells<sup>1</sup>. This bottom-up approach enables independent, precise control of biochemical parameters, such as protein composition and concentration, and physical parameters, such as boundary conditions and system size. Thus, the minimal necessary components and specific physical conditions essential for realizing biological functions can be identified.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHere, we present a simple protocol for encapsulating purified proteins into cell-sized water-in-oil droplets surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer to mimic the cell boundary. This water-in-oil droplet system has been extensively utilized to investigate the effects of cellular microenvironments on various biological processes, including the self-organization of cytoskeletal architecture<sup>2\u20138</sup> and gene expression<sup>9,10</sup>. We adopted this system to elucidate the direct contribution of the cellular boundary to the assembly of the cytokinetic ring, and clarified that actin filaments and myosin motors can self-organize into ring-shaped contractile bundles when they are confined to a cell-sized spherical space, even without spatiotemporal regulatory signals<sup>11</sup>. The protocol described below was according to our previous reports<sup>11,12</sup>."

Dispense the lipid solution into glass test tubes \\(50 \u03bcL per tube).\r\n  3. Place the test tubes in a vacuum desiccator.\r\n  4. Evacuate overnight at room temperature in the dark to completely remove chloroform \\(Fig. 1a).\r\n  5. Store lipid dry films in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature in the dark. The lipid dry films should be used within 1 month.\r\n  \r\n\n\nTips: Phospholipids should be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere in the dark.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PREPARATION OF LIPID-OIL MIXTURE**\r\n\n\n6. Mix mineral oil by gentle inversion just before use.\r\n  7. Collect a lipid dry film sample from a vacuum desiccator.\r\n  8. Place 1 mL of mineral oil into the glass test tube.\r\n  9. Seal the top of the tube with a heat-resistant sealing film \\(Fig. 1b).\r\n  10. Incubate the tube at 80 \u00b0C for ~15 min in a dry bath incubator.\r\n  11. Dissolve the lipid dry film by vortexing \\(~10 s; Fig. 1c).\r\n  12. If the lipid dry film remains at the bottom of the tube, repeat steps 10 and 11.\r\n  13. Set the tube in a floating rack and float in a water bath sonicator.\r\n  14. Sonicate the tube for 90 min at 60 \u00b0C and 60 W power \\(Fig. 1d).\r\n  15. Immediately after sonication, mix the lipid-oil mixture by vortexing \\(~10 s).\r\n  16. Cool to room temperature and incubate overnight at room temperature in the dark.\r\n  17. The concentration of lipids in oil is 1 mM. Store the lipid-oil mixture at room temperature in the dark, and use within 1 week of preparation.\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PREPARATION OF A FLOW CHAMBER**\r\n\n\n18. Place two pieces of double-sided adhesive tape \\(thickness:\n100 \u03bcm) onto a silicone-coated coverslip with a\n8 mm gap between them.\r\n  19. Place a normal coverslip on top of the gap, to produce a chamber of 18 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm \\(see Fig. 2c).\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**ENCAPSLATION OF PROTEINS INTO WATER-IN-OIL DROPLETS**\r\n\n\n20. Mix lipid-oil mixture by vortexing immediately before use.\r\n  21. Transfer 80 \u03bcL of the lipid-oil mixture into a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube pre-equilibrated to a desired temperature.\r\n  22. Pipet 2 \u03bcL of protein solution directly into the lipid-oil mixture in the microcentrifuge tube \\(Fig. 2a).\r\n  23. Mix the lipid-oil mixture and protein solutions by vortexing for 10\u201330 s to form water-in-oil droplets \\(Fig. 2b). The droplet size can be controlled by optimizing the power and duration of vortexing.\r\n  24. Perfuse the water-in-oil emulsion into a flow chamber \\(Fig. 2c).\r\n  25. Seal the flow chamber with Valap \\(Fig. 2d).\r\n  26. Observe the water-in-oil droplets using an optical microscope \\(Fig. 3)."
