Successfully conjugated and purified antibody-oligo complexes should appear as a high molecular weight smear with some laddering which entirely collapses to an oligo band upon reduction.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nVerify that ADT library does not contain any cDNA PCR primer carryover amplification products:\r\n\n\nA TSO-RT-oligo product \\(~140 bp) can be amplified during the ADT PCR by carryover primers from cDNA amplification. The product will not cluster but will interfere with quantification. Sequential 2X SPRI purification of the ADT fraction after cDNA amplification reduces carryover of primers from cDNA amplification, and minimizes the amplification of this product during ADT-library amplification. A clean ADT library will contain a predominant single peak at around 180 bp.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAntibody concentration might have to be titrated using methods established for state of the art flow cytometry.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn our proof of principle experiments we conjugated biotinylated oligos containing a disulfide bond at the 5' end to streptavidin labelled antibodies. The disulfide bond allows separation of the oligo from the antibody with reducing agents. Separation of the oligo from the antibody may not be needed for all applications or may even be disadvantageous. Non-cleavable oligos might reduce the efficiency of template switching. In this case, or when using scRNA-seq protocols which do not include template switching, an optional CITE-seq antibody PCR handle oligo \\(see below) can be added to the cDNA amplification reactions at very low amounts \\(~2pmol) to ensure amplification of the ADTs.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOptional_ADT_cDNA_amp_oligo_v2: 5'CCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCC"
