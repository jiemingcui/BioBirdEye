            "content": "<p>The ruminant production systems around the world are strongly based on the intake of forages. In addition, it is known that climatic conditions (mainly temperature and rainfall distribution) influence the growth and productivity of pastures. Hence, changes of climate conditions across the year, determine the availability of forages with adequate nutritional quality for ruminant production. This condition may impair ruminant health, production, and reproduction. Thus, the use of forage conservation techniques is a common strategy in livestock systems to overcome this limitation.</p><p>One of the most common forage preservation techniques uses a combination of both anaerobic and acidic environments. This technique is known as ensiling and the feedstuff produced is defined as silage. The ensiling process intends to preserve the nutritional quality of the original forage or vegetal feed source, extending the nutritional availability of forage to different periods in the year.</p><p>The nutritional quality of silages can be evaluated using different parameters. Among these parameters, the evaluation of the short-chain fatty acids (SFCAs) profile constitutes a suitable choice for quality evaluation due to the SFCAs profile and the nutritional composition of the silage are correlated.</p><p>In silages, the SFCAs profile may be composed of lactic, acetic, propionic, butyric, iso-butyric, 2-methyl butyric, valeric, isovaleric, caproic, and caprylic acids, whose concentrations may vary according to the forage source, as well as potential physical or chemical treatments applied during ensiling. Hence, this protocol aimed to describe a method to extract, identify, and quantify SFCAs in silages, using RP-HPLC-DAD as a quantification technique.</p>"

Weigh 10 g fresh silage and transfer to glass jar blender.\n3. Add 100 mL of Milli-Q water (measured using a class A volumetric pipette) to the glass jar blender.\n4. Blend the mixture during 30s at an intermediate rate.\n5. Filtrate the resulting mixture using a PYREX\u2122 Gooch Type Filtering Crucible and vacuum filtration equipment. Keep the liquid filtrate.\n6. Transfer 2 mL of the filtrate to 6 mL plastic centrifugation tubes and add 2 mL of extraction solution (see 3.1 section).\n7. Vortex the mixture during 30s at an intermediate rate.\n8. Centrifugate the mixture at 10,000 x G for 15 min at 4 \u00baC.\n9. Recover a portion of the liquid phase after centrifugation using a plastic syringe and filter it through a 0.45 \u03bcm PES membrane filter, collecting a minimum of 500 uL of the filtrate in a chromatographic vial.\n5.2 Chromatographic analysis:\n5.2.1 Chromatographic analysis of the calibration curves (lactic acid and SCFAs):\n1. Prepare the calibration curves for lactic acid and SCFAs as described in sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, respectively (reagents).\n2. Analyze each point of the calibration curve using RP-HPLC-DAD.\n3. Identify and integrate the resulting chromatographic peaks.\n5.2.2 Chromatographic analysis of silage extract samples:\n1. Place 500 \u03bcL of the final extract in a chromatographic vial.\n2. Analyze using RP-HPLC-DAD.\n3. Identify and integrate the resulting chromatographic peaks.\n5.2.3 Chromatographic conditions:\n- Column temperature: 30 \u00baC.\n- Injection volume: 20 \u03bcL.\n- Stationary phase: Hypersil GOLD C18 column (dimensions: 150 x 4.6 mm) equipped with Hypersil GOLD C18 guard column (dimensions: 10 x 4 mm).\n- Working wavelength: 210 nm.\n- Mode: gradient, constant flow: 0.750 mL/min (Figure 3).\nNote: According to the literature findings, the most suitable column for SCFAs chromatographic separation by HPLC-DAD is an ion-exchange column. However, the Hypersil GOLD C18 column allows an efficient SCFAs separation, except for butyric and iso-butyric acids. This condition may constitute a limitation of the Hypersil GOLD C18 column use for SCFAs determination. However, considering that the concentration of iso-butyric acid is significantly lower in silages, a good estimation of butyric acid can be obtained with the reported method herein."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Short-chain fatty acid profile (SCFAs) in silage provides significant information regarding its fermentative patter in the rumen. Thus, we developed a protocol to extract, identify, and quantify the SCFAs of silages. The proposed method was tested with satisfactory results in corn silages. Despite literature findings suggest that the most common instrumental method for determining SCFAs is the gas chromatography technique, the liquid chromatography technique using both C18 column and ion-exchange columns can be proposed as analytical technique for SCFAs determination as well. The use of the C18 column in HPLC-DAD has a particular limitation because it does not allow efficient separation of butyric and iso-butyric acids. However, considering that the concentration of iso-butyric acid in silages is significantly lower than that of butyric acid, a good estimation of butyric acid can be obtained.</p>",
