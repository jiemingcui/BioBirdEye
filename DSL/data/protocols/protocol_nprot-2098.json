            "content": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\n\nAlthough isolation of adult mouse cardiomyocytes can be effectively performed, fixing them intact and immunocytochemical analysis using imaging techniques, which includes confocal microscopy is complicated <sup>1-3</sup>. Except for a few isolated studies in the past decade, very few have reported a reliable protocol to fix and stain isolated cardiomyocytes <sup>1,2</sup>. The importance of cytoskeletal proteins and organellar distribution like the mitochondria within the cardiomyocytes and how they vary in disease states is well-recognized <sup>3-9</sup>. This being the case, it is important to study associated changes occurring in different proteins within the cardiomyocytes, like the cytoskeletal proteins- desmin, actin, alpha- and beta-tubulins, dystrophin and organelles like mitochondrial distribution, ER, Golgi and nucleus within the cells. This makes fixing of isolated cardiomyocyte critical without causing distortion to the morphology and internal organization.\r\n\n\nWe propose a reproducible protocol for fixing isolated adult cardiomyocytes from mouse and making them attach to coverglass and successfully image using confocal microscopy. This improved and modified method would be a valuable tool to observe cardiomyocytes for various fluorescently labeled structural proteins and organelles even after fixing."

Dissolve 4g PFA in 100 ml PBS. \u25b2CRITICAL STEP This solution must be made fresh. To dissolve the PFA efficiently, heat the solution to ~70 \u00b0C under constant stirring with a magnetic stirrer in a fume hood. Cool the PFA solution, filter it to avoid precipitates in the fixative.\r\n\n\n\uf0a7 Coating chambered coverglass with Cell Tak cell adhesive:\r\n\n\nCoat the chambered coverglass with Cell Tak adhesive \\(1.7 \u00b5g/mm2). From the size and number of vessels to be coated, calculate total surface area. The best density of BD Cell-Tak depends on specific application, or cell type. A\r\n\n\npreliminary dose-response experiment is recommended to determine optimal density. High densities will not necessarily improve performance, so the \u201cminimum effective density\u201d should be determined empirically. Dilute the correct amount of BD Cell-Tak into the buffer, mix thoroughly, and dispense within 10 minutes. \u25b2CRITICAL STEP If the pH in the coating buffer is not between 6.5 - 8.0, Cell-Tak will not perform optimally. An aid to attaining this pH window is to use a volume of 1N NaOH equal to half the volume Cell-Tak solution used in combination with a neutral buffer. For example: Use 10 \u03bcl Cell-Tak, 285 \u03bcl Sodium Bicarbonate, pH 8.0 and 5 \u03bcl 1N NaOH \\(added immediately before coating) to make 300 \u03bcl Cell-Tak solution. A minimum incubation of 20 min is recommended, but longer times will not adversely affect adsorption, even if all the liquid evaporates. Pour off, or aspirate, the Cell-Tak and wash with sterile water to remove bicarbonate. If vessels are to be used later, they should be airdried and stored at 2-8 \u00baC up to two weeks or with dessicant up to 4 weeks."

Barry \\(Cardiology Division, University of Utah, Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, USA) and were isolated from 129S6 wild type mice \\(Taconic Laboratories) according to previously reported methods\n10\n\\(Note: As this protocol deals with immunocytochemisry and confocal microscopic imaging, isolation of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes is not elaborated).\r\n\n\n**2\u2502** Suspend the isolated cardiomyocytes in culture medium composed of 5% fetal bovine serum, 47.5% MEM, 47.5% modified Tyrode\u2019s solution, 10 mM pyruvic acid, 4.0 mM HEPES, and 6.1 mM glucose. Maintain the cells in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 30 \u00baC until use.\r\n\n\n**3\u2502** Label the cells with MitoTracker Deep Red 633 for staining mitochondria \\(100 nm in the culture medium, M-22426, Molecular Probes) and incubate for 30 min while at the CO2 incubator \u25b2CRITICAL STEP staining for mitochondria should be done in live myocytes as the MitoTracker will stain mitochondria only when it is alive. The concentration and timing for staining should be standardized by the end user.\r\n\n\n**4\u2502** Wash the cells with PBS twice and resuspend in fresh PBS \u25b2CRITICAL STEP All the steps after labeling with MitoTracker should be performed in the dark or by covering the tubes containing the cells with aluminum foil to avoid photo-bleaching of the dye.\r\n\n\n**5\u2502** **Fixing and processing of cardiomyocytes for immunocytochemistry:**\r\n\n\nPellet the isolated cardiomyocytes using low g force \\(300 g for 1 min, 30 \u00baC). Suspended the pelleted cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS maintained at 30 \u00baC and fix for 30 mins with gentle mixing of the contents by inverting the tube using a nutating mixer. \u25b2CRITICAL STEP  It is important to maintain the cells at 30 \u00baC when they are viable and centrifuged at low g force to pellet cardiomyocytes, since these would affect cell viability and morphology.\r\n\n\n?Troubleshooting\r\n\n\n**6\u2502** After fixing, pellet down the cells \\(300 g for 1 min) and resuspend in PBS.\r\n\n\n 7\u2502Layer the cells over chambered cover glass coated with Cell-Tak cell and tissue adhesive. \u25b2CRITICAL STEP Adhering the cardiomyocytes to the chambered coverglass is a difficult process due to its size, and it is important to coat the cover glass with a cell adhesive.\r\n\n\n**8\u2502** Leave the fixed cells layered over the chambered cover glass undisturbed for 2 hours at room temperature. Once the fixed cells settle to the glass surface, wash the non-adherent cells using PBS.\r\n\n\n**9\u2502** **Permeabilization of cardiomyocyte using Triton X-100:**\r\n\n\n Permeabilize the fixed cardiomyocytes which are adhered to the Cell Tak coated cover glass surface using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS \\(v/v) for 3 min at room temperature. Wash the cells with PBS \\(2 x 2 min) and process for immunostaining.\r\n\n\n**10\u2502** **Blocking:** Treat the permeabilized cardiomyocytes with blocking solution containing 0.01% BSA in PBS \\(w/v) for 30 mins at room temperature. \u25b2CRITICAL STEP This step helps to prevent non-specific binding of the fluorophores and is important while using primary and secondary antibodies. \r\n\n\n**11\u2502** **Immunostaining of cardiomyocytes:** Label the fixed cells with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin for staining F-actin \\(1:40, A-12380, Molecular Probes), and SYTO 11 Green-Fluorescent Nucleic Acid stain for staining the nucleus \\(1: 500, S-7573, Molecular Probes) for 30 mins at room temperature in dark \u25b2CRITICAL STEP The concentration and timing for staining should be standardized by the end-user. If the cells are stained with a primary antibody, then the user has to incubate a secondary antibody after washing the cells with PBS \\(2 x 2 mins). The timing and concentration of the primary and secondary antibodies should be standardized by the end user.\r\n\n\n**12\u2502** After incubation with the fluorescent stains, wash the cells with PBS \\(3 x 3 mins) and maintain in PBS with antibiotics added to it. \u25a0 PAUSE POINT The chambers containing the cells can be maintained in dark at 4 \u00baC until imaged to avoid photo bleaching of the fluorophores. It is highly recommended to image the immunostained cells as soon as possible.\r\n\n\n**13\u2502** **Confocal imaging:** \r\n\n\nImages were obtained and processed using FV300 confocal IX81 microscope \\(Olympus Microsystems) and Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope with an oil immersion objective of 60x \\(NA 1.45) at the University of Utah School of Medicine, Cell Imaging Facility, Salt Lake City, UT, USA. The excitation lasers used were Argon 488 to image nucleus stained with Syto 11, HeNe laser 543 and 633 to image F-actin stained with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin and mitochondria stained with MitoTracker Deep Red 633 respectively. Three dimensional z-projection views were obtained by deconvolution and volume rendering of the z-stacks using Olympus FluoView software and Leica Confocal Software \\(Leica Microsystems, Version 2.5, LCS Lite, Mannheim, Germany). Volume visualization of the stacks and 3D movies were generated using Voxx \\(http://www.nephrology.iupui.edu/imaging/voxx/).\n11"

This method is highly reproducible and retains the morphology of the cardiomyocytes. This method will be useful to study morphological changes in the cytoskeletal protein architecture, organellar and protein distribution within the cell without any distortion of intracellular organization. This protocol can be completed in less than 2 days.",
