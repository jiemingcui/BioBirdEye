            "content": "<p>DNA damage, in its many forms,&nbsp;&nbsp;is known to regularly affect cells (1). The toolkit employed by cells to overcome the damage and restore DNA integrity is made of a large collection of sensors and effector molecules and is broadly known as the DNA damage response (DDR, 1). Different types of DNA damage can occur, creating single or double-strand breaks in the DNA molecule (SSB and DSB, respectively). The comet assay has been established long ago for the determination of DNA strand breaks, both SSB and DSB, with the possibility of quantification of the extent of the damage using appropriate sofware packages (reviewed in 2).</p><p>Innate immunity is the first line of defense in cells against invading microorganisms and innate responsive cells such as monocytes and the differentiated effector cells, macrophages, are capable of orchestrating responses to fight pathogens (3). Innate imune responses closely associate with DNA damage, both leading to inflammation, but also to beneficial disease tolerance pathways (reviewed in 4).</p><p>Here we introduce the alkaline comet assay in the human monocytic cell line THP-1. This type of assay is suitable for the quantification of SSBs and DSBs in a manner that is reproducible, accurate and that can be achieved without the need for complicated equipement and in a time frame that extends for no longer than one week.</p>"
