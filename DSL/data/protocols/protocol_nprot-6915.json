            "content": "Nucleic acids are the basis of the biology of every organism. Numerous methodologies have been developed to extract, study and analyse DNA, as it contains information providing insights into the lifestyles and intrinsic characteristics of any organism. In the field of microbiology, DNA has been used for decades as material for studying microorganisms at the highest level of genetic resolution, i.e., at the nucleotide level. For instance, genomic DNA-DNA similarity continues to be a genotypic \u201cgold standard\u201d methodology for confirming whether two bacterial strains belong to the same species. Additionally, the development of next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled the rapid and cost-effective determinations of entire genome sequences of microorganisms, revolutionizing microbiological research. However, the sequencing technologies require that the DNA is extracted in a form that meets particular quantity and quality requirements.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn this protocol, we present a modified version of the Marmur procedure \\(Marmur, 1961), a robust and straightforward method for successful extraction, isolation and purification of total DNA from most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The protocol provides large amounts of high-quality DNA, sufficient and suitable for most downstream applications, including DNA-DNA hybridization, DNA fragment profiling, as well as for the most widely-used next-generation sequencing technologies, i.e., Illumina \\(Illumina, Inc.), Ion Torrent \\(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), PacBio \\(Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.) and MinION \\(Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Bacterial DNA, using this extraction protocol, has been offered as a service at the Culture Collection University of Gothenburg \\(CCUG) during the last 10 years."

Add 10 \u00b5l of lysozyme.\r\n  3. If Gram-positive bacteria, add 10 \u00b5l of mutanolysin.\r\n  4. Mix by vortexing for a few seconds to suspend the biomass.\r\n  5. Add 7 \u00b5l of RNase A.\r\n  6. Incubate at 37\u00b0C for at least 15 \u2013 45 min; vortex every 15 min.\r\n  7. Add 80 \u00b5l of SDS.\r\n  8. Vortex at maximum speed for a few seconds; the viscosity is increased.\r\n  9. Incubate at 65\u00b0C for 10 min; vortex once during this time.\r\n  10. Spin down briefly and add 250 \u00b5l of sodium chloride 5 M.\r\n  11. Vortex at maximum speed for a few seconds and spin down briefly.\r\n  12. Add 400 \u00b5l of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol.\r\n  13. Vortex at maximum speed for a few seconds; shake for 15 min at 1,400 rpm on an orbital shaker.\r\n  14. Centrifuge at > 13,000 x g for 15 min.\r\n  15. Transfer the top-layer to a new tube \\(2 ml); avoid the protein layer.\r\n  16. Add 400 \u00b5l of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol again; shake vigorously by hand and centrifuge again. \r\n  17. Repeat step 16 until there is no protein layer.\r\n  18. To 1 ml of solution, add 90 \u00b5l of sodium acetate 3 M.\r\n  19. To 1 ml of solution, add 600 \u00b5l of cold isopropanol \\(4\u00b0C).\r\n  20. Precipitate the DNA by inverting the tube several times by hand, when threads of DNA are seen, shake the tube harder to clump the DNA threads.\r\n  21. Spool the DNA using a glass rod and leave it to dry completely, for at least 5 min at room temperature.\r\n  22. Alternatively, for steps 20 \u2013 21, if there is no formation of threads, spin down at > 13,000 x g for 10 min, carefully discard the supernatant and let the DNA pellet dry completely at room temperature.\r\n  23. Suspend the spooled or pelleted DNA in 100 \u00b5l of \u2018low\u2019-TE. \r\n  24. Incubate the resuspended DNA over-night at 4\u00baC for complete resuspension."

In most cases, when eluted in 100 \u00b5l of \u2018low\u2019-TE, concentrations \\(Qubit BR measurement) of several hundreds of nanograms per microliter \\(i.e., tens of micrograms in total) and absorbance ratios of 1.8 \u2013 2.0 \\(260/280 nm) and 2.0 \u2013 2.2 \\(260/230 nm) can be expected to be recovered. DNA fragments larger than 60 kb can also be expected for most bacteria.\r\n\n\nOnce dissolved in \u2018low\u2019-TE, the DNA is ready to be used for most downstream applications \\(e.g., Oxford Nanopore sequencing). However, further purification protocols may be applied in cases where downstream applications are very sensitive to contaminants and impurities \\(e.g., PacBio sequencing). But, this modified protocol provides a standard, relatively simple protocol for obtaining the DNA for most cases of whole-genome sequence determinations."
