            "content": "With the increasing burden of infectious diseases, it has become important to develop a rapid ELISA that could facilitate early diagnosis. Earlier, we have demonstrated that the solid phase prepared on a photoactivated polystyrene microtiter plate \\(1) gave around 1.5\u20132 fold higher readings than the untreated  surface when the assay was carried out at 37 degree celsius in around 8 h  \\(2). Further we have reduced the ELISA timing to less than 3 h by doing it at elevated temperature \\(Heat- mediated ELISA or HELISA) onto the  photoactivated plate \\(3). We have also shown that pressure incubation \\(pressure-mediated ELISA or PELISA) can further reduce ELISA timming to 1 h \\(4).\r\n\n\nHerein, we report  the use of ultrasound waves, an alternate source of energy, in reducing ELISA timing for antibody detection. The procedure has dramatically reduced the total time required for ELISA to 40 min with the retention of sensitivity and specificity \\(5)."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "This protocol describes a novel ultrasound-mediated ELISA procedure that can dramatically reduce the ELISA timing to 40 minutes without losing its specificity or sensitivity. Ultrasound-mediated ELISA was best achieved on an activated microtiter plate which was able to covalently bind antigen or antibody. Binding occured  in 10 min when subjected to ultrasound waves in a sonicator bath, operating at an output power of 120 W. Blocking, antibody binding and secondary antibody\u2013enzyme conjugate binding were also accomplished in 10 min each in the sonicator bath under similar conditions. Total IgE detection by 40 min-SELISA method gives similar absorbance value to that obtained by 20 h- conventional procedure. In fact any type of  ELISA can be carried out by SELISA technique. SELISA method is sensitive  and can detect lower concentration of analyte that  could be significantly useful to confirm false negative cases. In short, SELISA procedure is rapid, sensitive, specific and reproducible; hence better option than conventional ELISA procedure.",
