Further study and characterization of exRNAs and their carriers could lead to identification of new biomarkers and have potential for development of novel therapeutics."

Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes while mixing \\(gently flicking tube).\r\n  4. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. There should be a visible fibrin pellet at the bottom of the tube.\r\n  5. Transfer supernatant to new microfuge tube.\r\n  6. Add 125 \u00b5L of ExoQuick Exosome Precipitation Solution to the plasma and incubate for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  7. Centrifuge ExoQuick/plasma mixture at 1,500 \u00d7 g for 30 minutes at room temperature. \r\n  8. Aspirate supernatant. \r\n  9. Spin down residual ExoQuick solution by centrifugation at 1,500 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes at room temperature. \r\n  10. Remove all traces of fluid by aspiration, taking great care not to disturb the pellet.\r\n  11. Resuspend the pellet in 50 \u00b5L sterile PBS and proceed with RNA isolation using SeraMir Exosome RNA Purification Column Kit."

It supercedes an earlier protocol \\(http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/protex.2015.108). The new protocol is based on our experience vetting the original protocol in multiple labs. The major change is an increase in input volume of biofluid from 200 \u00b5L to 500 \u00b5L. We found that the larger input volume led to more reproducible amounts of RNA isolation across multiple experiments. We have also included footnotes to explain changes we made to manufacturers' protocols, and observations that were made while carrying out the protocols.",
