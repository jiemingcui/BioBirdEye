Hence, it is a great challenge to selectively cleave a particular C\u2013H bond in the presence of multiple ones. One of most widely used approach to this problem is the use of \uf073-chelating directing groups<sup>1</sup>. However, the insertion of the transition metal is strictly restricted to the ortho-C\u2013H bond through a six- or seven-membered cyclic pre-transition state \\(TS). Although many strategies have been developed to selectively functionalize meta- and para-C\u2013H bonds<sup>2\u20134</sup>, this newly developed template approach overcomes the intrinsic steric and electronic bias of the substrates, and allows for the activation of remote C\u2013H bonds."
