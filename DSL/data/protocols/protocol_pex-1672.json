The same growth medium must be used in both the apical and basolateral compartments during TEER measurement to avoid creating an ion gradient across the epithelial cell barrier.\n\n \n\n2.   Tissue culture incubator should have CO2 levels checked and recalibrated (if necessary) at least once per week. Incubators should also have external temperature monitoring probes.\n\n \n\n3.   Ensure the care of the EndOhm electrode and the calibration of the voltohmeter (below).\n\n\n\n"
