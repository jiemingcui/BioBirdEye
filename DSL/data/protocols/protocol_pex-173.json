            "content": "<p>Self-renewing and multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are one of the most heavily studied-adult stem cell populations (1,2). HSCs are also used clinically in a form the bone marrow transplantation, a curative therapy for a range of blood diseases from immunodeficiencies to leukemias (3). However, despite the intense biological and clinical interest in HSC biology, most studies are still undertaken in vivo because to date, no stable ex vivo HSC culture conditions have been developed (4).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By taking a reductionist optimization approach, we have developed a simple culture platform that supports functional mouse HSCs ex vivo over 1-2 months (see Associated Publication for details). Limiting dilution transplantation analysis of day-28 HSC cultures estimated a ~900-fold expansion of functional HSCs. HSCs could also be expanded clonally using this system, demonstrating bone fide ex vivo HSC self-renewal. The large numbers of functional HSCs generated by this long-term ex vivo expansion system even enabled HSC transplantation in nonconditioned immunocompetent recipients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Besides optimizing cytokine concentrations, media changes, and plate-coatings, an important step in optimizing these HSC cultures was the identification of the synthetic polymer polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a superior, inexpensive, and chemically-defined alternative to serum albumin supplements. Serum albumin media supplements in the form of fetal bovine serum (FBS), bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA-FV), or recombinant serum albumin, have long represented a major source of biological contaminants and batch-to-batch variability in HSC cultures (5). Although there are still a number of other variables to consider in HSC cultures (e.g. functional heterogeneity of the starting HSC population), we believe removal of serum albumin from HSC cultures is an important step towards improving the stability and reproducibility of HSC cultures.</p>"

Stock at 4\u00b0C.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissolve SCF and TPO cytokines at 1:1000 stocks in F12 media (10 ug/ml for SCF; 100 ug/ml for TPO). Aliquot and stock at -20\u00b0C or -80\u00b0C.\nMake the HSC media:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Media should be prepared fresh for every use and media should be pre-warmed to 37\u00b0C before use.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mix media reagents to make F12 media supplemented with 10mM HEPES, 1X P/S/G, 1X ITSX, 1 mg/ml PVA, 100 ng/ml TPO, and 10 ng/ml SCF. Prepare enough for 200 ul per well. Note that PVA solution is viscous and will need to be pipetted slowly. Mix media well by inversion before use.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer 200 ul media into desired 96-well plate wells (or 1 ml media for 24-well plate wells). Fill remaining plate wells with PBS.\nInitiate the HSC culture:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directly sort HSCs by FACS into 96 well plate wells. For bulk HSC cultures, we recommend starting with at least 50 cells/well, although 1-500 cells can be sorted into a 96-well plate. Please see other published protocols for HSC sorting (6,7,8).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although cultures can be initiated from mouse cKit\n+\nSca1\n+\nLineage\n-\nor CD34\n-/lo\ncKit\n+\nSca1\n+\nLineage\n-\nbone marrow cells, we recommend using CD150\n+\nCD34\n-/lo\ncKit\n+\nSca1\n+\nLineage\n-\n.\nMaintain the HSC culture:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following sorting, HSCs should be immediately transferred to a tissue culture incubator set to 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nand 20% O\n2\n.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Avoid disturbing the cultures where possible, although cells can be visually evaluated by light microscopy.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the first 5-6 days of culture, media changes should be made every 2-3 days. It is important to perform complete media changes on the cultures to avoid the buildup of differentiation-inducing cytokines.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before initiating media changes, prepare fresh HSC media as above. Use a pipette to gently remove all media from the well. Remove media from the wall of the well and the media\u2019s surface to avoid disturbing the cells, which are only gently attached to the well bottom. Remove all media until the meniscus reaches the plate bottom.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gently add 200 ul of fresh and pre-warmed media down the well of the well. To avoid cells drying out, we do not recommend removing media from too many wells at one time.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After media changes, transfer back to the tissue culture incubator. Repeat media changes every 2-3 days throughout the culture.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cultures initiated from 50 cells can be maintained in the same 96-well plate well for 28-days. Alternatively, once cells reach ~90% confluency, cells can be expanded. Typically, 1x 96-well plate well can be passaged into 3x 96-well plate wells (each containing 200 ul media) or 1 x 24-well plate well (containing 1 ml media). Cultures initiated from 50 cells typically reach ~90% confluency after 21 days of culture. Dissociated attached cells by gently pipetting the media over the plate bottom.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At any time during culture, cells can be used for\nin vitro\nanalysis (e.g. cell counting, flow cytometric analysis, or other) or\nin vivo\ntransplantation (see other published protocols on the HSC transplantation assay (6,7,8).\nCell counting analysis of the HSC culture:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cell cultures can be counted at any point, although it is not recommended to repeatedly mix the HSC cultures.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissociate attached cells by gently pipetting the media over the plate bottom and then transfer 10 ul of the culture to a tube. Mix 1:1 with Trypan Blue and count using a hemocytometer.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively use an automated cell counter, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After 1-week, 50 HSCs should generate approximately 1.5x10\n4\ncells in one 96-well plate well. After 28-days, 50 HSCs should generate approximately 4x10\n5\ncells in one 96-well plate well.\nFlow cytometric analysis of the HSC culture:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cell cultures can be assessed by flow cytometry by staining cells with Sca1, cKit, and Lineage antibodies. The concentration of each antibody should be individually titrated before use. Necessary antibody concentration will change between batches and vendors.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissociate attached cells by gently pipetting the media over the plate bottom (avoid generating bubbles). Transfer to a tube and spin down at 1500 rpm (440\ng\n) for 5 minutes.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend cells in PBS containing a lineage antibody cocktail (containing Biotin-CD4, Biotin-CD8, Biotin-CD45RA/B220, Biotin-Ter119, Biotin-Ly6G/Ly6C, Biotin-CD127, Biotin-FceR1). Stain cells at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes, wash with at least 10 volumes of PBS and spin down.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend cells in PBS containing PE-Sca1, APC-cKit, Streptavidin-APC/eFluor780 antibodies.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>The self-renewal of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is key for life-long maintenance of hematopoiesis and the curative capacity of clinical bone marrow transplantation.&nbsp;However, while in vivo HSC self-renewal has been well-described, existing culture conditions poorly support ex vivo HSC self-renewal and afford a very limited window to study or modify HSCs in-a-dish. Here, we describe a simple culture platform that supports functional mouse HSCs ex vivo for 1-2 months. Rather than containing serum albumin, the media uses the synthetic polymer polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). PVA represents an inexpensive and chemically-defined alternative to serum albumin supplements, which have long represented a major source of biological contaminants and batch-to-batch variability in HSC cultures. This novel culture system therefore provides a useful platform to expand and interrogate mouse HSCs.</p>",
