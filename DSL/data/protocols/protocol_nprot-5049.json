            "content": "Individual cells within the same population may differ markedly.  Several new approaches to single cell analysis have been developed in recent years to investigate significance of cell heterogeneity. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing \\(RNA-Seq) and single cell methylation assays explore cell-to-cell genomic and epigenetic variations<sup>1-6</sup>. Variations among cells may help answer questions posed in aging, development, carcinogenesis and other health conditions. Telomeres are located at the ends of chromosomes, and play important roles in maintaining genomic stability<sup>7</sup>. Telomere shortening triggers cell senescence, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. The only absolute measure of telomere length is the Telomere Restriction Fragments assay \\(TRF) based on Southern blot hybridization<sup>8, 9</sup>. The appearance of long smears on the TRF membranes represents heterogeneity in telomere length from thousands of cells, which can be confirmed at the single cell level by Quantification of Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization \\(Q-FISH)<sup>10, 11</sup>.  We established a novel method to measure relative telomere length in single cells by PCR technology<sup>12</sup>. By using this approach, not only can we measure telomere lengths in individual cells from any cell type, but also we can compare telomere heterogeneity within individual cells from different populations.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Comparison with other methods**\r\n\n\n_Existing methods to measure telomere length at single cell resolution are Q-FISH and Flow-FISH._ Q-FISH requires the cell to be arrested in metaphase, so it cannot be used in non-dividing cells, such as post-mitotic or senescent cells. Flow-FISH requires populations of cells rather than one cell. Whole-genome amplification \\(WGA)<sup>13</sup> can be used to provide sufficient DNA to use established PCR methods to measure telomeres. However, random priming variably amplifies target genes<sup>14</sup>.  Amplification of telomeric DNA \\(TTAGGG)n  is especially variable. Our approach offers the same high efficiency for both telomere and Alu amplification by specific target primers. We therefore avoid recovery bias of different targets and obtain precise measurement of relative telomere length in individual cells.  In contrast to other methods our technique can be performed in many different cell types, including cultured and in vivo cells. This new method also allows for high throughput processing of samples \\(more than 100 cells) using the 384-well qPCR thermal cycler because of simple workflow \\(Fig.1), lower cost and accuracy.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Limitations**\r\n\n\nA diploid human cell contains approximately 7pg genomic DNA<sup>15</sup>, which is below the level of detection by traditional real-time PCR. Our strategy utilizes pre-PCR of the target sequences \\(telomere and Alu) in genomic DNA, so any genomic contamination occurring before the amplification can be problematic. Also, this method amplifies two specific targets and no further measurements can be performed to characterize the same sample, such as SNP, DNA sequencing and methylation assay.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Experimental design**\r\n\n\n_Considerations for sample preparation_.   Our technique amplifies telomere and reference gene simultaneously in order to calibrate relative telomere length by comparison to the reference gene. We can assay one or more cells in a single tube. We designed the following detailed procedure \\(see steps 1-6) to obtain a single cell as often as possible without contamination. We use a commercial micro-pipette and tips for ease of use and greater control for isolation of single cells with precise volume. Hand-pulled pipettes give only approximate volume, which may influence the lysis efficiency and amplification reaction.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Selection of reference gene \\(Alu) as an internal control._ Theoretically, we can directly compare the amplification plots of each sample\u2019s telomere target to demonstrate relative telomere length between samples because each reaction starts with a single cell\u2019s genome. Intervening steps and use of multiple plates introduce additional sources of error, so it is necessary to have an internal control for calibration. We chose the most abundant repetitive DNA sequence, Alu, as a reference<sup>16</sup>, instead of a single copy gene, to minimize the effect of allele drop-out. Even so some variation in Alu copy number may exist among cells,<sup>17, 18</sup> so caution must be taking when comparing results of the assay among different cell types.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Cycle numbers for pre-amplification._ Robust and faithful pre-PCR from a single cell is critical for our assay. To keep the native ratio of telomere and Alu sequences in pre-PCR, cycle number must be optimal. Excessive amplification will distort the ratio and inadequate ratio will provide insufficient material for subsequent steps. In our previous work<sup>12</sup> we demonstrated that the Ct value \\(also named Cq in Bio-Rad software) increases proportionally with decreasing pre-PCR cycle numbers from 18 to 14 in single human fibroblasts. The cycle number can be varied for different samples and cycling conditions, but should be the same for all the samples to be compared. In the current protocol, 17 cycles of pre-PCR proved optimal for the human cells used. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Considerations of pre-PCR efficiency._ Many factors influence the efficiency of pre-PCR, including contents of the lysis buffer and type of DNA polymerase used. Here, the lysis buffer contains EDTA and Nonidet P-40 to gently release the DNA without interfering with the subsequent pre-PCR. Compared to alkaline lysis or enzymatic digestion of DNA, this lysis buffer is easy to make, store and use. Figure 2 shows that our system possesses high pre-PCR efficiency.  We compare the relationship between Ct value to doubled cell numbers which have been treated by 1 \u00b5l of 2 X lysis buffer. In general, the hot start Taq DNA polymerase is better than regular Taq DNA polymerase when performing pre-PCR.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Primer dimers._ Despite the fact that telomere primers were designed to avoid formation of primer dimers, we observe persistent signal in the negative control, but only at cycle 31 during the real-time PCR step. We assume the repetitive telomere primers hybridize with one another. Primer dimer analysis \\(Thermo Scientific Multiple Primer Analyzer online) of the multiplexed four primers \\(Telomere and Alu, forward and reverse each) in the pre-PCR reveals the 17 primer dimers combinations \\(Fig.3a). The longest possible dimers \\(100 ~ 500 bp) can be formed by overlapping between two telomere primers \\(Fig.3b). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Controls in SCATR-PCR**\r\n\n\nNo-template control \\(NTC) in PCR is essential to discriminate between contamination and primer dimers from sample PCR products. SCATR-PCR requires two NTC setups, one for pre-PCR and another for real-time PCR- during the pre-PCR step, 1 \u00b5l of PBS without any cell or DNA for the first no-template control \\(1stNTC). A second control reaction \\(2ndNTC) with water at the real-time PCR step monitors for the presence of contaminating amplicons. It is crucial to run the 1stNTC from the very beginning of the protocol.  These NTCs must be run on every plate. The most common source of contamination comes from water and air.  Reagents used in the assay, e.g. DNA polymerase, primers and SYBR green also can become contaminated. Use of filtered and pre-sterilized, DNase, RNase-free, disposable tips and disposable aliquots of reagents made in sterile conditions minimize reagent contamination.\r\n\n\nWe recommend two positive template controls \\(PTC). Single cells exhibit significant heterogeneity and are inadequate to serve as consistent positive controls. Genomic DNA, diluted to the single cell genome equivalent, approximately 7pg, serves as the 1stPTC to assess the efficiency of pre-PCR.  We run the 2ndPTC at the real-time PCR step using genomic DNA \\(25 ng) to monitor assay variation over the time and normalize all samples within each plate/run of the assay. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Standard curve**\r\n\n\nOptimal real-time PCR assay is essential for accurate and reproducible quantification.  It is crucial to determine whether the assay has high amplification efficiency, as revealed by a consistent standard curve. Efficiency close to 100 % is the indicator of a robust and reproducible real-time PCR assay, but amplification efficiency of 90-105 % is acceptable in practice. The telomere and Alu primers have high amplification efficiency<sup>12</sup> \\(R2 > 0.99), but each run of the reaction may exhibit minor variations in amplification efficiency over time and with different operators. Potential sources of variation include pipetting technique, different DNA templates, suboptimal reaction conditions and nonspecific product formation. In theory, any dilution series will produce amplification curves with similar efficiency, but for a 2-fold dilution with 5 points, potential artifact is higher than for a 10-fold dilution with 5 points<sup>19</sup>. To accurately determine the efficiency of a real-time PCR assay, 5-fold dilution series rather than 2-fold dilution series is used to generate the standard curve. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Data analysis**\r\n\n\nRelative quantification using 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method<sup>20, 21</sup> is the most common calculation in real-time PCR for data analysis. This method assumes 100 % amplification efficiencies for both target and reference genes. In practice, similar amplification efficiencies between target and reference genes usually are presented in real-time PCR for the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method. If the amplification efficiencies of target and reference gene are different, the Pfaffl Method<sup>22</sup>, a variation of the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method can be used to determine the relative quantification. The first paper for measurement of telomere length used the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method, and its high amplification efficiencies of target and reference genes were confirmed by running standard curves<sup>23</sup>. In our experience with SCATR-PCR, the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method can be used so long as a standard curve is run on every plate to monitor amplification efficiency."

Place all PCR tubes into the thermo cycler and run the same program as step25.\r\n  37. Purify the pre-PCR product by following Box1.\r\n  38. Prepare 5 series of standard DNA by 5-fold dilution with water in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes as shown below. Mix well and let stand on ice.

Mix well by vortex and spin shortly.\r\n  **SEE TABLE 10**\r\n\n\n**\u0394CRITICAL** Make sufficient master mixes by adding at least 10 extra reactions to calculate for total 96 reactions. \r\n\n\n40. Setup 96-well PCR plate with 15 \u00b5l of master mix plus 5 \u00b5l of DNA sample \\(purified pre-PCR product) by the below described.\r\n  **SEE TABLE 11**\r\n\n\n**\u0394CRITICAL** Each plate has to be set up with at least three controls including 1stNTC, 2ndNTC and 2ndPTC. Since pre-PCR has demonstrated to have high efficiency by using 1stPTC at the above steps, it is not required that 1stPTC be run during the qPCR in order to save wells for samples.\r\n\n\n41. Spin for 5 min at 3000 rpm and run the same program as step 29.\r\n  42. Repeat steps 39-41 for Alu primers.\r\n  \r\n\n\n_Data analysis \u00a9TIMING 2-3 h_\r\n\n\n43. Examine whether there is abnormal amplification plots or not. Normal amplification plot shows a linear baseline region and a log phase of amplification followed by a plateau \\(Figure 5). The red lines in Figure 5a represent a common abnormal amplification plot as a result evaporation from poorly sealed PCR plate wells. \r\n  44. Check the Ct value of 2ndNTC. For telomere primers, the Ct values are usually great than 30 and for Alu primers, greater than 35 \\(Figure 5b and 5c). If the Ct value of 2ndNTC is less than 25, the data is unreliable likely due to some contaminations in real-time PCR. \r\n  45. Check the real-time PCR efficiency of the standard curves. In practice 90-110 % of efficiency is acceptable. For our data, the standard curves of telomere and Alu are around 100 % for each run \\(Figure 5b and 5c). \r\n  46. Export the data to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. \r\n  47. Copy the Cq, Cq Mean and Cq Std. Dev. of all wells for Tel and Alu to the blank sheet in a new Excel file. Calculate the Coefficient of Variation \\(CV) for each triplicate by the below formulation: CV = Cq Std. Dev / Cq Mean x 100 % \\(see Supplementary file).\r\n  48. Check the reproducibility of triplicates by observing the CV. Normally triplicate of each sample should show the CV is below 3 %. If the CV is higher than 3 %, triplicate\u2019s Ct value should be checked. If one of triplicate is far away from others, then perform the rest of the analyses using the 2 most similar replicates. If a triplicate is far away from each other, cut off this sample. For example, the single cell F8 \\(Supplementary file) shows the CV is 18.54 %, and then data analysis was done by using duplicate Ct values \\(18.15 and 17.89). Same deal with the single cells U2, U6, F15 and R15 \\(see the yellow highlight in Supplementary file). \r\n  49. Check the Ct value of 1stNTC. Generally our data showed it is around 21-24 and much greater than those of 2ndPTC and samples for both of Tel and Alu \\(Figure 5b, c). If it is similar to that of 2ndPTC or samples \\(Figure 4b), the result is false due to potential contamination.\r\n  50. Check the Ct of Alu. Usually the Ct of Alu is different in different cell lines because of variation of Alu copy numbers in different cell lines. But the Ct of Alu should be similar for the same cell line. Supplementary file shows the three cell lines \\(U2OS, hESC and fibroblast) have different Ct value of Alu. If the Ct value of Alu is far away from others, for an example, the Ct of Alu in sample F3 is around 16 and far away from others \\(around 13) \\(Supplementary file with blue highlight), it might mean an inefficient pre-PCR or wrong template such as dead cell/cell fragment. Delete those samples that the Ct value of Alu is close to 1stNTC because it means no template inside.\r\n  51. Calculate the relative T/R ratio by 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method if the standard curves of telomere and Alu show similar high amplification efficiency. The same 2ndPTC in each plate is used to normalize all the data over time. The whole calculations for our two independent experiments in supplementary file are obtained by using three steps below:\r\n  \\(Step 1) \u0394Ct =Ct \\(Tel) \u2013 Ct \\(Alu)\r\n\n\n\\(Step 2) \u0394\u0394Ct = \u0394Ct\\(sample) \u2013 \u0394Ct \\(2nd PSC)\r\n\n\n\\(Step 3) Relative T/R ratio of each sample= 2-\u0394\u0394Ct\r\n\n\n52. Statistical analyses are completed by using software GraphPad Prism 6. Unpaired T-test compares relative telomere length and F-test compares the variations. Significant difference is defined by P < 0.05."

By running different no-template controls \\(Fig. 4), it can be evaluated whether the conditions are optimal or not prior to SCATR-PCR assay at large scale. Once the workflow of SCATR-PCR has been validated with controls and samples of known telomere length, the large scale single cell samples can be evaluated within days under the same reaction conditions. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe compared relative telomere length in individual cells from three different human cell lines here by the SCATR-PCR assay, which are representative of the wide range of natural human telomere lengths. The relative telomere length of individual U2OS cells is longer and more heterogeneous than those of individual F171 and RuES2 cells \\(Fig. 6). Although some of individual F171 cells show relatively longer telomeres than do some of individual RuES2 cells, average telomere length of RuES2 is longer than that of F171, P = 0.018 \\(One way ANOVA) \\(Fig. 6d). Compared to RuES2 and F171, the variation of relative telomere length in individual U2OS cells is greater by F-test \\(P< 0.05). But the variation did not differ in a statistically significant manner between RuES2 and F171 \\(F-test). The average telomere length in these three cell lines by SCATR-PCR assay is consistent with TRF and QFISH in our previous studies<sup>12</sup>."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Currently several assays are utilized to assess average telomere length of bulk cells that do not account for the heterogeneity of telomere length among individual cells. We have developed a simple and robust method of Single Cell Amplification of Telomere Repeats by PCR \\(SCATR-PCR) that can compare relative telomere length in individual cells based on a real-time PCR technique. Briefly we release single cell DNA with a specialized lysis buffer, and then employ a multiplex pre-amplification \\(pre-PCR) step that simultaneously amplifies both telomere repeats \\(T) and Alu as a reference gene \\(R) with a fixed ratio between targets. After purification of pre-PCR product, SYBR Green-based real-time PCR is performed with the same primer sets. For the data analysis, we employ relative quantification \\(2-\u0394\u0394Ct) to compare telomere length of single cell by T/R ratio in different samples. The whole process can be completed in 2 days.",
