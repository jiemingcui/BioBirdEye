This original system combines magnetic nanoparticles and viral vectors that will be retained after injection at the magnetically targeted site. In this way, targeted delivery minimizes systemic distribution, decreases gene vectors inactivation and reduces toxicity. Furthermore, the magnetic forces enhance the uptake of magnetic nanoparticles by the target tissue, and thus improve the efficiency of transduction. This allows decreasing the required process time of delivery to few minutes which is crucial for improvement of in vivo nucleic acid delivery \\(principally in stringent conditions, refer to results for more information). All In vivo Magnetofection\u2122 reagents have been especially designed by our R&D team to meet in vivo grade quality \\(reagents performed under high manufacturing and quality standards and tested by strict quality controls)."

The In vivo ViroMag and saline solutions should be at room temperature. You may use 10 to 20 \u00b5L of In vivo ViroMag per 1x106 infectious viral particles. Do not exceed recommended volumes for injection.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Reagents preparation. Immediately before use, vortex In vivo ViroMag vial. Add suitable amount of In vivo ViroMag to a sterile microtube\r\n  Note: If required In vivo ViroMag can be diluted with deionized water only. Discard the diluted In vivo ViroMag after use.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Complexes formation. Add your virus preparation to the tube containing the In vivo ViroMag reagent and mix immediately by pipetting up & down. Incubate 15-30 min at room temperature.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Injection.\r\n  a. Place the magnet on your targeted tissue\r\n\n\nb. Slowly inject the complexes \r\n\n\nc. Let the magnet stand from 5 min to 1 h \r\n\n\nNotes for intracerebroventricular or intratumoral injections: Place the magnet few seconds after complexes injection. Dye e.g. Fast Green FCF can be added to the complexes solution for a better monitoring of the injection.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. Monitor gene expression at the appropriate time point.\r\n  \r\n\n\nImportant notes: \r\n\n\n\u2022 Do not inject more than 1 mL of In vivo ViroMag per animal.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Do not inject complexes if precipitate has formed"

In order to improve your transduction, prefer a route of injection close to your target tissue; e.g. inject your vector intra-arterially into the tissue supplying artery \\(use the same quantity as intravenous administration, be careful, intra-arterial manipulations enhance the risk of thrombosis) or directly into the tissue of interest together with magnet application. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4- Medium used for preparing transduction complexes. Favour saline buffer \\(HBS, PBS, normal saline, Ringer\u2019s solution) or 5% glucose during the preparation of the complexes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5- Injection volume. Optimize the volume of injection to your application.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6- Speed of injection. DNA expression could be dependent on the injection speed, adapt your speed of injection to your target tissue.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7- Transduction reagent temperature. Reagents must be at room temperature and be vortexed prior to use.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n8- Old transduction reagent / DNA complexes. The transduction reagent / viral particles complexes must be freshly prepared every time. Complexes prepared and stored for longer than 2 hours can be aggregated.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n9- Incubation time. Optimal time range between transduction and assay varies with tissue, promoter, expression product, etc. Transduction efficiency can be monitored after 4 \u2013 48h by analyzing the gene product.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPrecipitate formation \r\n\n\n- Injection solution.
