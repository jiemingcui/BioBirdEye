            "content": "<p>In this protocol, we introduce an engineered viral protease, Lb<sup>pro</sup>* from foot-and-mouth-disease virus, as a novel tool to study the complexity of ubiquitin modifications. Unlike canonical deubiquitinases which hydrolyze the isopeptide bond following the C-terminal GlyGly motif, Lb<sup>pro</sup>* specifically cleaves the peptide bond preceding the GlyGly motif. Consequently, this\u00ad\u00ad motif remains attached to the modification site. In our recent paper we show this unique proteolytic activity can be used to dissect the architecture of ubiquitin signals on substrates (i.e. ubiquitinated proteins or polyubiquitin chains) including: 1) <em>in vitro</em> assembly reactions, 2) total cell lysates, 3) polyubiquitin chains enriched from cells, and 4) isolated damaged mitochondria. The starting point for this protocol is the expression and purification of Lb<sup>pro</sup>*, which routinely yields large quantities of highly pure and active enzyme. After purification, ubiquitinated substrates are digested with Lb<sup>pro</sup>*. This results in the collapse of polyubiquitin chains to mono-ubiquitin species. These mono-ubiquitin species consist of ubiquitin moieties with a \u2018clipped\u2019 C-terminus (-114 Da) and ubiquitin molecules with one or more GlyGly-modifications (+114 Da). These mass differences, plus any additional chemical modifications (e.g. phosphorylation or acetylation) are easily distinguishable by mass and can be quantified using standard intact mass spectrometry methods and software. In the last sections of this protocol, we describe procedures for the preparation of ubiquitin samples for Ub-clipping and then discuss the analysis of these samples by mass spectrometry.&nbsp;</p>"

Plate the cells onto a LB plate (supplement LB plate with 100 \u00b5g/ml Ampicillin and 30 \u00b5g/ml Chloramphenicol) and incubate the plate overnight at 37 \u00b0C.\nCritical Step:\nLb\npro\n* expression in\nE. coli\nstrains other than pLysE or pLysS may lead to premature lysis and therefore reduced yields.\n2. Pick a single colony from the LB plate and inoculate 100 mL of LB medium (supplement LB medium with 100 \u00b5g/ml Ampicillin and 30 \u00b5g/ml Chloramphenicol).\n3. Incubate the culture overnight at 37 \u00b0C while shaking at 180 r.p.m.\n4. Use the overnight culture to inoculate 900 mL of 2x YT medium (supplement 2x YT medium with 100 \u00b5g/ml Ampicillin and 30\u00a0\u00b5g/ml Chloramphenicol) in a 2 L flask.\n5. Incubate the culture at 30 \u00b0C while shaking at 150 r.p.m.\n6. Once the culture has reached an OD\n600\nbetween 0.5 and 0.6 immediately cool the culture for 30 min at 18 \u00b0C while shaking at 150 r.p.m.\n7. Induce expression of Lb\npro\n* with 0.4 mM IPTG (final concentration).\n8. Incubate the culture for 16-20 h at 18 \u00b0C while shaking at 110 r.p.m.\n9. Harvest cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n10. Re-suspend cell pellet in 30 mL Buffer A and store at -80 \u00b0C. Alternatively, proceed onto the cell lysis procedure.\n(B) Cell lysis\n1. Add 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1 mg/ml DNAse I to the resuspended cells, mix thoroughly, and incubate the solution on ice for 10 min.\n2. Sonicate the resuspended cells on ice (recommended sonication settings: 10 sec burst, 10 sec off, amplitude 60 W for 3 min).\n3. Clear the cell lysate by centrifugation at 50,000 x g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C.\n4. Remove the supernatant and, together with a magnetic stir bar, place into a 100 mL beaker on ice overtop a stir plate at 4 \u00b0C.\n(C) Purification\nAmmonium sulfate precipitation\n1. With gentle stirring, slowly add the 100% saturated ammonium sulfate solution to the cleared cell lysate to a final concentration of 30% (v/v).\n2. Incubate solution for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C with gentle stirring.\n3. Centrifuge solution at 50,000 x g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n4. Keep the supernatant and discard the pellet.\n5. Further precipitate proteins from the supernatant, including Lb\npro\n*, by adding the 100% saturated ammonium sulfate solution as before to a final concentration of 60%.\n6. Incubate solution for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C with gentle stirring.\n7. Centrifuge solution at 50,000 x g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n8. Discard the supernatant and keep the pellet.\n9. Re-suspend the pellet in Buffer A (8 mL of Buffer A per 1 L of cell culture) on a roller mixer.\n10. Dialyze the resuspended pellet into 1 L of Buffer A at 4 \u00b0C overnight to remove excess ammonium sulfate.\nAnion exchange chromatography\n1. Prior to loading the sample onto the Resource Q anion exchange column, we recommend further diluting the sample 1:10 in Buffer A.\n2. Load the diluted sample onto the Resource Q anion exchange column using either a peristaltic pump, sample pump, or superloop.\n3.

Analyze the ion-exchange run on an SDS-PAGE gel (\nFig. 1b\n).\nNote:\nAt this point in the purification it is expected to have contaminating proteins in the Lb\npro\n*-containing fractions. However, these will be removed in subsequent steps of the purification.\n5. Pool the peak Lb\npro\n*-containing fractions and concentrate to 1.5 mL using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (10K MWCO). Note: Multiple anion exchange runs can be pooled for size exclusion chromatography.\nSize exclusion chromatography\n1. Run the concentrated sample on a size exclusion column (HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 pg) equilibrated in Buffer A (\nFig. 1c\n).\n2. Analyze the size exclusion chromatography run on an SDS-PAGE gel (\nFig. 1d\n).\n3. Pool the peak Lb\npro\n*-containing fractions and concentrate the sample using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (10K MWCO).\nNote:\nLb\npro\n* can be concentrated to 20-30 mg/ml.\n4. Determine the protein concentration, aliquot and flash-freeze the sample in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 \u00b0C.\nNote:\nLb\npro\n* can be stored for several years at -80 \u00b0C, but is unstable at 4 \u00b0C and should never be stored at this temperature. Purification routinely yields 5-10 mg per L and is sufficient to perform all steps of the protocol below multiple times.\nGeneration of substrates for Ub-clipping\nUb-clipping can be performed on any ubiquitinated substrate or sample. Here we describe the preparation and Lb\npro\n* digestion of three different ubiquitin samples. This includes:\nI)\ntotal ubiquitin from whole cell lysate,\nII)\npurified ubiquitin chains from cells, and\nIII)\nisolated mitochondria. Together, these protocols will not only facilitate the analysis of these substrates, but also serve as a reference point for Ub-clipping analysis of other ubiquitinated proteins.\n\ufeff\nI. Ub-clipping on whole cell lysate\n(A) Culturing and harvesting cells\n1. Culture cells in one 15 cm petri dish containing Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and PenStrep (Penicillin and Streptomycin).\n2. Grow cells to 90-95% confluence.\n3. Place petri dish on ice and remove DMEM medium.\n4. Wash cells 2x with 10 mL of ice-cold PBS.\n5. Remove excess PBS.\n6. Add 500 \u00b5L PBS to the petri dish.\n7. Scrape off cells and transfer to a pre-chilled 1.5 mL tube.\n8. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n9. Remove and discard the supernatant.\n10. Flash-freeze the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen or proceed with the protein extraction procedure described below.\n(B) Protein extraction\n1. Resuspend cell pellet in 300 \u00b5L of freshly prepared extraction buffer.\n2. Sonicate the sample using a microtip (recommended sonication settings: 10 sec burst, 10 sec off, amplitude 5-10 W for 1 min).\nNote\n: cells can also be lysed by passing the sample through a 26.5 Gauge needle.\n3. Incubate sample on ice for 1 min.\n4. Repeat sonication step.\n5. Centrifuge cell lysate at 21,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n6. Remove the supernatant and add fresh DTT to a final concentration of 10 mM.\n7. Determine the protein concentration with a Bradford assay.\n8. Dilute the protein extract 1:4 (vol:vol) with Lb\npro\n* digestion buffer.\nNote:\nThis will reduce the final concentration of urea to 1 M, a concentration in which Lb\npro\n*\nis active.\n9. Proceed with Lb\npro\n* digestion and purification of total ubiquitin.\n(C) Lb\npro\n* digestion and purification of ubiquitin\n1. Add Lb\npro\n*\nto the diluted cell lysate and incubate for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C.\nNote:\nOvernight digestion with 10 \u03bcM Lb\npro\n* is sufficient to collapse the ubiquitin smear (\nFig. 2\n). For WT Lb\npro\n, we recommend using a concentration higher than 10 \u03bcM during digestion.\n2. Add Lb\npro\n-treated sample to a pre-soaked dialysis tubing or cassette (3.5K MWCO).\n3. Dialyze sample in cold Milli-Q water overnight at 4 \u00b0C with gentle stirring.\n4. Remove sample from dialysis and place into a 1.5 mL tube.\n5. Centrifuge sample at 21,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n6. Remove the supernatant and discard the pellet.\n7. Run the supernatant on a Superdex 75 Increase 3.2/300 gel filtration column using an \u00c4KTA Micro system.\nNote:\nWe recommend connecting a filter immediately before the column. This will help minimize unwanted damage to the column.\n8. Identify ubiquitin-containing fractions with anti-ubiquitin Western blots.\n9. Pool the ubiquitin-containing fractions and concentrate using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (3.5K MWCO).\nNote:\nMinimize contamination of unwanted proteins from the early fractions containing the void elution, as these proteins will interfere with downstream mass spectrometry analysis.\n10. Flash-freeze protein in liquid nitrogen or aliquot and lyophilize. Store sample at -80 \u00b0C.\nII. Purification of ubiquitin chains and digestion with Lb\npro\n*\n(A) TUBE pull-down and digestion\nNote:\nThe TUBE pull-down procedure is a modified protocol from Hjerpe et al., 2009\n4\n.\n1. Culture and harvest one 10 cm petri dish of cells as described above.\n2. Resuspend the cell pellets in 300 \u00b5L TUBE lysis buffer.\n3. Supplement the lysis buffer with 100 \u00b5g of GST 4x ubiquilin 1 TUBE\n4\n.\n4. Incubate on ice for 20 min.\n5. Clear lysate by centrifugation at 21,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n6. Incubate sample with 25 \u00b5L pre-washed Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin\non a rotating wheel for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C.\n7. Centrifuge sample at 300 x g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C and discard supernatant.\n8. Wash beads with 500 \u00b5L ice-cold PBS + 0.1% Tween20 (v/v).\n9. Repeat steps 7-8 two more times.\n10. Wash beads with 500 \u00b5L PBS.\n11. Centrifuge sample at 300 x g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C and discard supernatant.\n12. Incubate TUBE-bound ubiquitin chains with 100 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5M Lb\npro\n* in TUBE digestion buffer for 16 h at 37\u00b0C.\nNote:\nThis is an on-bead cleavage assay, where Lb\npro\n* clips and releases ubiquitin into supernatant.\n13. Centrifuge sample at 300 x g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n14. Transfer supernatant to a fresh tube and perform perchloric acid extraction.\n(B) Perchloric acid extraction of ubiquitin\n1. Slowly add perchloric acid to the ubiquitin sample to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v), mix thoroughly.\n2. Incubate sample for 10 min on ice.\n3. Centrifuge sample at 21,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nNote:\nThis step retains the ubiquitin species in the supernatant. Discard the pelleted protein precipitate.\n4. Place the ubiquitin-containing supernatant in a pre-soaked Slide-A-Lyzer MINI 3.5 K (MWCO).\n5. Dialyze sample in cold 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C with gentle stirring.\n6. Dialyze sample in cold Milli-Q water overnight at 4 \u00b0C with gentle stirring.\n7. Lyophilize sample and store at -80 \u00b0C.\nIII. Isolation of damaged mitochondria and digestion with Lb\npro\n*\n(A) Mitochondrial damage\ufeff\n1. Culture cells in two 15 cm petri dishes containing Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and PenStrep (Penicillin and Streptomycin).\n2. Grow cells to 80% confluence.\n3. Treat cells with DMEM medium containing OA (10 \u03bcM oligomycin and 4 \u03bcM Antimycin A) and incubate for 2 h back in the 37 \u00b0C incubator.\n4. Place petri dish on ice and remove DMEM medium.\n5. Wash cells 2x with 10 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nNote:\nPBS can be supplemented with 200 mM chloroacetamide to further inhibit deubiquitinase activity.\n6. Scrape off cells and transfer to a pre-chilled 1.5 mL tube.\n7. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n8. Remove and discard the supernatant.\n9. Wash the cells with PBS and centrifuge again.\n10. Remove and discard the supernatant.\n11. Store at -80 \u00b0C or proceed to the purification of mitochondria.\nB) Purification of mitochondria\nNote\n: This protocol was adapted from Lazarou et al., 2007\n6\n. All steps should be performed on ice or at 4 \u00b0C.\n\ufeff\n1. Resuspend cell pellets in 2.5-5 mL of mitochondrial isolation buffer containing 1x cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and 1x PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail.\n2. Incubate on ice for 30 min.\n3. Transfer resuspended cells to a 5 mL dounce homogeniser and homogenise with 25-30 strokes with a drill-fitted pestle.\nNote:\nTo ensure the cells are properly disrupted without damage to mitochondria, the number of strokes may be varied depending on the torque of the drill.\n4. Transfer the sample to a 50 mL tube.\n5. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g\nfor 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n6. Carefully split the supernatant across several 1.5 mL tubes.\n7. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n8. Remove the supernatant.\nNote:\nSteps 1-3 can be repeated with the 1,000 x g\npellet to liberate more mitochondria from unbroken cells.\n9. Thoroughly resuspend and pool the 10,000 x g\npellets in 1 mL of mitochondrial isolation buffer.\n10. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nNote:\nThis spin will remove any contaminating nuclei.\nCritical Step\n: Failure to thoroughly resuspend the mitochondria will cause them to be lost at this step.\n11. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\n12. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n13. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL mitochondrial isolation buffer excluding the inhibitors.\n14. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n15. Remove supernatant.\n16. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of sucrose storage buffer.\n17. Determine the protein concentration using a BCA assay.\nNote:\nSamples can be stored at -80 \u00b0C until needed.\n(C) Sodium carbonate extraction and Lb\npro\n* digestion of purified mitochondria\nNote:\nThe sodium carbonate extraction procedure was adapted from Fujiki et al., 1982a & 1982b\n7,8\n1. If frozen, thaw the isolated mitochondria on ice.\n2\ufeff. Aliquot the desired amount of protein in a 1.5 mL tube.\nNote:\nThe amount of mitochondria can range between 0.2-1 mg per sample and will depend on the downstream application as well as density of ubiquitination.\n3. Extract the soluble and peripheral membrane proteins by resuspending the pellet in fresh sodium carbonate solution at a ratio of 1 \u03bcL per \u03bcg mitochondria.\n4. Incubate the sample for 30-45 min on ice with occasional vortexing.\n5. Centrifuge at 21,000 x g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n6. Discard the supernatant and keep the pellet containing integral membrane proteins.\nNote:\nThe degree of extraction depends on the pH of the Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, so this should be measured and kept constant across experiments.\n7. Resuspend the pellet in mitochondria Lb\npro\ndigestion buffer at a ratio of 1 \u03bcL per 10 \u03bcg mitochondria.\n8. Add an equal volume of mitochondria Lb\npro\ndigestion buffer containing 20 \u03bcM Lb\npro\n*.\n9. Incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C.\nCritical Step:\nIn addition to helping reduce the catalytic cysteine of Lb\npro\n*, DTT inhibits a mitochondrial carboxypeptidase that cleaves Arg74 of ubiquitin after Lb\npro\n* cleavage.\n10. Centrifuge sample at 21,000 x g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n11. Remove the supernatant and transfer to a fresh tube.\n12. Protein can be immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or aliquoted and lyophilized. Store sample at -80 \u00b0C.\nMass spectrometry & Ub-clipping analysis\nMass spectrometry analysis will largely depend on the available equipment. As a result, in this section of the protocol we have minimized instrument-specific details and provided general guidelines for analysis and data processing of samples. For specific details on reagents and instrumentation, please see the method section of our paper.\n(A) Mass spectrometry\n1. Resuspend sample in reconstitution buffer.\nNote:\nThe resuspension volume will depend on the sample and sensitivity of the mass spectrometer.\n2. Desalt your sample using C\n4\nreverse phase media before mass spectrometry analysis.\nNote:\nThis can be performed before or during HPLC runs.\n3. Prior to ionization, separate ubiquitin species with an analytical column packed with C\n4\nreverse phase media.\n4. Standard acetonitrile gradients can be used to elute ubiquitin from the analytical column.\n5. We recommend performing mass analysis at the highest mass resolution setting possible.\n(B) Data analysis\n1. The analysis of ubiquitin modifications from mass spectrometry data files can be performed by peak integration or spectra deconvolution.\nNote\n: In many cases both approaches yield comparable results. However, spectra deconvolution is preferred when quantifying both phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites.\n2. For peak integration, quantitation should be performed on the ubiquitin species with the highest intensity (e.g. ubiquitin with a charge state of 12) and the nominal mass. After peak integration, export the area under the curve for each species and quantify their relative abundance.\n3. For spectra deconvolution, all spectra corresponding to ubiquitin should be averaged and deconvoluted. After spectra deconvolution, export the intensities of each ubiquitin species and quantify their relative abundance.\n\ufeff"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>The post-translational modification of proteins with ubiquitin is a dynamic multifaceted process affecting all aspects of eukaryotic cellular biology. The complexity of ubiquitin modifications arises from their ability to form architecturally distinct polyubiquitin chains<sup>1-3</sup>. Despite our understanding of the importance of these signals, we currently lack tools and methods to study them. Here we describe an approach, termed Ub-clipping, which provides unprecedented insight into ubiquitin chain architecture. This protocol is related to our recent Nature paper titled, \u201cInsights into ubiquitin chain architecture using Ub-clipping\u201d. &nbsp;This technology takes advantage of an engineered viral protease, Lb<sup>pro</sup>*, which \u2018clips\u2019 ubiquitin such that the information on the site of modification is retained and the remaining ubiquitin and substrate polypeptides are kept intact. The goal of this protocol is to allow researchers to efficiently adapt our new technology to their proteomic workflows. We anticipate this method will continue to shed light on the architecture of ubiquitin signals, and therefore further our understanding of the ubiquitin code across a broad spectrum of biological systems.&nbsp;</p>",
