            "content": "<p>Supercoiled (form I), nicked circular (form II), and linear (form III) DNAs derived from the same plasmid DNA can be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis<sup>1</sup>. In the case of nicked circular DNAs, agarose gel electrophoresis alone cannot distinguish between plasmids that contain one or more ligatable nicks, which require both 5\u2019-phosphate and 3\u2019-hydroxyl groups<sup>2</sup>, from those containing non-ligatable nicks or non-ligatable single-stranded DNA gaps. In addition, depending on the electrophoresis conditions, nicked circular DNA and relaxed covalently closed circular DNA that is not supercoiled are not always well-separated from each other.</p><p><br></p><p>During the maturation of DNA replication and DNA repair intermediates, the generation of products containing ligatable nicks that are then sealed by DNA ligase is essential, as the replication of DNA templates with single strand interruptions generates double-stranded DNA breaks and result in cell cycle arrest and/or genome instability. To avoid this, cells encode many activities preventing the accumulation of these sorts of non-ligatable lesions. For example, in every round of mammalian cell division 50 million Okazaki fragments must be processed to generate a continuous strand<sup>3</sup>. During Okazaki fragment maturation, Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1, called Rad27 in&nbsp;<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>) cleaves 5\u2019 flaps generated by the extension of Okazaki fragment maturation by DNA polymerase delta. FEN1 binds branched DNA substrates so that a bound one-base 3\u2019 flap registers the FEN1 active site for precise cleavage<sup>4</sup>. Other non-ligatable discontinuities are generated during base-excision repair in which the non-conventional 5\u2019-deoxyribose phosphate moiety is generated from apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and must be removed<sup>5</sup>. Similarly, many forms of DNA damage, particularly those involving environmental agents, generate \u201cdirty\u201d ends that are further processed by a variety of activities to generate substrates that can be processed by DNA polymerases and DNA ligases<sup>6</sup>.</p><p><br></p><p>Since evaluation of the ligatability of nicked circular DNAs can provide mechanistic insights into the nature of the products of DNA repair reactions reconstituted&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>, we have developed a method to readily identify plasmid products that can be ligated. To improve the separation of products that can and cannot be ligated, we have taken advantage of the fact that only covalently closed DNAs can be supercoiled by the action of DNA gyrase<sup>7</sup>. We have applied this method to the analysis of the products of a Rad27-dependent DNA mismatch repair reaction reconstituted with&nbsp;<em>S. cerevisiae</em>&nbsp;proteins. In these reactions, the DNA mismatch repair machinery directs a mispair-promoted reaction in which extension of a pre-existing 5' nick by DNA polymerase delta in combination with Rad27 in a reaction that is regulated by the Msh2-Msh6 mispair recognition protein generates a product in which 5\u2019 flap generated by strand displacement synthesis is cleaved to generate a ligatable nick through the action of Rad27.</p>"
