            "content": "Microtubules \\(MTs) are composed of 13 protofilaments that interact laterally to form a hollow tube. These protofilaments are themselves the result of the longitudinal interaction between tubulin dimers<sup>1</sup>. MTs can self-assemble from free tubulin in solution in presence of GTP, this process is reversed by hydrolysis of the GTP into GDP which trigger MT disassembly<sup>2</sup>. In vitro, MT nucleation is temperature-dependent \\(polymerize at 37\u00b0C and depolymerize at 4\u00b0C) and is limited by the critical concentration for tubulin self-assembly, which is usually around 10 \u03bcM for purified brain tubulin.  \r\n\n\nInterestingly, MTs are anisotropic material with longitudinal interaction between tubulin dimers that are much stronger than lateral ones<sup>3</sup>. Thus, the current model of in vitro MT nucleation is that tubulin dimers interact first longitudinally to form protofilaments and then laterally to form a tubulin sheet that will close into a tube1.  _In vitro_, the initial formation of tubulin sheets is a limiting step in MT nucleation and the oligomers population \\(protofilaments and sheets) is small and dynamic<sup>1,4</sup>, it is therefore difficult to study and quantify pre-nucleation intermediates. \r\n\n\nThe slowly hydrolysable GTP analog GMPCPP and small molecules such as taxol can stabilize tubulin oligomerization and enhance MT nucleation and are often used to study tubulin self-assembly<sup>5,6</sup>.\r\n\n\nAnother major problem in the field is that it is very difficult to study separately longitudinal and lateral interactions between tubulin dimers, due to the tubulin self-assembly properties. Although tubulin-tubulin interactions are crucial for MT nucleation, they also regulate other MT properties such as dynamicity and mechanics<sup>7</sup>. It is thus crucial to develop assays that can investigate potential modifications of these interactions due to tubulin post-translational modifications or mutations<sup>8</sup>. Some methods have been already developed to study longitudinal interactions between tubulin dimers using EM microscopy or AFM by measuring and characterizing the length and curvatures of protofilaments<sup>9,10</sup>. Indentation of the MT lattice can be achieve by AFM and give valuable information on longitudinal and lateral interaction between tubulin dimers<sup>11</sup>. These techniques, although very precise, are either technically challenging or demand time-consuming analysis. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHere we describe a detailed protocol for a method to monitor tubulin oligomerization at a step before MT nucleation occurs, using a FRET-based assay. We took advantage of the tubulin critical concentration for self-assembly to work at a concentration at which no MT nucleates, but at which tubulin oligomerization still occurs. The principle of the technique is to measure over time the fluorescence emitted by a FRET pair of fluorophores when tubulin dimers interact with each other \\(here we chose to label one population of tubulin with DyLight 650 fluorophore and another population of tubulin with rhodamine fluorophore). This technique can also be used to monitor more specifically lateral interactions between protofilaments labelled with either DyLight 650 or rhodamine fluorophores. To conduct the protofilament association assay, we first assembled taxol-stabilized protofilaments at low tubulin concentration \\(0.5 to 5 \u03bcM) and at 4\u00b0C to limit sheet formation and avoid MT nucleation. We stop the protofilaments elongation by the exchange of GTP for GDP by dialysis \\(always in presence of taxol to keep the protofilaments stabilized). Then we measure the FRET emitted fluorescence from the lateral interaction between the protofilaments at 32\u00b0C. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Advantages of the technique:** \r\n\n\n- Dynamically monitors tubulin oligomerization before MT nucleation.\r\n\n\n- Requires only small amount of tubulin protein.\r\n\n\n- Allows a quantification of tubulin oligomers formation under different conditions \\(for examples: compare different nucleotides, drugs, effect of tubulin post-translationnal modifications, tubulin mutations).\r\n\n\n**Disadvantages of the technique:**\r\n\n\n- Need imaging techniques such as EM to verify actual tubulin longitudinal or lateral interactions.\r\n\n\n- Is not an absolute quantitation of the tubulin oligomerization."

Before initiating experiments, tubulin purity needs to be assessed by SDS-page and Coomassie staining. If contaminants are present, tubulin needs to be further purified through a cycle of polymerization/depolymerization in PIPES high molarity buffer as described in Castoldi et al., 2003\n12\n.\r\n  3. Tubulin concentration and labelling stoichiometry need be precisely measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer.\r\n  4. The critical concentration for self-assembly needs to be measured for the specific tubulin preparation using a microtubule nucleation assay\n14\n.\r\n  5. Before conducting the FRET assay, unlabeled and labelled tubulin need to be centrifuged for 5 min at 227,000 x g \\(TLA100, Beckman) to remove aggregates. The cleared tubulin must be kept on ice at all time and not kept more than a few hours before starting the experiments.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**A) Preparing the free tubulin mix for the FRET self-assembly assay**\r\n\n\n6.

The Micro-cell and Hamilton syringe should be kept at 4\u00b0C \\(or on ice) to avoid warning up the tubulin mix before measurement is initiated. The fluorimeter should be turn on at least 30 min before use and the temperature controller set at 32\u00b0C. The Micro-cell adapter should be set up on the fluorimeter and pre-equilibrated at 32\u00b0C to allow the reaction mix to reach temperature rapidly.\r\n\n\n7.

In contrast, in the presence of GTP, tubulin oligomerizes at 5 \u03bcM in the absence of stabilizing agents \\(such as taxol) and an increase in the emitted fluorescence intensity is detected over the course of the experiment. In the presence of taxol or GMPCPP, microtubules will nucleate at 5 \u03bcM tubulin concentration, thus the tubulin concentration needs to be set at 0.5 \u03bcM to avoid microtubule nucleation. Although this technique is quantitative and allow to compare result between two conditions \\(two isotypes of tubulin, post-translational modification or tubulin mutations), it is desirable to use complementary analysis in particular negative staining electron microscopy to obtain visual confirmation of protofilaments and sheet formation.\r\n\n\nFRET between fluorophores on neighboring tubulin dimers can in theory result from either longitudinal or lateral interactions. However, it has been proposed that protofilaments formation might reach an equilibrium within less than 5 min<sup>10</sup>. Since emitter fluorescence steadily increases over the first 15 min in the presence of GTP, it is conceivable that longitudinal interactions are established before fluorescence measurement is initiated and that the assay monitors mostly lateral interactions."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Microtubules nucleation, dynamic instability and mechanical properties are regulated by tubulin-tubulin longitudinal and lateral interactions. It is thus crucial to develop assays that can investigate potential modifications of these interactions due to tubulin post-translational modifications or mutations. Here we describe a detailed protocol for a method to monitor tubulin oligomerization at a step before MT nucleation occurs, using a FRET-based assay. Briefly, the principle of the technique is to measure over time the fluorescence emitted by a FRET pair of fluorophores when tubulin dimers interact with each other below the critical concentration for microtubules self-assembly. This technique can also be used to monitor more specifically lateral interactions between protofilaments each labelled with one FRET pair of fluorophores. The experiment can be completed within 2-3 hours.",
