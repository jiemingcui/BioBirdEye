            "content": "<p>Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technologies are leading to a more complete understanding of heterogeneity in cell types and states. However, standard scRNA-Seq methods capture a mixture of&nbsp;newly-transcribed&nbsp;(\u201cnew\u201d) and pre-existing (\u201cold\u201d) RNAs without being able to temporally resolve RNA dynamics. To overcome this challenge, we developed scNT-seq, a high-throughput and UMI-based scRNA-Seq method that&nbsp;jointly profiles both new and old transcriptomes from the same cell. In scNT-Seq, integration of metabolic RNA labeling, droplet microfluidics, and chemically induced recoding of 4sU to cytosine analog permits highly scalable and time-resolved single-cell analysis of cellular RNA dynamics (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). We demonstrate that the method is easy to set up and substantially improves the time and cost. We show scNT-Seq enables temporally resolved analysis of gene regulatory networks and RNA trajectories in different cell cultures, including K562 cells, mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and primary mouse cortical neurons (Qiu et al, 2019).</p>"

            "content": "Metabolic labeling\n1. Culture K562 cells at 37\u00b0C to approximately 50% confluence in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S\u00a0(e.g., 5 mL of 5x10\n5\ncells/mL in 6 well tissue culture plates).\n2. Make 1 M 4-thiouridine (4sU) stock by dissolving the powder in DMSO. For metabolic RNA labeling, the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with non-toxic concentrations of 4sU (e.g. 200 \u03bcM for mESCs).\nNote:\nThe 4sU stock is stable for a few months at -20\u00b0C, and protect the 4sU stock solution from light.If the labeling time is longer than 4 hours, regular exchange of fresh 4sU-containing media (i.e. every three hours) can enhance 4sU incorporation (Herzog et al. 2017).\n3.\u00a0Remove media at the time-points of interest, prepare cell suspension or cryo-preserve (methanol fixation and rehydration) cells as described below.\n4. Methanol-fixation (Optional):\nNote:\nMethanol-fixation and rehydration were adapted from Alles\u00a0et al (2017).\na. Fixation the cells (0.5~1.5 million in 200\u00a0\u03bcL\u00a0DPBS) by adding 800\u00a0\u03bcL\u00a0methanol\u00a0drop-wise\u00a0(with P1000 pipette), while gently stirring the cell suspension with the tip. [final concentration of methanol is 80%]\nb. Gently invert the tubes ~5 times to mix, then put the tubes on ice for >30 min.\nc. Store at -80\u00b0C\u00a0for up to one month.\nDroplet microfluidics\n5. Rehydration\u00a0(Optional):\na. Spin down the cells at 800x g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C.\nb. Remove the methanol-PBS solution without disturbing the pellet.\nc. Resuspend the cells with 1 ml of DPBS-0.01% BSA (with 0.5% RNase-inhibitor).\nd. Count the cells with Countess II.\ne. Dilute the cells with either DPBS-0.01% BSA or SSC cocktail to 100 cells/\u03bcL.\n6. Proceed to standard Drop-Seq protocol to capture new and old RNAs on barcoded beads (Macosko et al, 2015).\nChemical conversion of 4sU in mRNAs captured on barcoded beads\n7. After droplet breakage, the barcoded beads are treated with TimeLapse-Seq chemistry (Schofield\u00a0et al, 2018) to convert 4sU to cytidine-analog on new RNAs.\na. Briefly, 50,000-100,000 beads were washed once with 450 \u03bcL washing buffer (1 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2)).\nb. The beads were resuspended with a mixture of TFEA (600 mM), EDTA (1 mM) and sodium acetate (pH 5.2, 100 mM) in water.\nc. A solution of 192 mM NaIO\n4\nwas then added (final concentration: 10 mM) and incubated at 45\u00b0C for 1 hour with rotation.\nd. The beads were washed once with 1 mL TE, then incubated in 0.5 mL 1 X Reducing Buffer (10 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min with rotation, , followed by washing once with 0.3 mL 2X RT-buffer.\nscNT-Seq library preparation and sequencing\n8. Reverse transcription and downstream library preparation steps were performed as previously described in Drop-Seq (Macosko et al, 2015).\n9. After determine the optimal number of PCR cycles with an aliquot of 6,000 beads, we prepared PCR reactions with rest of barcoded beads collected for each scNT-Seq run, adding 6,000 beads per PCR tube, and ran the TSO-PCR program to enrich the cDNA. We then tagmented cDNA using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina), starting with 550-1,000 pg of cDNA pooled from all PCR reactions for a given run. Following cDNA tagmentation, we further amplified the library with 12 enrichment cycles using the Illumina Nextera XT i7 primers along with the P5-TSO hybrid primer (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACGCCTGTCCGCGGA AGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT*A*C).\n10. After quality control analysis using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent), libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument using the 75-cycle High Output v2 or v2.5 Kit (Illumina). We loaded the library at 2.0 pM and added Custom Read1 Primer (GCCTGTCCGCGGAAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC) at 0.3 \u03bcM to position 7 of the reagent cartridge. Paired-end sequencing was performed on Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer as described previously (Hu et al 2017). The sequencing configuration was 20 bp (Read1), 8 bp (Index1), and 60 bp (Read2)."

The concentration and size distribution of final library is quite similar to standard Drop-seq library (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). QC of sequencing data: After integration of reads from all cells, you should observe much higher T-to-C mutation than other types of mutation (e.g., 1%-5% after 4 hours labeling).

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing offers snapshots of whole transcriptomes but obscures the temporal dynamics of RNA biogenesis and decay. Here we present single-cell metabolically labeled new RNA tagging sequencing (scNT-Seq), a method for massively parallel analysis of newly-transcribed and pre-existing RNAs from the same cell. This droplet microfluidics-based method enables high-throughput chemical conversion on barcoded beads, efficiently marking newly-transcribed RNAs with T-to-C substitutions.&nbsp;The steps of the protocol are (1) metabolically labeling of cells with 4sU, (2) co-encapsulating individual cell with a barcoded oligo-dT primer coated bead in a nanoliter-scale droplet, (3) performing&nbsp;one-pot&nbsp;4sU chemical conversion on pooled barcoded beads, and (4) reverse transcription, cDNA amplification, tagmentation, indexing PCR, and sequencing. scNT-Seq provides a broadly applicable strategy to investigate dynamic biological systems at single-cell resolution.</p>",
