            "content": "Singlet oxygen \\(1O<sub>2</sub>) is a high energy appearance of oxygen exists in the singlet state with a total quantum spin of zero<sup>1</sup>. In 1931, it was predicted as meta-stable intermediate state in dye-sensitized photo-oxygenations<sup>2</sup>. However, in 1964, it was fully established that 1O<sub>2</sub> was same whether generated in sensitized photo-oxygenations<sup>3</sup>, through radio frequency<sup>4</sup> or chemical reactions \\(e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NaOCl)<sup>5</sup>. It forms a crucial part in almost every field of science including biological \\(food oxidation, cell signalling, oxidative stress)<sup>6-8</sup>, medical \\(photodynamic therapy for microbes, malaria or cancer) <sup>9-11</sup>, environmental \\(as an air pollutant  due to ozone decomposition)<sup>12</sup>, chemical \\(chemical production of 1O<sub>2</sub> and reactions involving 1O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>13</sup> and physical \\(the best part to explain the properties of 1O<sub>2</sub>, especially its reactivity and stability in various solvents and how it influences numerous aspects like light-related properties with the help of quantum theory)<sup>14</sup> sciences \\(Figure 1 & Figure 2).\r\n\n\nIn this protocol, we are reporting a simple high throughput procedure for singlet oxygen quenching which can be easily determined spectrophotometrically in a 96 well plate format at 440 nm. This protocol is an improved and customized version wherein the system used to generate singlet oxygen can be done chemically \\(equimolar H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NaOCl) or biologically \\(photosensitizer and light/UV source) with RNO \\(p-nitroso dimethylaniline), a strong yellow color dye and imidazole or its derivatives \\(L-Histidine)<sup>15</sup>. The bleaching is a consequence of 1O<sub>2</sub> capture by the imidazole ring which results in the formation of a trans-annular peroxide intermediate complex<sup>16</sup>. In the absence of RNO, 1O<sub>2</sub> decomposes or rearranges into the final oxygenation product, therefore, the imidazole system along with RNO can be used as a sensitive and selective test for the presence of 1O<sub>2</sub> in aqueous solutions \\(Figure 3). Singlet oxygen can also partially bleach RNO even in the absence of imidazole derivatives. In such a case, the bleaching of RNO is strongly increased by the presence of imidazole molecules with a characteristic dependence on their concentration. The separation of the product of RNO bleaching by thin layer chromatography also serves as an additional proof of the presence of 1O<sub>2</sub> in the system. The imidazole with RNO technique has been applied to a number of sensitizing and non-sensitizing dyes<sup>15-20</sup>. Various other methods have also been reported \\(Table 1)<sup>19-45</sup> but they all require highly specialized instruments, costly fluorescent/luminescent probes, and/or highly dangerous radioactive probes still being more sensitive and efficient. If the sample size is huge and has to be assessed on a large scale, our method is more useful, easy, simple, accurate and cost-effective."

We prepare 1M stock solution from which we add 20\u00b5l for 200\u00b5l reaction mixture.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSample Preparation\r\n\n\nPositive control \\(Rose Bengal) and negative control \\(DABCO) is prepared in deionized water likewise other samples either a crude extract from plant, cell, tissue, pure samples can be prepared in their respective solvent i.e. DMSO, ethanol or water. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMethodology\r\n\n\n1. Mark 96 well plate in such a way that one row in triplicate is used for L-histidine followed by another row in triplicate without L-histidine. Rows with L-Histidine contain 25\u00b5l L-histidine solution while rows without L-histidine contains same amount of buffer.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Add the test sample/standard in triplicate in both marked row of 96-well plate and keep control wells without any sample or standard.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. For a standard sample, we used 100\u00b5M, 50\u00b5M, 25\u00b5M concentrations in triplicate in both L-histidine and without L-histidine rows.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. For control wells \\(without any sample) we have added 106.5\u00b5l of 25mM sodium phosphate buffer for 200\u00b5l reaction mixture.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Add 20\u00b5l RNO in each well and keep the plate in a dark place. \r\n  \r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: wrap the RNO tube with aluminum foil because it is light sensitive.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6. Then, add 20\u00b5l of 100mM H\n2\nO\n2\nin each well followed by immediate addition of 28.5\u00b5l of 100mM NaOCl.\r\n  \r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: Add NaOCl immediately after H2O2 \\(there should be no time gap) otherwise RNO dye will be bleached as it is sensitive to hypochlorous acid and this may give false positive results.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7. Cover the 96-well plate with lid and wrap with aluminum foil then incubate the plate in the dark for 10 min at room temperature.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. Finally, take the absorbance or kinetic reading \\(for 10 min) at 440nm in a microplate reader. Kinetic reading taken for 10 min with 5 sec orbital shaking, medium and read at 30-sec interval.\r\n  \r\n\n\n9. The graph is drawn with respect to control. Bleaching of RNO decreases the intensity of yellow color with decrease in optical density which indicates that singlet oxygen has not been quenched by the sample otherwise if there is no bleaching, it means that singlet oxygen has been quenched by the sample.\r\n  Percentage of singlet oxygen inhibition by sample is calculated by\r\n\n\n                              = \\(control O.D-sample O.D) X100\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n10.

We have chosen different concentrations of buffer, RNO, L-Histidine and equimolar solution of NaOCl/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in order to find the appropriate combination of concentrations which can give least absorbance value \\(Table 3; Figure 4-5). In short, if this system is working properly then more absorbance means more quenching of singlet oxygen. In Figure 4, spectra of various molarities of RNO and buffer were taken and \u03bb max was observed. By this experiment, we have established that \u03bb max for 100, 50, 25\u00b5m of RNO was 440nm; while at other concentration it was found to be at 350nm. We have chosen 100\u00b5m RNO concentration for our further experiments as it shows maximum absorbance while there was no significant changes obtain at different molarities of buffer. We also wish to judge the best concentration of L-Histidine and NaOCl/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which can be used for the assay procedure. We have taken five different concentrations of L-Histidine and three different concentrations of NaOCl/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and tried all possible permutation and/or combinations as reflected in Figure 5. It was observed that a combination of 12.5mM of L-Histidine and 100mM of NaOCl/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gives a minimum optical density \\(absorbance), hence it was used for further experimentation. \r\n\n\nThe equimolar concentration of NaOCl/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generates singlet oxygen which is captured by L-Histidine forming trans-annular complex with RNO resulting in the bleaching of RNO as a consequence a decrease in the optical density \\(absorbance) was observed. The experiment was also performed at different pH in order to get the optimum pH and the least optical density \\(absorbance). At pH 7 which also represent the physiological pH \\(Figure 6) significant and required values were revealed. Spectral analysis was also performed with standard antioxidant in a range of 340-600nm and it was observed that 440nm was the best wavelength for all the studied antioxidant compounds \\(Figure 7).  Time-dependent experiments revealed \\(Figure 8) that initial change occurs within 2 min after the reaction starts and saturation occurs after 10 min which is the endpoint."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "An easy spectrophotometric method for evaluating quenchers of singlet oxygen is described which can be used for high throughput assessment of large number of samples in a 96-well plate format. Singlet oxygen is a higher energy state molecular oxygen species produced in various intracellular reactions, extracellular reactions by the aid of photo sensitizer, light source and/or by chemical means. In this protocol, we have developed a simple and accurate procedure for generating singlet oxygen with no side reactions at physiological pH. The second aspect of this assay is detection by p-nitroso dimethylaniline \\(RNO), which is an already established suitable trap with imidazole and/or its derivatives for singlet oxygen. We have synchronized the assay system by performing various combinations of reagent used and also by plotting their spectra, pH and time-dependence curve monitored spectrophotometrically at 440nm\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\n\nCOMMENTS\r\n\n\nProtocol edited 29/07/2016\r\n\n\n- Ashleigh Carver, Editorial Assistant, Nature Protocols",
