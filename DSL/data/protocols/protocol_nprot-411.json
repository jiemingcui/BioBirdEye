            "content": "The protocol describes quantitative analysis of males&#x2019; phonotaxis induced by female calls. This protocol is used to demonstrate that the ultrasonic concave-eared torrent frogs _Odorrana tormota_ inhabiting noise habitats, as a model of acoustic communicating animals, show hyperacute phonotaxis to the female&#x2019;s courtship calls <sup>1</sup>. The acoustic recording and playback systems used have several advantages over the more widely used call or song detection methods: 1) the systems allow continuously recording diverse types of calling with a sampling rate \\(96-480 kHz); 2) calls can be simultaneously analyzed and displayed using SELENA software; 3) recorded calls can be easily saved into electronic data files and chosen as stimuli, and 4) the stimuli are varied according to experimental need and stably presented through the playback device for auditory electrophysiological or ethological study. The method for quantitative analysis of phonotaxis includes that 1) the scaled traces of acoustic evoked phonotactic paths are based on the videotaped record of the experiment; 2) five parameters are measured: latency and pattern of antiphonal response, distance of a hop, azimuthal angle and index of straightness<sup>2</sup> relative to the broadcasting loudspeaker based on unambiguous phonotactic behaviors, and 3) all data are statistically tested."

Basic characteristics of calls produced by females of the frog O. tormota, which are distinct from males&#x2019; calls in the fundamental frequency, multiple harmonic components, frequency-modulation patterns, and call duration, etc. \r\n\n\n2. The latency of antiphonal vocalizations and call patterns produced by receptive males under the stimulation of female calls, each call pattern likely representing different ethological implications during courtship.\r\n  3. The azimuthal angles and index of straightness. If attracted males show greater hop distances, smaller azimuthal angles relative to the loudspeaker, and the index of the path straightness close to one, it indicates that these animals exhibit hyperacute phonotaxis toward the female&#x2019;s courtship calls. \r\n  Afterwards, it may infer that the concave-eared torrent frogs Odorrana tormota have evolved the ability of high frequency call production and hearing, which should be the adaptation to intense low-frequency background noise."
