            "content": "Non-invasive endocrinology - Non-invasive endocrine monitoring through the analysis of urine and/or faecal samples provides invaluable information on the functioning of reproductive and stress endocrine systems in amphibians \\(Narayan 2013). In the past, hormone monitoring relied on blood sampling after physical restraint or anesthesia that can be impractical and stressful \\(Whitten, Brockman & Stavisky 1998). The stress generated by the restraining procedures, besides compromising animal health, would also render multiple and consecutive collection unfeasible, although it would certainly increase the hormone parameters to be measured by the action of augmented stress hormones over the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal \\(HPG) axis with a consequent effect on sex steroids and gonadotropins \\(Pukazhenthi & Wildt 2004). \r\n\n\nThe evaluation of steroid metabolite content in amphibian urine represents a snapshot of hormone activity and permits the long term study of reproductive patterns in individuals, populations or species, all without perturbing the animal \\(Narayan et al. 2010a; Narayan, Cockrem & Hero 2013b; Narayan & Hero 2013). Non-invasive endocrine monitoring techniques have been the only feasible way to get serial physiological data on free-living individuals \\(Narayan et al. 2010b). Urine and or faecal samples can be collected from free-ranging animals and contain gonadal and adrenal hormones that parallel profiles of serum hormones \\(Narayan, Cockrem & Hero 2013a). In some cases, excreted hormones can even be superior to blood data because they represent average values pooled over time, rather than a single point in time measure \\(Carey 2005). In other words the resulting hormone profiles are generally less noisy than those observed after analyzing blood because the excretory patterns represent a pool of metabolites since the last excretion rather than reflecting the often hour-to-hour fluctuating dynamism quantified in blood \\(Pukazhenthi & Wildt 2004). Thus minor differences in metabolite levels due to sampling time variation of a few hours and possible capture-handling stress should not turn up in the samples \\(Narayan, Cockrem & Hero 2011; Narayan, Cockrem & Hero 2013a).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHormone metabolism - Metabolism of circulating gonadal and adrenal steroids occurs in the liver and or kidney before excretion into urine or bile. Generally, biologically potent steroids such as Testosterone \\(T), Progesterone \\(P), Oestradiol \\(E2) and Corticosterone \\(CORT) are rendered impotent during metabolism through subtle molecular changes and or thorough conjugation to highly charged, side chain moieties \\(e.g. glucuronide or sulphate molecules) before excretion \\[See \\(Narayan 2013) for detailed review]. Conjugated steroids have increased molecular polarity that improves solubility in the aqueous environments of urine or bile. Whether the steroid hormones are primarily passed into urine or feces is species dependant. \\(Millspaugh & Washburn 2004) discussed the many confounding factors e.g. the length of the time animals are held in captivity, normal seasonal and daily rhythms, body condition, sample storage and treatment techniques, diet of the animal, assay selection, animal status \\(i.e. social status, reproductive ranking), sample age and condition, and sample mass, that inhibit the utility of hormone metabolite analysis. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSteroid measurements - Immunological techniques such as enzyme-immunoassays \\(EIAs) are used today because they are capable of measuring small quantities of hormones. In fact, EIAs are now as sensitive as radioimmunoassay \\(RIA) and so are gaining in popularity \\(Brown, Walker & Steinman 2003). Urinary steroids are almost always excreted as conjugates \\(e.g. oestradiol-sulphate, oestrone-glucoronide). The advent of direct conjugate immunoassay procedures, antibodies raised against specific steroid conjugates simply permit dilution and assaying urine without further processing minimizes sample processing. Urinary steroid measures are typically indexed to creatinine excretion, which is measured using a modified Jaffe reaction \\(Monfort 2003). Urinary measurements have the advantage over faecal methods by providing a reduced lag-time for steroid excretion \\(i.e. relative to blood circulation), simplified processing, and reduced labor and ultimatey lower costs. Once collected, urine can be preserved indefinitely by freezing \\[-20<sup>o</sup>C or -80<sup> o</sup>C] \\(Monfort 2003)."

Appropriate acknowledgement has been given to suppliers of reagents and protocols referred from earlier reviews on other animals. The assays reagents were procured from the Endocrinology Laboratory, University of California, Davis, USA and provided by Dr Coralie Munro. Recent studies on amphibians using these reagents have been described in the recent author\u2019s review paper \\(Narayan 2013).   \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2.1 Reproductive Steroids\r\n\n\nConcentrations of testosterone \\(T) hormone metabolites were determined in frog urine samples using a polyclonal anti-T antiserum \\(R156/7) diluted 1: 25000, horseradish peroxidase \\(HRP) - conjugated T label diluted 1: 40000 and T standards \\(0.78-200pg/well). Concentrations of estrone conjugate \\(EC) metabolites in frog urine samples were determined using a polyclonal anti-EC antiserum \\(R522-2) diluted 1: 45000, HRP-conjugated EC glucuronide label diluted 1: 45000, and EC glucuronide standards \\(0.39-100pg/well). Concentrations of progesterone \\(P) metabolites in frog urine samples were determined using a monoclonal anti-P antiserum \\(CL425) diluted 1:15 000, HRP-conjugated progesterone label diluted 1: 40000, and progesterone standards \\(0.39-100pg/well). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2.2 Corticosterone \r\n\n\nConcentrations of urinary corticosterone were determined using a polyclonal anticorticosterone antiserum \\(CJM06) diluted 1: 45 000, horseradish peroxidase conjugated corticosterone label diluted 1: 120 000 and corticosterone standards \\(1.56\u2013400 pgwell\n\u20131\n). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2.3 General assay design \r\n\n\nThe 96 well Nunc maxi-SorpTM plates were coated with 50 \u00b5L of antibody in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA) coating buffer \\(50 mM bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) and incubated for at least 12 h overnight at 4\n\u25cb\nC. For all assays, standards, internal controls and urine samples were diluted in enzyme immunoassay buffer \\(39 mM NaH\n2\n\\(PO\n4\n) 2H\n2\nO, 61 mM NaHPO\n4\n, 15 mM NaCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0). For all assays, 50 \u00b5L of standards, internal controls and urine samples were added to each well of the coated Nunc Maxi-Sorp\nTM\nplates according to the assay plate map \\(Fig. 1). About 50 \u00b5L of the corresponding horseradish peroxidase label was then added to each well, and the plates incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were washed and 50 \u00b5L of a substrate solution \\(0.01% tetramethylbenzidine and 0.004% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 M acetate citric acid buffer, pH 6.0) was added to each well. Stopping solution \\(50 \u00b5L of 0.5 mol/L H\n2\nSO\n4\n) was added based on the visual inspection of plates so that the optical density of the zero wells would read between 0.7 and 1 \\(usually after at least 10 min incubation at room temperature). Non-specific binding was accounted for by subtracting blank absorbance from each reading. Standard curves \\(Fig. 2) were generated and a regression line fitted by the method of least squares and used to determine hormone metabolite concentrations in the frog urine samples. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2.4 Creatinine assay \r\n\n\nIn amphibians, urine concentration varies as a function of osmoregulation of water stored in the bladder \\(Duellman & Trueb 1994). Creatinine \\(Cr), a by-product of muscle metabolism, has been shown to be an effective measure of glomerular filtration in frogs \\(Forster 1938). It is excreted at constant rate in individuals with normal kidney function and is therefore a good index of the amount of time over which hormones have been metabolized into the urine regardless of the volume of the sample. Creatinine concentrations in frog urine were determined using the Jaffe method \\(Narayan et al. 2010a). The creatinine results were used to calculate urinary hormone metabolite concentrations in relation to urinary creatinine concentrations. All steroidal concentrations were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error \\(SE) pg/\u00b5g Cr."

This technical paper, I describe step by step methods for the laboratory validation of enzyme-immunoassays \\(EIAs) for the quantification of reproductive hormones \\(testosterone, oestradiol and progesterone) and stress hormone \\(corticosterone) entirely non-invasively in amphibian urine samples. These laboratory validation steps include \\(1) Accuracy/recovery checks, \\(2) Parallelism and \\(3) Quality control. I also present standard assay methods and together these will enable the advancement of non-invasive reproductive and stress endocrinology of amphibians.",
