            "content": "Our fundamental knowledge of DNA structure is based on the Watson-Crick model of DNA double helix, in which two polynucleotide chains running in opposite direction are held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. Guanine can bind specifically only to cytosine \\(G-C) whereas adenine can bind specifically to thymine \\(A-T). These reactions are described as base and the paired bases are said to be \u201ccomplementary\u201d \\(1). Conformational polymorphism of DNA is now extending beyond the Watson-Crick double helix. In 1986, using forced field calculation\r\n\n\nfor a short \u2018A-T\u2019 rich DNA, Pattabiraman proposed the hypothesis that homopolymeric duplex DNA containing d\\(A)6d.\\(T)6 can form a thermodynamically stable parallel right-handed duplex DNA with reverse Watson-Crick base pairing. He also reported that the number and type of hydrogen bonds between A-T base pair are the same as that of antiparallel double helix \\(2). In 1988, the experimental strategies by Ramsing and Jovin confirmed that DNA containing A-T base pairs can exist as a stable parallel-stranded helix. The\r\n\n\n\u201cTm\u201d value of both PS-DNA \\(parallel-stranded DNA) and APS-DNA \\(antiparallel-stranded DNA) showed a classical dependence upon salt concentration. They reported that at any given NaCl concentration, the melting temperature of PS-DNA was 15\u00b0C lower than its\r\n\n\nAPS-DNA counterpart. In 2 mM MgCl2, the melting temperature for PS-DNA and APS-DNA was reported approximately same as those obtained in 0.2\u20130.3 M NaCl, demonstrating pronounced stabilization afforded by divalent cations \\(3). A similar study by Sande et al. on hairpin deoxyoligonucleotides having oligonucleotides\r\n\n\nsequence in parallel polarities \\(PS-hairpin) also confirmed the existence of parallel-stranded conformation. They have shown that parallel-stranded hairpins form stable duplex and get denatured at 10\u00b0C lower than corresponding APS oligomers \\(4). These two experimental studies provided evidence that DNA containing \u201cA-T\u201d base pairs can form both PS-DNA and APS-DNA. In 1992, Tchurikov et al. showed that parallel complementary probes of normal nucleotide consisting of both AT/GC base pairs can be used for molecular hybridization experiments, indicating the stability of G-C containing parallel DNA \\(5). In 1993, Borisova et al. reported that G-C pairs in a 40 base pair parallel duplex DNA \\(consisting of natural\r\n\n\nDNA sequence) are more thermostable than A-T base pairs \\(6). Furthermore, other similar reports have shown that there are no drastic differences in nearest neighbor base pair interactions between\r\n\n\nPS-DNA and APS-DNA having mixed AT/GC composition \\(7). The specificity of the interaction between the strands in parallel DNA has also been studied and it is so high that parallel probe as short as 40 nucleotide length is able to detect a specific band in Southern blot hybridizations on whole genome DNA \\(8). The polymerase chain reaction \\(PCR) developed by Mullis consists of denaturation of double-stranded DNA, primer annealing and extension. The process is repeated multiple times and the template DNA is amplified millions of times without any change in polarity of DNA \\(9). In\r\n\n\n2000, Veitia and Ottolenghi reported that several attempts to amplify L15253 by PCR using different pairs of primers were unsuccessful. They suggested that there are no thermodynamic constraints\r\n\n\nwhich will prevent parallel nucleic acid synthesis, and the deoxynucleotide triphosphates used for a normal antiparallel polymerization reaction can also serve for a parallel reaction, provided that the\r\n\n\npolymerase enzyme is capable in catalyzing the nucleophilic interaction between the 3\u00b4OH and a 5\u00b4PPP from nucleotides arranged in a parallel way with respect to the template DNA \\(10).\r\n\n\nIn this study, we explored whether parallel DNA synthesis is feasible. We proposed the hypothesis that this reaction can be possible if we start a reaction using single stranded DNA as a template. We have shown that the Taq DNA polymerase can even extend the oligonucleotide primer annealed to single stranded DNA in a parallel complementary manner."

Further reactions happened in a conventional way leading to the synthesis of PCR product having polarity opposite to the template used.",
