The World Health Organization recently announced the disease's outbreak.</p><p>The so-called \"Post-COVID Syndrome\" refers to symptoms that persist after treatment and may be related to residual inflammation (seizures), physical injuries, side effects from the hospital or chronic shortness of breath (post-intensive care syndrome), isolation or impact on health conditions&nbsp;already existing.</p><p>The definition of pulmonary rehabilitation, as derived from the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society, is a comprehensive intervention based on comprehensive patient evaluation followed by patient-centered therapies that include, but are not limited to, training, education, and behavioral changes designed to improve respiratory status.</p><p>The goal of rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients is to alleviate dyspnea symptoms, eliminate anxiety, lose weight, reduce disability, maintain function, and improve health. Each patient should have a plan for lung rehabilitation..</p><p>When possible and safe, pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered during dynamic administration of COVID-19, and may include nutrition, ventilation, standing, clearing process, oxygen supplementation, breathing exercises, stretching, and strengthening exercises. Given the possibility of long-term disability, lung rehabilitation following hospitalization is recommended..</p><p>An important part of rehabilitation is restoring &nbsp;strength and independence in exercise training. Cardio breathing exercises are related to making a large, strong, balanced muscle group go to great exercise for a long time.</p><p>The goal of this study is to look into the effect of a 6-week Physical Rehabilitation programme on Post COVID syndrome patients' physical fitness (cardiovascular fitness) and health-related quality of life.</p>"

Patients will be evaluated according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\u00a0Inform consent Patients will be taught to wear comfortable clothes, walking shoes and masks. There is a 2-team supervised group and an unsupervised group. In the supervised group is defined the certified Pulmonary Rehabilitation Protocol\nGROUP A :-\nSupervised group consists of Aerobic training Exercises , resistance exercise ,balance training exercise, Respiratory training exercises .The Exercise Training program is prescribed on the basis of FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Type, Time) principle. The exercise training program will be started from day 2 data will be calculated\n,\nstatistical analysis will be calculated .The treatment period of Supervised Group will be of six weeks\nGROUP B\n:- In Unsupervised groups same as group A Exercise Training Protocol will be given, detailed explanation of all exercises and techniques will be taught and performed by the participants on day 1 ,remaining sessions will be asked to perform at home ,handouts will be given to patients can contact through video calls and telephone I.e Tele- rehabilitation in between the treatment period . Treatment will be carried out for 6 weeks in each group. Tailored exercise prescription will be given. Termination indicators to training program will be-Temperature>38.2 degrees , Chest pain, chest tightness, Aggravated cough , Dizziness"

There is a limited number of literatures on the effect of exercise program on physical fitness and health status of patients with Post COVID 19 syndrome. The current study therefore uses the available evidence in COVID 19 patients to modify an exercise program and apply it to patients with COVID syndrome.
