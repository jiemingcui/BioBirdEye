            "content": "<p>Haemophilia is a recessive, X\u2010linked, congenital bleeding disease which occurs due to lack coagulation factor VIII or factor IX. This deficit is an effect of mutations in clotting factor genes (factor VIII in type A, and factor IX in type B). Occurrence of haemophilia is approximately 1 in 10 000 births.<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[i]</a> Haemophilia A is found more commonly in the population. Regardless of the type of haemophilia, the outcome is the same; people affected bleed longer than normal. In the healthy population, normal international units (IU) are 0.50-1.50 per milliliter of whole blood. People with mild haemophilia have levels of 0.05-0.4 IU, and people with moderate haemophilia have levels of 0.01-0.05 IU. Severe is below 0.01 IU.<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[ii]</a> People with mild haemophilia might experience bleeding after surgical procedures or major injury, while others may not experience bleeding episodes. People with moderate haemophilia bleed around once a month and rarely experience spontaneous bleeding. Those suffering from severe haemophilia bleed quite often into muscles or joints, and episodes might occur once or twice a week. Bleeding usually occurs spontaneously.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;In the annual global survey conducted across 116 countries by World Federation of Hemophilia in 2017, a total of 196,706 people have been identified with haemophilia. In Pakistan, among those who have been recorded, 1743 people were diagnosed with haemophilia, 250 had Von Willebrand\u2019s disease, and 121 had other associated bleeding disorders.<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[iii]</a> Psychosocial factors play a key role in quality of life (QoL) of patients with haemophilia (PwH).<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[iv]</a><sup>,</sup><a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>[v]</sup></a> As severity of hemophilia increases, the QoL in PwH decreases when compared with healthy population.<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[vi]</a> Self-esteem of males who have severe bleeding disorders is also considerably worse compared to that of their healthy peers, whereas females show significant differences.<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[vii]</a> Treatment for haemophilia is via factor replacement therapy, which may be given prophylactically, or as acute treatment.<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[viii]</a> Hemophilic arthropathy can be extremely painful, with knees, elbows and ankle most commonly being affected. Recurring bleeding in the joint can cause synovitis that can develop into arthropathy, which may later disrupt activities of daily living. The joint most commonly affected is the knee, with a simple act such as ambulating on level surfaces generating substantial force and stresses on the knee joint. Due to muscle weakness, the knee joint is further susceptible to weight bearing stresses, which results in a loop of persistent joint bleeds and rising synovitis which causes further muscle atrophy, eventually leading to severe arthropathy. <a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[ix]</a> The price of one injection of factor VIII in Pakistan is approximately USD 80/-<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[x]</a>. For an individual who requires 12-16 injections every month, the cost will be roughly&nbsp;USD 11,500 ~ USD 15,500/- anually.<sup>10</sup> The yearly minimum wage in Pakistan is <strong>USD $2,484.00</strong>,<strong> </strong>thus making it difficult to afford such treatment. Traditionally PwH were often advised against participating in sports due to possibility of injury, however, studies have tried to demonstrate the positive effects of exercise programs for PwH.</p>"

            "content": "Participant\u2019s height, weight and age will be recorded for pre-test anthropometric data. Height will be measured using a stadiometer, and weight will be measured with an electronic scale. Hemophilia Joint Health Score v2.1 and Manual Muscle Testing (Daniels and Worthingham\u2019s) for deltoid (anterior, middle and posterior fibers), biceps, triceps, quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles will be conducted pre and post-test. HEP-Test-Q will be assessed pre and post-test to note change in subjective QoL. Rating of perceived exertion (Borg rating of perceived exertion) will be assessed on every session to check progression in variables being tested. HEP-Test-Q and Rating of perceived exertion will be provided in Urdu for participants. Treatment sessions will be conducted twice a week, for eight weeks, amounting to a total of sixteen sessions. The control group will be administered a standard physical therapy intervention program which will consist of active muscle stretching and aerobic exercise. If participants drop out before completion of sessions, analysis will be done via intention to treat analysis. License has been obtained from the relevant authorities to use these questionnaires in this study.\nExercises will include:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flexion, extension and abduction at the shoulder joint for anterior, middle and posterior fibers of deltoid respectively\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flexion and extension at the elbow for biceps brachii and triceps trachii\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flexion and extension at the knee joint for quadriceps and hamstring muscles\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plantar flexion at the ankle joint for gastrocnemius and soleus\nThree sets of ten repetitions of each exercise will be done.\nThe intervention group will undergo a progressive resistance training program consisting of active muscle stretching and resistance training. Exercise for intervention group will consist of:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resisted flexion, extension and abduction at the shoulder joint for anterior, middle and posterior deltoid, using dumbbells\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resisted flexion and extension at the elbow for biceps brachii and triceps trachii, using dumbbells\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resisted flexion and extension of knee joint for quadriceps and hamstring muscles, using therabands\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resisted dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of gastrocnemius and soleus, using therabands\nResistance will be increased on basis of progressive overload principle. Three sets of ten repetitions will be performed per muscle group. Initial weight of the dumbbells will be one kilogram and will be increased by half kilogram per week. Therabands will be used to provide lower limb resistance. Resistance for therabands will be upgraded every two weeks. Treatment time per group will be approximately forty minutes. Exercises will be progressed in a gradual manner to give participants time to build muscle strength, and prevent any chance of injury. Participants will be given the option to withdraw from the study at any time."

Thirty patients will be allocated to control group, and thirty to intervention group. Controls will be administered active muscle stretching and aerobic exercises. Intervention group will be given active muscle stretching, and resistance training. Patients will be randomly allocated to each group. Anthropometric data will be measured pre-test to establish a baseline. Study variables include muscular strength, and quality of life.
