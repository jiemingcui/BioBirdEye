            "content": "Preparation of RNA samples\r\n\n\nTiming: 1h\r\n\n\n1. The quality of the starting RNA samples is critical for the success of the PEAT strategy. We recommend TRIzol reagent to isolate total RNA from higher eukaryotes \\(both animal and plant). For yeast cells, hot-phenol approach1 tends to give the most reproducible results. To avoid potential biases that may incur during library construction, it is preferable to start with ~150 \u03bcg total RNA if the sample is easy to be obtained. For low-abundance samples, it is possible to reduce the amount to 10 \u03bcg. In this protocol, we use Drosophila embryos to demonstrate the PEAT strategy. One can adapt the protocol to construct PEAT libraries for other species as well\r\n  \r\n\n\nRNA cleanup\r\n\n\nTiming: 1 h\r\n\n\n2. RNeasy Mini kit \\(QIAGEN) is used to remove genomic DNA contamination in RNA preparation. On-column DNase I digestion step is included according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol Starting with ~150 \u03bcg total RNA, the final product is eluted with 80 \u03bcl nuclease-free water.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. \\(Optional Step) The integrity of the purified RNA is checked with1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel \\(FA gel). Alternatively, Agilent RNA Nano Labchip can be used to determine the RNA quality. Proceed to the next step if the RNA samples pass quality control. \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPolyA+ RNA selection with Dynabeads \\(dT)25\r\n\n\nTiming: 3 h\r\n\n\n4. Perform two rounds of polyA+ selection with Dynabeads \\(dT)25 according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Use all of the purified total RNAs from the previous step and elute the polyA+ RNA with 30 \u03bcl elution buffer \\(10mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5).\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Lithium salt resulting from polyA+ selection step might affect downstream enzymatic activity. RNeasy MinRlute kit is therefore used to remove residual lithium by following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. We recommend to elute the column twice, each with 40 \u03bcl nuclease-free water. The resulting products are then quantified with a nanodrop spectrophotometer. From 150 \u03bcg total RNA, the typical yield of purified polyA+ RNA is 2-3 \u03bcg.\r\n  \r\n\n\nBacterial Alkaline Phosphatase \\(BAP) treatment\r\n\n\nTiming: 2.5 h\r\n\n\n6.

Perform ethanol precipitation by adding 20 \u03bcl 3 M NaOAc \\(pH 5.2), 2 \u03bcl GlycoBlue and 500 \u03bcl ethanol. Wash the pellet once with 70% ethanol, followed by adding 85.5 \u03bcl nuclease-free water to dissolve RNA.\r\n  Critical step: Completely removal of the phosphate group on the uncapped RNA molecules before TAP treatment is critical for reducing background noise. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase \\(TAP) treatment\r\n\n\nTiming: 2.5 h\r\n\n\n8.

Prepare the following reaction:\r\n  RCA product   2 \u03bcl\r\n\n\n10 x buffer 2 \\(NEB)   2 \u03bcl\r\n\n\n100 x BSA \\(NEB)   0.2 \u03bcl\r\n\n\nXhoI \\(NEB)   1 \u03bcl\r\n\n\nH2O   14.8 \u03bcl\r\n\n\nTotal reaction volume   20 \u03bcl\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n27. Incubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Take 10 \u03bcl reaction to run in a 1.5% agarose gel. Results passed QC: Majority of the RCA products were digested by XhoI and generate smear ranging from 200 bp to 1000 bp and peaked at ~400 bp.\r\n  \r\n\n\nPrecipitation of RCA products\r\n\n\nTiming: 1.5 h\r\n\n\n28. For each sample, combine 4 tubes of RCA products together. Add 120 \u03bcl nuclease-free water to bring a total volume of 200 \u03bcl. Extract once with phenol/chloroform then with chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. Qualify the RCA products by Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The typical yield is around 60 \u03bcg.\r\n  \r\n\n\nGeneration of ditag by MmeI digestion\r\n\n\nTiming: 2.5 h\r\n\n\n29. Prepare the following reaction in a 1.7 ml tube:\r\n  RCA product from previous step   16 \u03bcg\r\n\n\n10x buffer 4 \\(NEB)   18 \u03bcl\r\n\n\nSAM, dilute to 500 \u03bcM using 1x NEB buffer 4   20 \u03bcl\r\n\n\nMmeI, 2U/\u03bcl \\(NEB)   10 \u03bcl\r\n\n\nNuclease-free water add to   200 \u03bcl\r\n\n\nTotal reaction volume   200 \u03bcl\r\n\n\nTIP: The original concentration of SAM is 32 mM. Use 1x buffer 4 \\(NEB) to dilute SAM.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n30. Incubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. MmeI digestion enables the release of small fragment \\(\n94bp) which containing ditag3. Concentrate the reaction to 12 \u03bcl with two DNA clean & concentrator-5 columns \\(ZYMO). Load 6 \u03bcl of purified DNA to one lane \\(one sample has two lanes) in 6% acrylamide gel. We use 18 x 16 cm acylamide gel to obtain better separation of MmeI digested product \\(\n94 bp) from background. Run the vertical gel at 200 V for 1.5 h. Compare the intensity of bands with the DNA standard \\(100 bp band of Invitrogen\u2019s 10 bp DNA ladder), we estimate that the desired DNA fragment is ~7.2 pmol.\r\n  \r\n\n\nPurification of MmeI digested small fragment\r\n\n\nTiming: overnight\r\n\n\n31. Use a new Razor Blade \\(VWR) to cut the desired band \\(~94 bp) which contains both TSS sequence and 3\u2019 downstream tag. Elute each gel slice with 400 \u03bcl gel elution buffer \\(0.1% SDS, 0.2 NaCl, 10 mM MgOAc2). Rotate at least 6 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 \u00b0C.

Run the following PCR program: incubate for 30 sec at 98 \u00b0C, followed by a 2 cycles of \\(10 sec and 98 \u00b0C, 10 sec at 66 \u00b0C, 30 sec at 72\u00b0C) and 10 cycles of \\(10 sec and 98 \u00b0C, 10 sec at 69 \u00b0C, 30 sec at 72\u00b0C), additional extension for 10 min at 72 \u00b0C and then hold at 10 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\nQuality control step 3\r\n\n\nTiming: 0.5 h\r\n\n\n36. Take 3 \u03bcl of PCR product to run a 1.5% agarose gel. One should see a specific band of 213 bp. If very strong non-specific amplification occurs, perform size selection \\(~180 bp) after linker ligation.\r\n  TIP: A library with good quality should have a relatively strong band \\(~213 bp) compared to the primer dimers.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSize selection in an acrylamide gel\r\n\n\nTiming: overnight\r\n\n\n37. Use ZYMO DNA clean & concentrator-5 kit to purify the remaining 47 \u03bcl PCR product and elute with 6 \u03bcl nuclease-free water. Load the purified sample to an 8% acrylamide gel and run at 1 w for 1 hr. Stain the acrylamide gel with EtBr for 2 min and cut the ~213 bp band under UV transilluminator. Elute the gel slice with 400 \u03bcl gel elution buffer \\(0.1% SDS, 0.3M NaOAc, pH5.2) and rotate at room temperature for at least 6 h or at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Purify the final library with ZYMO DNA clean & concentrator-5 kit. Load multiple times for mixture more than 700 \u03bcl. Elute with 30 \u03bcl nuclease-free water. Quantify the final library by Qubit fluoromerter according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The concentration of our sample \\(fly 0-24h embryo) is 1.3 ng/\u03bcl.\r\n  TIP: This size selection step is to remove non-specific amplification. It helps to increase the quality of paired-end library.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nQuality control step 4\r\n\n\nWe use Sanger sequencing to evaluate the quality of the final TSS library.\r\n\n\nTiming: two days\r\n\n\n38. Use 5 \u03bcl out of 30 \u03bcl final library for the QC by Sanger sequencing. We obtained 20 qualified clones; 18 of the clones could be mapped to annotated Drosophila TSSs \\(\u00b1 250nt).\r\n  \r\n\n\nPaired-end sequencing by Illumina GAIIx\r\n\n\nTiming: 3~4 days\r\n\n\n39.

One possibility is less circular DNA is generated during circularization step. Always do quality control step 2 to make sure cDNA can be specifically amplified by primer pair Mme_F and Mme_R. Another reason is Phi29 DNA polymerase might be inactivated by UV treatment if the temperature gets too high during treatment. To solve this, make sure the PCR cap which contains enzyme meets cooled water in the well of the PCR cooler during the treatment. After adding water to the well of the PCR cooler, wait for at least 1 min to let the water to cool down to ~0 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSanger sequencing revealed high percentage of clones without built-in linkers:\r\n\n\nThe built-in linkers are used to distinguish if the <sub>20 nt tag is derived from the TSS side or from the 3\u2019 downstream region. Unsuccessful separation of the </sub>94 bp band from background is the main reason. To resolve this problem, always remember to use large acrylamide gel to better separate the intended band from background. In addition, cut the ~94 bp band as tight as possible.
