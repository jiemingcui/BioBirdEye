            "content": "Protein-RNA complexes regulate gene expression by controlling maturation, localization, translation and degradation of RNA. Mutation of even a single nucleotide or amino acid is sufficient to alter the recognition of the binding partners and leads to disease<sup>1, 2</sup>. Deciphering protein-RNA interactions lays the basis for the further functional and structural characterization of cognate protein-RNA complexes and sheds light on how specific intermolecular interactions regulate associated cellular processes. UV-induced protein-RNA crosslinking has been widely used to detect target transcripts bound by selected bait proteins by crosslinking and immunoprecipitation \\(CLIP) techniques with single nucleotide resolution<sup>3, 4</sup>. However, these techniques do not identify the nature of the interaction, the exact binding site of the protein or other functionally important proteins engaged in the RNP. Complementary to CLIP-techniques, UV-crosslinking and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry \\(LC-MS/MS) have been used to identify and discover RNA binding proteins \\(RBPs) bound to a specific subset of RNAs, but the exact position of the RBPs on the RNA has remained inaccessible<sup>5-8</sup>. Thus, the detection of protein-RNA interactions at single residue resolution has only been possible by classical de-novo structure determination methods. Here, we provide a protocol \\(see Fig. 1 for an overview) that combines segmental <sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-isotope labeling of RNA<sup>9</sup> with UV-crosslinking of protein-RNA complexes and LC-MS/MS. We term the method \u201cCLIR-MS/MS\u201d for CrossLinking of segmentally Isotope labeled RNA and MS/MS. It has the ability to decipher protein-RNA interactions at single amino acid and single nucleotide resolution, requires only small sample amounts and is in principle not limited by the size or flexibility of the investigated RNP. We successfully applied the method on the U1 small nuclear RNP \\(U1snRNP) and the 58 kDa RBP Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1 \\(PTBP1) in complex with a large \\(88 nucleotides), structured RNA sequence derived from the Internal Ribosomal Entry Site \\(IRES) of Encephalomyocarditis Virus. U1snRNP consists of 10 different proteins bound to a large, heavily structured RNA and is an essential component of the spliceosome<sup>10</sup>. The multifunctional PTBP1 consists of four RNA Recognition Motifs that bind primarily CU-rich RNA elements and acts e.g. as alternative splicing factor<sup>11</sup> and IRES trans-acting factor<sup>12, 13</sup>. \r\n\n\nCLIR-MS/MS takes advantage of the use of segmentally isotope labeled RNA that is combined with equimolar amounts of unlabeled RNA of the same sequence prior to complex formation. The combined sample is then photo-crosslinked and the product is enzymatically treated with a protease to generate MS-compatible peptides and with nucleases to trim the RNA adducts crosslinked to specific peptide sequences. The resulting peptides are analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The modified peptide is sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and the identity of the peptide as well as the modified amino acid and the composition of the RNA adduct can be deduced from the fragment ion spectra. Crosslinks that occurred at the differentially labeled segment appear as peak doublets of approximately 1:1 ratio in the precursor ion spectrum. The peak splitting corresponds to the mass difference of the RNA adduct and precursor ions corresponding to peptides crosslinked to the differentially labeled RNA segment can be identified. The minimal mass difference of 11 Da \\(<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-labeled vs. unlabeled uracil) is large enough to avoid interference with natural isotope patterns and the differential isotope labeling adds an additional selection criterion for mass spectrometric and subsequent computational fragment ion analysis, thereby reducing the false positive detection rate. Furthermore, the focus on differentially labeled RNA adducts allows to limit the range of possible interaction sites to the respective <sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-labeled segment. In combination with the detection of mono-, di- and trinucleotide modifications occurring at the same amino acid, up to single nucleotide resolution on the RNA side can be achieved. Segmental isotope labeling of RNA is _per se_ not restricted by size and any type of labeled RNA-segment can be used. Thus, combinations of different labeling schemes like deuterated RNA segments or chemically synthesized 4-thio-uridinylated RNA are compatible with the method<sup>9</sup>."

This would allow further refinement of segmental isotope labeling \\(smaller segments) or for mutagenesis studies. Single nucleotide and single amino acid resolution can be generally expected if the composition of the detected RNA adducts is unique throughout the labeled RNA segment. This in turn means that the design of the RNA segments should take the RNA primary sequence into account and will benefit from prior knowledge about potential binding preferences of the protein. For all PTBP1-RRMs, we could detect mono- and di-nucleotide adducts and in favorable cases even tri-nucleotide modifications. Thus, the sequence information from the CLIR-MS/MS data covers usually up to four nucleotides and in favorable cases up to six nucleotides. CLIR-MS/MS derived protein-RNA restraints can provide crucial information for the refinement of low-resolution structures and can be combined with other restraints in an integrative structural biology approach."

The precise knowledge of the RNA/protein interaction sites in such complexes provides essential information for understanding ribonucleoprotein \\(RNP) regulated processes in health and disease. We established an efficient technique that combines segmental isotope labeling of RNA with photo-crosslinking and tandem mass spectrometry. It resolves protein-RNA interactions in RNPs assembled _in vitro_, at single amino acid and single nucleotide level resolution in the same analysis. Information on these zero-length crosslinks can be used to guide further functional assays and as intermolecular distance restraints, thus supporting atomic scale modeling of protein-RNA complexes in an integrative structural biology approach. Optimally, the mapping of protein-RNA interactions can be achieved for a given complex within three weeks. This protocol accompanies Dorn et al, Nature Methods, published online 27 March 2017 \\(doi:10.1038/nmeth.4235).",
