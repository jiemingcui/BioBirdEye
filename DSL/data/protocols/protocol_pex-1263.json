            "content": "<p>Exosomes are membrane-enclosed vesicles with a size range of 30-150 nm that can be released by almost all cell types. Since exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cellular regulation, and the development of diseases, exosomes have been isolated from different biofluids such as plasma, urine, and saliva for effective investigation of various exosomal cargos. However, exosomes based biological investigation and clinical translation remain challenging due to the complexity of biological fluidics and technical limitations during exosome sample preparation. This protocol describes an automatic exosome purification method using EXODUS that has the capability to isolate EVs from different biofluids with a significantly improved throughput, stability, exosome yield, and purity. The method will include the operation and the maintenance of the EXODUS system and the procession of different biofluids. All relevant data of our experiments are detailed in a manuscript submitted to <em>Nature Methods</em> for publication (Y. Chen, <em>et.al</em>, Exosome Detection via the Ultrafast-isolation System: EXODUS, Nature Methods).</p>"
