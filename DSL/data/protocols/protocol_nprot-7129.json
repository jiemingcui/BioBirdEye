            "content": "Microalgae, macroalgae and bacteria in the oceans produce massive amounts of low molecular weight zwitterionic metabolites that serve as osmolytes, cryoprotectants and antioxidants.<sup>1,2</sup> It has early been recognized that dimethylsulfoniopropionate \\(DMSP) plays a major role and substantially fuels the organosulfur cycle with annual production rates of several petagrams.<sup>3,4</sup> The analytic methods to detect and quantify DMSP were nearly exclusively based on an indirect protocol that involves base mediated DMSP cleavage and detection of the released dimethylsulfide.<sup>5</sup> However, a direct detection of zwitterionic metabolites showed that the chemistry of this compound class is unexpectedly complex.<sup>6</sup> In fact, the oversimplified indirect determination led to a misassignment of up to 10 % of the marine dimethylsulfide sources.<sup>7</sup> The direct quantification of the polar osmolytes is based on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography \\(HILIC). Here, weak electrostatic interactions between the charged analytes and zwitterionic stationary phase result in selectivity for polar analytes that could not be achieved with traditional HPLC columns. The analysis revealed novel key players in the marine organosulfur cycle. We recently reported the discovery of a structurally unusual zwitterionic metabolite dimethylsulfoxonium propionate \\(DMSOP) that is produced by several DMSP-containing microalgae and marine bacteria.<sup>8</sup> The protocol introduced here illustrates how this sulfoxonium metabolite can be extracted and quantified. The method can also be used for the determination of other zwitterionic metabolites with minor variations. In-depth investigation of this chemistry will be required to perceive the complexity of the flux of highly polar low molecular weight metabolites in the oceans."

            "header": "Procedure",
            "content": "The procedure is divided in three sections \\(I. Cultivation / Sampling; II. Sample preparation for the determination of cellular DMSOP; III. Chromatography and mass spectrometry). Details for each section are described below. Note: The protocol generates samples that allow the determination of other low molecular weight zwitterionic metabolites like DMSP, glycine betaine or gonyol. For these and other zwitterionic metabolites the protocol can be followed with only one adjustment: appropriate standards of the analytes of interest would have to be used instead of the DMSOP standard. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nI. Cultivation / Sampling\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nUtilize any culture of microalgae or field sample of phytoplankton. The amount of culture / field sample depends on the cell count, cell volume, and the content of DMSOP or of other zwitterionic low molecular weight metabolites of the tested alga. Further, the sensitivity of the LC/MS equipment has to be taken into consideration. The protocol introduced below has been optimized for 100 \u2013 200 mL exponential phase cultures or 20 \u2013 50 mL stationary phase cultures of diatoms \\(here _Skeletonema costatum_) or 100 \u00b5L of dense bacterial cultures \\(here _Pelagibacter bermudensis_) and measurement on an Orbitrap Q-Exactive LC/MS instrument. The protocol can be readily scaled up and down.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nII. Sample preparation for the determination of cellular DMSOP\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMake sure you have ready the equipment and solutions before the start of the procedure. Label the vials before the start of the experiment. The workflow should be carried out without interruption if quantitative information is required. If required, the protocol could only be paused after point 5. \\(A) or 3. \\(B). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA) Extraction of phytoplankton cells\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Take a specific volume from your experimental culture using a serological pipette and transfer it into an Erlenmeyer flask.\r\n  Note: The volume is dependent on growth phase and cell density: for exponential phase diatom cultures use 100 \u2013 200 mL, for stationary phase 20 \u2013 50 mL. \r\n\n\nNote: Determine cell counts and / or chlorophyll a content of the culture and document the precise volume. This information will be required to calculate the cellular DMSOP content / the DMSOP concentration.\r\n\n\n2. Filter the culture under reduced pressure \\(400 mbar) over a GF/C grade microfiber filter using the filtration unit. Use a two-way stopcock to control the vacuum. Close the stopcock as soon as the filter is dry. \r\n  Note: The filtration should be carried out quickly and the filter should be transferred directly once the filtration is terminated. \r\n\n\n3. Remove the glass part of the filtration unit and fold the filter on the glass frit two times using tweezers. \r\n  4. Using tweezers transfer the filter to a 4 mL screw top glass vial containing 1 mL of methanol.\r\n  5. Seal the vial with a Teflon lined screw cap and vortex it for 30 s.\r\n  Note: You can store the sample at  20 \u00b0C for several weeks without loss \\(for long-term storage over several months\u2019  80 \u00b0C storage might be recommended). Note: If you notice precipitate formation after freezing centrifuge the sample and transfer the supernatant as described in step 6.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6. Transfer 50 \u00b5L of the extract into a micro glass insert and dilute with 100 \u00b5L of a mixture of acetonitrile and water \\(9:1 v/v).\r\n  Note: The dilution can be adjusted depending on the concentration of the extract.\r\n\n\nNote: If you use an internal standard \\(procedure III B), add it here.\r\n\n\n7. Put the micro glass insert into a 15 mL Falcon tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 4500 rcf. Transfer the supernatant to another micro glass insert.\r\n  8. Put the insert with the probe into a 1.5 mL screw top glass vial equipped with a spring to adjust the insert, close the lid and put it into the autosampler of the LC/MS system. Inject 5 \u00b5L to the LC/MS.\r\n  \r\n\n\nB) Extraction of bacterial cells\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n1. Take 100 \u00b5L of the bacterial culture and transfer it to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\r\n  2. Centrifuge it for 5 min at 16,100 rcf.\r\n  Note: If you do not see a cell pellet repeat the centrifugation for another 30 min.\r\n\n\n3. Remove and discard the supernatant by pipetting.\r\n  Pipette 100 \u00b5L of a mixture of acetonitrile and water \\(9:1 v/v) on the cell pellet and vortex for 30 s. \r\n\n\nNote: If you use an internal standard \\(procedure III B), add it here.\r\n\n\nNote: You can store the sample at -20 \u00b0C for several days \\(for long-term storage over several months\u2019  80 \u00b0C storage might be recommended). \r\n\n\n4. Put the tube on ice and disrupt the cells by sonication using six 10 s pulses \\(40% intensity) in the ultrasound homogenizer.\r\n  5. Centrifuge the sample for 5 min at 16,100 rcf and transfer the supernatant into the micro glass insert of a 1.5 mL screw top glass vial equipped with a spring to hold the insert and close the lid. Note: The supernatant has to be free of any precipitate; re-centrifuge if required. \r\n  6. Inject 5 \u00b5L into the LC/MS system.\r\n  \r\n\n\nIII.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Zwitterionic metabolites from marine phytoplankton and bacteria play essential physiological roles in these organisms. Especially dimethylsulfoniopropionate \\(DMSP) and the newly discovered dimethylsulfoxoniumpropionate \\(DMSOP) are also central in the marine sulfur cycle. This protocol describes the extraction, sample preparation, and quantification of DMSOP. Chromatographic separation is based on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography \\(HILIC) and detection is done by mass spectrometry on standard LC/MS instruments.  The protocol also covers the quantification of DMSP, dimethylsulfonioacetate \\(DMSA), gonyol, and the nitrogen-containing zwitterion glycine betaine. We introduce methods for the investigation of phytoplankton cultures, phytoplankton field samples, and bacteria cultures. Established methods for the estimation of DMSP are is based on the quantification of dimethylsulfide that is released during base treatment of DMSP. Our protocol now allows distinguishing between different DMS releasing zwitterions and to cover also other metabolites of this class that are not liberating DMS upon base treatment. It works universally with microalgae and bacteria and can easily be adapted to macroalgae.  With standard culture samples following the protocol requires less than two hours.",
