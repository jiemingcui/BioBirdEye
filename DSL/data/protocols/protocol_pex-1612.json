            "content": "<p>Both traditional two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-SDS-PAGE)<sup>1</sup> and 2D difference GE (2D-DIGE)<sup>2</sup> are established techniques for the separation of protein lysates with the latter providing improved gel comparability in addition. DIGE was developed to identify changes in the concentration of proteins between different sample states such as normal and stimulated cells. It is based on replicates and uses related fluorescent dyes to distinguish the different analytes. DIGE is very valuable in comparative proteomics, but it cannot be applied to singular samples, which only arrive sporadically and need to be compared to archived information, as is, for instance, the case in field studies of aeroallergens<sup>3</sup> or in rare diseases. In fact, reproducibility has always been the major drawback of GE, because gel-to-gel variation is difficult to overcome<sup>1,2</sup>. In order to fill this gap we introduce a reference, which allows the comparison of gel-separated protein data generated in different laboratories or over long periods of time. To that end, we combine elements of 1D- and 2D-PAGE as well as 2D-DIGE (Fig. 1)<sup>4</sup>. Thereby, the procedure to separate the analyte proteome is the same as in regular 2D-PAGE. However, in order to co-run reference substances, holes for protein marker solutions are punched across the 2D-gel close to the well for the p<em>I</em>-strip. When running the second dimension of such a gel, both the analyte proteins in the p<em>I</em>-strip, preseparated in the first dimension by isoelectric focussing (IEF), and the standard proteins in the holes are separated at the same time, the latter <em>de facto</em> undergoing a 1D-PAGE experiment. For the distinction of reference and analyte proteins, they are labelled with different fluorescent dyes such as those used in DIGE<sup>2</sup>. In this way, a quasi-internal gel standard grid is created on the gel, which allows the correlation of the analyte spot coordinates to reference landmarks<sup>5</sup>. We named the experiment comparative fluorescence GE (CoFGE)<sup>6</sup>. As long as it is performed with the same type of p<em>I</em>-strip and identical marker proteins, <em>in silico</em> matching of independent datasets is possible<sup>4,7</sup>. An exemplary dataset for the separation of <em>Escherichia coli</em> lysate, our test analyte<sup>6,8</sup>, is shown in Fig. 1.</p><p>CoFGE was first developed for vertical 2D-PAGE using a 1D-PAGE comb for the generation of the marker wells<sup>5,6</sup> and it is still performed in this way by independent users<sup>9,10</sup>. However, we found it much more convenient to apply CoFGE to horizontal GE<sup>8</sup> as illustrated in Fig. 1, which has a number of advantages in itself. The resolution is higher and protein spots are sharper, there is no need to handle large buffer volumes, and gel distortions (e.g., \u201csmiling effect\u201d) are reduced as a result of better cooling<sup>11,12</sup>. For vertical GE, a stacking gel for the application of the references needs to be casted<sup>5,6</sup>, which is not necessary in horizontal GE, because ready-made gels are now commercially available, which include the wells for the reference grid (Mercator gels, Serva Electrophoresis). Alternatively, the slots for the marker wells can be manually punched out in regular 2D-gels using pipette tips as we did initially<sup>8</sup>. </p><p>The CoFGE method as described above does not take into account the variability resulting from the first dimension (IEF). We have, therefore, introduced azo-dyes as marker substances for correction<sup>13</sup>. However, this additional protocol step is optional for most purposes when state-of-the-art high-quality p<em>I</em>-strips are used. </p><p>Fluorescence intensity correlates with protein concentration so that it is possible with CoFGE to estimate the protein amount in analyte gel spots. For that purpose, the reference proteins are applied in different concentrations to the marker slots and used for calibration<sup>14,15</sup>. </p><p>Depending on the overall goal of a project, be it a comparison of gel images in a short-term study or an investigation carried out over several years, some thought has to be spent on experimental design<sup>4,7</sup>. The analysis of a comparatively small gel set can simply be performed by choosing one of its members as the master gel. All reference grids from this set will then be correlated to this master grid and, subsequently, all analyte gel images will be adjusted using their individually corrected reference grids. In case of a long-term study such as the generation of a special 2D-gel image and protein spot database, the master grid needs to be defined at the very beginning. To that end, replicate gel runs of the reference proteins are used to calculate a fused image. This \u201cideal\u201d gel image will serve as the reference grid image for warping of gels throughout the project. Especially in extensive long studies, it is important to observe the protocol and use the same p<em>I</em>-strips and reference proteins throughout the project; otherwise, gel matching will not be possible. </p><p>CoFGE takes advantage of the same type of fluorescent labels as DIGE and is thus as sensitive (detection limit 0.5 fmol protein) and in the same way linear over a 410,000-fold concentration range<sup>2</sup>. We use two well-matched fluorescent dyes such as Cy3 and Cy5 or related paired dye products such as Sci3 and Sci5 or GDyes. Image analysis requires a high-quality fluorescence scanner, in our case the Typhoon 9400 imager (GE Healthcare), which provides three-laser illumination of which only two lasers are typically used.</p><p>The protocol described here outlines the steps we use in performing a CoFGE experiment<sup>16</sup>. </p><p>For method development we use <em>E. coli</em> lysate. CoFGE is otherwise applicable to any sample, which can be separated with traditional 2D-PAGE. CoFGE suffers from the limitations inherent to 2D-PAGE<sup>1</sup> such as difficulties with the separation of hydrophobic proteins, but it is otherwise a major improvement towards standardisation of gel electrophoresis. It is a sensitive and robust approach to generate reproducible spot coordinates for proteins separated by 2D-PAGE with the added bonus of possible quantification.&nbsp;</p>"

The analyte proteome is separated by IEF as in regular 2D-PAGE. The gel for the second dimension, however, contains marker slots close to the channel for the pI-strip, which are filled with a reference protein mix (R1-R8). During GE, both the analyte and the marker proteins are separated and the latter experience the same gel distortions as the former. A fluorescence scanner separates the images for analyte and reference grid, respectively. The inset shows an exemplary gel for the separation of E. coli lysate (red, marker grid in green) as is achieved with the protocol below. Subsequently, analyte spots (A1-A5) are associated with reference landmarks in silico with 2D-PAGE analysis software capable of warping (see, for example, spots A2 and A4).",

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (CoFGE) is a special version of two-dimensional polyacrylamide GE (2D-PAGE) and related to difference GE (2D-DIGE). It provides reproducibility and standardisation for 2D-PAGE by introducing a reference to the experiment. CoFGE uses different fluorescent labels to distinguish analyte and a marker protein mixture. The method allows <em>in silico</em> correction of the assignment of gel-separated proteins based on the co-run references, which form a grid of landmarks across the entire gel. The variability of spot coordinates is reduced to ~1% error and data can thus be compared to results generated independently with the same method. In this way, searchable repositories of gel-separated proteins become feasible. In addition, the CoFGE experimental principle can be used for protein quantification by applying the proteins of the marker grid in different concentrations. Here we present the protocol for conducting a CoFGE experiment, which takes about 2 days to complete for a technician skilled in GE.</p>",
