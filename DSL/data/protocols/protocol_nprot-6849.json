            "content": "Mammalian development occurs through the complex interactions between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Efforts to tease these interactions apart, however, have been hampered by the limited amount of available material and by the difficulty of genetically manipulating every embryonic or extraembryonic tissue separately.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOn the other hand, embryonic and extraembryonic stem cells provide a limitless source of material which holds the potential to differentiate into any embryonic and extraembryonic tissue. Yet, most attempts to date to aggregate stem cells have led to the formation of embryoid bodies, which, while capturing some features of mammalian development, do not organize into the correct embryonic architecture or have limited developmental potential1,2. Hence, it would be beneficial to combine the strengths of these two approaches by generating robust and reproducible in vitro models of embryo development. These models would enable capturing the complexity of embryonic cellular interactions and architecture while at the same time retaining the amenability to genetic manipulation of cell culture systems.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTo this aim, we have developed an approach to combine embryonic3, trophoblast4 and extraembryonic endoderm5 stem cells \\(which are derived from epiblast, extraembryonic ectoderm and primitive endoderm comprising the mouse embryo, respectively) into structures that self-organise to resemble the early postimplantation mouse embryos. We named these structures ETX embryos and here we explain how to generate them. ETX embryos resemble embryos from peri implantation to gastrulation, morphologically and transcriptionally. As ETX embryos develop, they undergo morphogenesis to recapitulate key spatio-temporal events of gastrulation, including mesoderm and definitive endoderm specification."

Change media the following day and then every other day\r\n\n\n?Troubleshooting 1\r\n\n\n6) Culture Xen cells in gelatinized plates with C-ETX medium. \r\n\n\n7) Passage them at 80% confluency in the same manner as ES and TS cells \\(Figure 1a). \r\n\n\n8) Replate Xen cells at a dilution between 1:5 and 1:10 on a new plate coated with gelatin.

After 2 batches of C-ETX medium have been made, discard the plate of MEFs.\r\n\n\nETX embryos generation: \r\n\n\n\u2022 AggreWell Setup\r\n\n\n16) Place a new AggreWell in the biosafety cabinet and aliquot 1 mL of Rinsing Solution in each well to be used. \r\n\n\n17) Spin the plate at 2000 x g for 5 minutes and incubate at room temperature in the biosafety cabinet for 30 minutes. \r\n\n\n18) Following incubation, aspirate the Rinsing Solution and wash each well once with 2 mL of 1x PBS. \r\n\n\n19) Remove PBS and place 500 uL of C-ETX medium for each well to be used, careful not to introduce bubbles. \r\n\n\n20) Check the plate under the microscope.

If there are bubbles, spin again at 2000 x g for 5 min.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Cell Suspension Preparation\r\n\n\n21) Prepare gelatin-coated wells which will be used to deplete the feeders. For instance, if the cells are grown in 6-well dishes and 1 well of ES cells and 1 well of TS cells will be used for the experiment, coat 2 wells of a 6-well dish with gelatin. If cells are grown in a 12-well dish, coat 2 wells of a 12-well dish and so on. \r\n\n\n22) Leave the plate with gelatin in the hood at room temperature. \r\n\n\n23) Dissociate ESC and TSC colonies to single cells by incubation with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37\u00b0C for 3 min. \r\n\n\n?

Resuspend in 2 mL for plating in a 6-well dish, 1 mL for a 12-well dish\r\n\n\n27) Remove gelatin from the previously prepared plate, plate the cell suspension and incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. \r\n\n\n28) When there are 10 minutes left to this incubation, dissociate the Xen cells in a similar manner, centrifuge and resuspend them in C-ETX medium. Since they were not grown on MEFs, there is no need to perform a gelatin-enrichment step. \r\n\n\n29) When the 20 minute incubation is complete, collect the supernatant containing the pure population of ES and TS cells in separate 15 mL Falcon tubes. \r\n\n\n?Troubleshooting 5\r\n\n\n30) Quantify the concentration of ES, TS and Xen cells with a haemocytometer\r\n\n\n31) Calculate the volume of suspension containing 7200 ES cells, 19200 TS cells and 5400 Xen cells.\r\n\n\n32) Scale up this number of cells according to the number of wells to be used in the experiment. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 AggreWell Plating\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n33) Prepare C-ETX medium with Rock inhibitor Y27632, 1 mL of C-ETX medium with Rock inhibitor \\(at a concentration of 7.5 nM), per well is needed. Addition of 1 mL of this media to the previous 500 uL in the well will bring the final concentration of Rock inhibitor to 5 nM.\r\n\n\n34) Add the correct volume of ES, TS and Xen cells to a 15 mL Falcon tube and centrifuge them for 4 minutes at 1000 rpm. \r\n\n\n35) Remove the supernatant and resuspend in C-ETX medium with Rock inhibitor. \r\n\n\n36) Add 1 mL of cell suspension to each well of the AggreWell plate dropwise and homogenously. Avoid making bubbles. The final volume of media is 1.5 mL/well.\r\n\n\n37) Centrifuge the plate at 100 x g for 3 minutes to collect cells at the bottom of each well. \r\n\n\n? Troubleshooting 6\r\n\n\n38) Optional: Fill the surrounding empty wells with 1x PBS to prevent media evaporation\r\n\n\n39) Place the plate in the incubator. This is Day0.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Experimental course\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n40) The following day \\(Day1) gently perform 1mL media change twice on each well of the AggreWell plate with C-ETX medium without Rock inhibitor. Be very gentle, as the cells will lift off the bottom of the plate if the media change is too vigorous.\r\n\n\n41) On Day2, change only 1 mL of C-ETX medium with more C-ETX medium\r\n\n\n42) On Day3, prepare IVC1 and equilibrate it for 20 minutes in the incubator. Change media by removing 1.2 mL of C-ETX medium and replacing it gently with 1.5 mL of IVC1\r\n\n\n43) On Day4, prepare IVC2 and equilibrate it for 20 minutes in the incubator. Change media by removing 1.5 mL of IVC1 and replacing it gently with 1.5 mL of IVC2\r\n\n\n44) On Day5, prepare more IVC2 as before and replace 1 mL of IVC2 with fresh IVC2\r\n\n\n45) On Day6, prepare more IVC2 as before and replace 1 mL of IVC2 with fresh IVC2\r\n\n\n?

An ETX embryo is defined as a structure with an adjoining ES and TS compartment surrounded by an outer layer of Xen cells. Out of the structures in the AggreWell, 70% comprise all three cell type, and out of these, 20% assume the typical mouse postimplantation egg cylinder structure."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "We report here an approach to combine embryonic \\(ES), trophoblast \\(TS) and extraembryonic endoderm \\(XEN) stem cells and allow them to develop in vitro. Over a short period of time, these cells self-organize and assemble into structures which are very similar to mouse postimplantation embryos both at the morphological and transcriptional level. We named these structures ETX embryos. This protocol can be used with any combination of ES, TS and Xen cells and we believe it will be very useful to test the importance of specific genes during mouse embryonic development without having to generate a transgenic mouse. The protocol relies on standard and widely available tissue culture equipment and is completed within or at most 6 days.",
