Using immunomagnetic nanobeads, i.e. antibodies coupled to magnetic beads, which bind specifically to a target protein found in or on a cell, these devices can be used to sort heterogenous cell populations based on the expression of the target protein. Although the low manufacturing and operating costs and high speed at which these devices operate have made them a competitive alternative to cell sorting by FACS, the limited throughput of these small devices has consistently remained a barrier to adoption for large-scale applications. </p><p>Building upon the principles of previously developed immunomagnetic microfluidic sorters (Ref. 2) to improve throughput and devising a method to operate up to 30 chips in parallel (MICS), we have successfully demonstrated the sorting of a large live cell population into three outlet populations in one hour while maintaining high cell viability for the purpose of genome-scale phenotypic screening (Ref. 1). The observed sorting capacity of up to 1 billion cells per hour surpasses the throughput achievable by FACS, the gold standard for phenotypic cell sorting.</p><p>The protocol presented here outlines how to fabricate and operate microfluidic chips for performing MICS. In addition, we encourage users to consult the supplementary material of Ref. 2, which also outlines the microfabrication of microfluidic chips. Users of this protocol should have previous experience with labelling cells (e.g. for flow cytometry or sorting on MACS columns) and have basic experience with 3D printing and microfabrication.</p>"

These syringes correspond to low (20ml), medium (10ml) and high (3ml) outlets. A 3D-printed holder can be used to hold up to 5 sets of syringes per pump. Ensure the syringes are fully depressed, the pump has been set to withdraw mode and the 20ml syringe is selected in the pump menu. Select desired flow rate.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Connect outlet tubing to outlet syringes, ensure the tube on the outside of the chip is connected to the 3ml syringe, and the inside-most tubing is connected to the 20ml syringe.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Run pump for 2min to remove any air in tubing.\n10.\u00a0Place chip on top of magnet, centred overtop of magnetic guides and not on inlets/outlets.

Individual chips can be \u201cstopped\u201d by clamping outlet tubing and removing tubing from outlet syringes. This allows the pump to run other chips while disconnecting others.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once all chips are finished, clamp outlet tubes.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove tubing from all outlet syringes.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each outlet syringe, label a 15ml falcon tube and weigh the tube.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fill each falcon tube with the contents of the appropriate syringe.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Weigh the falcon tubes again, the mass difference can be used to calculate the volume of fluid collected, assuming a density of 1g/ml.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take a small (10\u00b5l) sample from each tube for automated cell counting and viability measurement.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use remaining cells for future purposes depending on the application of this platform.\nAnalysis\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculate the efficiency of each chip (percentage of cells in each outlet) and the recovery (total cells collected/total cells in sample*100%).

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Genome-scale functional genetic screens can be used to interrogate determinants of protein expression modulation of a target of interest. Such phenotypic screening approaches typically require sorting of large numbers of cells (&gt;10<sup>8</sup>). In conventional cell sorting techniques (i.e. fluorescence-activated cell sorting), sorting time, associated with high instrument and operating costs and loss of cell viability, are limiting to the scalability and throughput of these screens. We recently established a rapid and scalable high-throughput microfluidic cell sorting platform (MICS) using immunomagnetic nanoparticles to sort cells in parallel capable of sorting more than 10<sup>8</sup> HAP1 cells in under one hour while maintaining high levels of cell viability (Ref. 1). This protocol outlines how to set-up MICS for large-scale phenotypic screens in mammalian cells. We anticipate this platform being used for genome-wide functional genetic screens as well as other applications requiring the sorting of large numbers of cells based on protein expression.&nbsp;</p>",
