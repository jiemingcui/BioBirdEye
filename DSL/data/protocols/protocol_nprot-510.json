            "content": "Basophils are one of effector cells in type 2 immune responses that critically are associated with allergic inflammation and infections with helminth parasites. Recent findings that basophils produce a large amount of Th2 cytokines \\(IL-4 and IL-6) has provided new insights into the possible role of basophils in the initiation phase, in addition to the effector phase, of type 2 immune responses. However, basophils occupy only 1% or less in blood, bone marrow and spleen, making it difficult to analyze their function.\r\n\n\nHere we establish a method for expressing exogenous proteins and their mutants in cultured basophils through retroviral infection. In combination with cultured basophils from gene-manipulated mice, this method, overcoming the paucity of basophils, allows us to examine the requirement of various signal transducers in interleukin 3-induced production of Th2 cytokines."

Collect retrovirus-containing supernatants 48 hours after transfection, and concentrate 10-fold by centrifugation \\(8000 g, 12 hours, 4\u00b0C).\r\n  3. Filtrate virus supernatants through 0.22\u03bcm pore PVDF membrane. The filtrated supernatants can be stored for up to one week at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Infection of BM-derived basophils with retroviruses**\r\n\n\n4. Isolate bone marrow \\(BM) cells from femurs and tibias of 8-12 week old mice.\r\n  5. Culture whole BM cells at 2 to 2.5 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells/ml in 10 ml of penicillin and streptomycin, 2mM L-glutamine, 50 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum-containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with recombinant mouse IL-3 \\(5 ng/ml) for 9 days with medium changed every 3 days.\r\n  6.

Treat 12-well plates with RetroNectin solution \\(50 \u00b5g/ml in PBS) for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 minutes. \r\n  8. Incubate the treated plates with the virus supernatants for 4 hours at 30\u00b0C. Add enriched BM-derived basophils \\(0.5 to 1 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells/ml) and culture for 2 days for infection.\r\n  9. Recover infected cells and wash with RPMI 1640 containing 2% FBS.\r\n  10. For stimulating with IL-3, infected BM-derived basophils are \u2018starved\u2019 by culturing in culture media without IL-3 for 12 to 18 hours before enrich rat CD2\n+\ncells with IMag system and/or AutoMACS."
