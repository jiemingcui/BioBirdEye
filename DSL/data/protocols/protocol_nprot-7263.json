            "content": "miRNAs are 21-24 nucleotide small RNAs regulating gene expression majorly at post-transcriptional level<sup>1, 2</sup>. The partial complementarity between a miRNA and its target mRNA leads to the destabilization and/or translational repression of the target mRNA, while the full or near full complementarity between a miRNA and its target mRNA leads to the cleavage of the target mRNA at specific positions<sup>3-5</sup>. miRNAs play essential roles in a variety of physiologic and pathologic processes in plants and animals<sup>6-8</sup>. Many miRNAs are only expressed in specific tissues, cell types, and developmental or disease stages<sup>9, 10</sup>. As a result, miRNA profiles have been successfully used to characterize the developmental lineage and differentiation status of human tumors, and in many cases are more accurate and informative than mRNA profiles<sup>11</sup>. A reporter for miRNA activity will be extremely useful for tracking differentiation status of stem cells and disease progression. However, due to the inhibitory nature of miRNAs on gene expression, a reporter that is activated by miRNAs has not been made possible. Furthermore, expansion the application of miRNAs rather than just as inhibitory tools remains to be challenging.\r\n\n\nThe type II CRISPR system has recently been repurposed to a programmable gene editing system in plants, animals and microbes<sup>12, 13</sup>. Guided by a programmable chimeric CRISPR single guide RNA \\(sgRNA), a Cas9 nuclease is recruited and induces a double-stranded break \\(DSB) at complementary genomic sequences. Furthermore, the nuclease-deficient Cas9 \\(dCas9) retains the ability to target genomic DNA without cleaving it<sup>14</sup>. When fused with different effector proteins, dCas9 system has been engineered as a platform to regulate transcription<sup>15, 16</sup>, modify epigenetic status<sup>17, 18</sup> and mutate DNA bases at specific genomic loci<sup>19, 20</sup>. Traditionally, U6 or H1 promoters are used to driven sgRNAs expression while sgRNAs transcribed by Pol II RNA polymerase are inactive<sup>21</sup>, probably due to the 5' Cap and 3' polyA tail structures. Here, using a miRNA-mediated sgRNA releasing strategy from the inactive pre-sgRNA, we created a CRISPR-Cas9 platform that can be turned on by specific endogenous or exogenous miRNA/siRNAs. We show that this system can be adapted as miRNA sensors and cell type-specific genome regulation tools.\r\n\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1a, the key component for our miRNA-mediated sgRNA production strategy is a sgRNA precursor \\(pre-sgRNA), in which a sgRNA sequence is flanked by two miRNA complementary binding sites. Throughout this protocol, pre-sgRNAs are transcribed by RNA pol II under the control of CAGGS promoter, therefore can not be processed to functional sgRNAs due to the 5' Cap and 3' polyA tail structures. In the presence of cognate miRNAs, functional sgRNAs should then be released by AGO2-mediated cleavage reaction. Combined with different Cas9/dCas9-effector proteins, this platform may be adapted for genome editing, epigenetic modifications and regulating gene expression upon induction by specific miRNAs. As shown in Figure 1b, when combined with dCas9-VPR<sup>22</sup>, in which three transcription activators including VP64, P65 and RTA are fused to the C terminus of dCas9, and a fluorescent protein reporter, this platform can be designed as miRNA sensors. Furthermore, when the sgRNAs are designed to target the transcription start site of endogenous genes, this platform can be used to activate endogenous genes in a miRNA induction manner \\(Figure 1c) When dCas9 is fused with a transcriptional repressor or a base editor, we show this system can be used to repress the expression of endogenous genes or mutate specific DNA bases of chromosome depending on the expression of cell type-specific miRNAs \\(Figure 1d, e). This protocol below contains a more detailed description for the construct and application of this microRNA-inducible CRISPR-Cas9 platform."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "microRNAs \\(miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in plants, animals and viruses. However, measuring miRNA activity in vivo remains a big challenge. In this protocol, using a miRNA-mediated sgRNA releasing strategy and dCas9-VPR to drive a transgene RFP expression, we create a miRNA sensor that can faithfully measure miRNA activity at cellular levels. When sgRNAs are designed to target endogenous locus, we show this system can be adapted to achieve cell type specific activation of endogenous genes. Furthermore, when dCas9 is fused with a transcriptional repressor or a base editor, we show this system can be used to repress the expression of endogenous genes or mutate specific DNA bases of chromosome upon induction by cell type-specific miRNAs. This step-by-step protocol is related to the publication \u201cA microRNA-inducible CRISPR-Cas9 platform serves as microRNA sensors and cell type specific genome regulation tools\u201d in Nature Cell Biology.",
