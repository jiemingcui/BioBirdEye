            "content": "With high-throughput and precision, excellent reproducibility, and high sensitivity, ELISA serves a gold standard for _in vitro_ diagnostics \\(IVD) in healthcare, industry and other diversified analytical settings. In the last 50 years, over 300,000 peer-reviewed articles related to ELISA have been published, attesting its unmatched analytical performance. There are numerous advanced and improved ELISA formats for IVD, which employ improved immobilization chemistry, signal enhancement strategy, lab-on-a-chip technology, biosensing and new immunoassay formats. Regardless of the platform, the performance of such analytical platforms is dependent upon the selection of an appropriate Ab immobilization strategy<sup>1-3</sup>. To date, various immobilization schemes have been considered and tested:  physical adsorption, oriented binding, covalent binding, click chemistry, site-directed immobilization and non-covalent binding<sup>4-10</sup>. In general, such immobilization protocols involve a complex, multi-step procedure with costly reagents and additional instruments. \r\n\n\nThis protocol is a highly-simplified one-step Ab immobilization-based sandwich ELISA procedure<sup>11</sup> towards the development of rapid, cost-effective and highly-sensitive IVD kits. The dilution of capture Ab in APTES forms a stable APTES-polymer/Ab complex that is sorbed onto the MTP for the detection of HFA. HFA serves as a model analyte because all the sandwich immunoassay components are commercially-available in the form of a kit. The reduced amount of HFA is a specific biomarker for acute infectious and inflammatory diseases<sup>12</sup>. In contrast, an elevated level of HFA correlates with adiposity<sup>13</sup>, metabolic disease<sup>14</sup>, cardiovascular dysfunction<sup>15</sup>, atherosclerosis \\(related to vascular calcification with increased vascular stiffness)<sup>16</sup>, diabetes<sup>17</sup>, metabolic syndrome<sup>18,19</sup>, arthritis<sup>20</sup> and malaria<sup>21</sup>. The determination of HFA is also highly relevant in hepatocellular carcinoma<sup>22</sup>, breast cancer<sup>23</sup> and neurological diseases including multiple sclerosis<sup>24</sup>. The results obtained by the new immobilization format \\(NIF) were superior to the commercial conventional immobilization format \\(CIF) and our previously-developed covalent immobilization format \\(CovIF)-based ELISA procedures<sup>25</sup>. Its applicability for the detection of HFA in PBS and HFA spiked in diluted human whole blood and plasma compared favorably with the conventional and covalent crosslinking-based ELISA procedure<sup>25</sup>. Excellent storage stability of anti-HFA Ab-bound MTPs at 4\u00b0C in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4 is also demonstrated, illustrating the potential application of this novel immobilization strategy."

            "content": "The NIF shown in Figure 1 detected HFA in the range of 4.9 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> - 20 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> with linearity from 1.6 - 20 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> \\(Figure 2a). The estimated limit of detection \\(LOD) and analytical sensitivity<sup>6,25-27</sup> were 7 and 10 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Various experimental process controls were investigated to determine the efficiency of BSA blocking; non-specific interaction of BSA with HFA, biotinylated anti-HFA Ab and SA-HRP; and, non-specific interaction of capture anti-HFA Ab with biotinylated anti-HFA Ab. In general, the detection was highly specific for HFA without any interference of immunological reagents \\(Figure 2b). The intra- and inter-day variability ranged from 1.2 - 8.5 % and 2.1 - 10.2 %, respectively, with a half-effective concentration \\(EC50) of 2.6 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>. The intra- and inter-day variability was calculated from five assay repeats \\(in triplicate) on a single and five different days, respectively. \r\n\n\nA comparison of the NIF versus the commercial CIF and CovIF-based sandwich ELISAs is presented in Table 2. The NIF significantly decreased the overall assay time from 20 h to ~4 h. Its analytical sensitivity is 10 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>, i.e., 51-fold lower than the commercial CIF \\(510 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>). It also enabled 28-fold faster Ab immobilization than CIF. Moreover, it has a better LOD and analytical sensitivity in comparison to the HFA sandwich ELISA<sup>6,25</sup> based on heterobifunctional crosslinking of Ab to APTES-functionalized platforms, and surface plasmon resonance \\(SPR)-based immunoassay formats<sup>1,28</sup>. All the ELISA formats were performed under the same conditions with the same assay components to minimize experimental variability. The higher sensitivity of the NIF is mainly due to the higher Ab immobilization density via APTES-assisted physical adsorption, where APTES serves as a diluting and binding agent for anti-HFA capture Ab apart from a surface functionalization agent. \r\n\n\nThe detection of HFA spiked in diluted human whole blood and plasma \\(Figure 2c) using the NIF exhibited similar precision as the commercial kit, showing its applicability for the determination of HFA in clinical and bioanalytical settings. The NIF is the most sensitive immunoassay format in comparison to the CIF and CovIF for HFA. The stability of Ab immobilized on MTPs was excellent after two months of storage at 4 \u00baC in 0.1 M PBS \\(pH 7.4). No significant decrease in the Ab functional activity was observed after eight weeks \\(Figure 2d), evincing the leach-proof Ab immobilization. The preparation is very rapid \\(1 h for Ab immobilization and blocking), therefore, it might obviate the preparation of Ab-bound MTPs _in priori_ considering most antibodies are only good within two weeks of storage."

In this one-step antibody \\(Ab) immobilization, the capture anti-HFA Ab formed a stable complex with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane \\(APTES), via ionic and hydrophobic interactions. The complex adsorbed on a microtiter plate \\(MTP) as an ELISA platform for HFA, and exhibited linearity from 4.9 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> to 20 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, a limit of detection of 7 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> and an analytical sensitivity of 10 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>, i.e. 51-fold more sensitive than the commercial sandwich ELISA kit. The precision obtained by this procedure for the detection of HFA spiked in human whole blood and plasma was in agreement with the commercial kit. The anti-HFA Ab-bound MTPs stored at 4\u00b0C in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 displayed no significant decrease in original activities after two months.",
