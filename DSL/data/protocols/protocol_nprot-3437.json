            "content": "Interleukin 6 receptor \\(IL-6R) signalling has been suggested to play a causal role in the development of coronary heart disease \\(CHD) and outcome\\(1). It is thought to be involved in repair processes and scar tissue formation after myocardial infarction \\(2). Circulating levels of IL-6 are correlated with impaired left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in patients with myocardial infarction \\(MI) \\(3). Furthermore, IL-6R signalling plays an important role in the modulation of the inflammatory response after myocardial infarction and it is associated with adverse left ventricular remodelling in animal models\\(4-6). Finally, genetic evidence in humans derived from Mendelian randomization analyses have elucidated that IL-6R signalling seems to have a causal role in development of CHD \\(7,8). However, to further investigate the role of IL-6R signalling, it is necessary that a validated and inexpensive enzyme-linked immuno assay \\(ELISA) for sIL-6R is available."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "A highly-sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA) was developed for detecting soluble interleukin 6 receptor \\(sIL-6R) in human serum, a biomarker for inflammation. The aim was to set up, develop, and validate an inexpensive method to measure sIL-6R.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMoAb anti-H IL-6R was used as coating and recombinant human IL-6 was added in a second step followed by detection, using PoAb anti-H IL6R biotine. The optimal concentrations of MoAb anti-H IL-6R and PoAb anti-H IL6R biotine for the ELISA were tested in serial dilutions and were 2 \u03bcg/ml MoAB anti-H IL-6R PBS and 0.3 \u03bcg/ml PoAb anti-H IL6R biotine HPE buffer.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIntra- and inter-assay CV range were 4.6%, and 8.8% respectively. The developed ELISA correlated well with a commercially available kit \\(R&D Systems, Spearman correlation 0.86; p<0.001). The costs of one ELISA plate was approximately \u20ac90 compared to the current list price of \u20ac560 for the commercial kit.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn summary, we have developed and validated an inexpensive sIL-6R ELISA.",
