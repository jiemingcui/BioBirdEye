            "content": "<p>The most common cause of restorations failures is recurrent caries. Clinical trials with long\u2011term follow\u2011up demonstrated cariogenic microorganisms persist under restorations and have an important role in the development of secondary caries.<sup>(1-2)</sup> </p><p>Cavity disinfection using antibacterial agents before cavity restoration ensures to a great extent elimination of cariogenic bacteria in the residual dental tissues<sup>&nbsp;</sup>and a long term restoration success.<sup> (3) </sup>Minimal invasive dentistry aims to remove only the heavily contaminated dentine , to arrest the carious process and thus maintain pulp vitality. Chlorohexidine(CHX) was found to reduce residual bacteria after cavity excavation including Streptococcus mutans present in dentinal tubules.<sup>(4)</sup> Trials to eliminate the microbial load using cavity disinfectants with no adverse effect on the bond strength of adhesive restoration geared toward the long-term success. Chlorohexidine has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on dentin matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thus reducing the degradation of adhesive interfaces. However, the scientific literature reported conflicting results. Some in vitro studies had demonstrated decreased bond strengths with self-etch adhesive systems applied after using CHX as cavity disinfectant.<sup>(5)</sup> Negative effects of (CHX) were reported on the microtensile bond strengths as well as on microleakage.<sup>(6)] </sup>while analysis of other data demonstrated no adverse effect on dentin bonding.<sup>(7-8-9)</sup> </p><p>After a long period of the testing and reevaluation of several methods used to reduce pathogenic oral microorganisms, it can be stated that antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) can be adopted as a modality for bacterial decontamination in dentistry. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a minimally invasive technique based on a combination of a photosensitizer activated by a light source with a specific wavelength to produce singlet oxygen, which inactivates the target oral bacteria releases reactive oxygen, thus leading to the alteration or even death of the target microorganisms.<sup>(10-11)</sup> &nbsp;Because of the resistance of oral microorganisms to antibiotics and antiseptics, aPDT could be alternative to classical antibacterial therapy. <sup>(12)</sup> Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) was reported to be effective in reducing the microbial load during restorative treatment of deep carious lesions.<sup> (13-14)</sup></p><p>One of the most employed photosensitizers is Toluidine blue. <sup>(15)</sup> The tooth and restoration staining was reported after the use of toluidine blue. <sup>(16)</sup> Natural photosensitizers are needed due to their biological effects, biocompatibility, and easy clearance from the biological system.<sup>(17)</sup> Phycocyanin is one of the natural biological molecules found in Spirulina platensis as a light-harvesting pigment, which possess anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant effects.<sup>(18)</sup> Phycocyanin has many advantages, including water solubility, a non-toxic nature.<sup>(19)</sup> Therefore, using phycocyanin is a better alternative as a safe photosensitizer to be used in disinfecting cavities before restoration especially in esthetic zone. Phycocyanin did not cause any staining effect.<sup>(20-21</sup></p><p>&nbsp;The photosensitizer dye used in photodynamic therapy may affect the bonding of resin composite to dentin as its residual structural molecules may interfere during the adhesion process. &nbsp;According to the mechanism of aPDT in producing the free oxygen species, there may be an adverse result due to the interference of oxygen radicals with the bonding process and formation of resin tags at the tooth-adhesive interface. <sup>(22)</sup> </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the current in vitro study is to evaluate and compare the microshear bond strength of one step self-etch adhesive to deep coronal artificial caries affected dentin disinfected with either chlorohexidine or (aPDT); as well as the microshear bond strength of self -adhesive resin cement to radicular dentin disinfected with either chlorohexidine or (aPDT).</p><p><br></p>"
