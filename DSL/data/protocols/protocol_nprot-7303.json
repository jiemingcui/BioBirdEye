            "content": "<p><em>In vitro</em> scratch assays have been frequently employed to test the influence of bioactive substances on the processes of cell migration and proliferation<sup>3-9</sup>. These assays are carried out in multiwell plates and commonly rely on the manual introduction of a scratch in a confluent epithelial cell monolayer using a sterile pipette tip, razor blade, scraper or needle. The remaining epithelial cells will then migrate and proliferate into the scratched area until cell-cell contacts are reestablished<sup>10,11</sup>. In order to standardize and increase the throughput, significant improvements have been made to the <em>in vitro</em> wounding tools and methods, including the use of hand-guided pin or pipette tip arrays, robotically driven scratching-pin devices, chemically induced wounds, and laser ablation<sup>14,15</sup>. Furthermore, the assays have evolved from examining images acquired manually at fixed-time points to the use of automated fluorescent microscopy to monitor live cells expressing fluorescent markers<sup>10</sup>. Likewise, manual quantification of the scratched area has been substituted by the implementation of automated image segmentation algorithms that facilitate the analysis of high-throughput screenings<sup>17</sup>. Despite all these improvements, data analysis has been usually limited to the calculation of wound closure<sup>17,18</sup>, disregarding the kinetic information inherent to the healing process. In addition, effective processing and quantification of high-throughput image-based assays involve the integration of multiple image analysis and data extraction software tools that often require computer programming skills and/or purchase of a commercial license, increasing total experimental costs<sup>2</sup>. Here we present the procedure of an optimized high-throughput scratch assay using high-content microscopy and a mathematical model to quantify the kinetics of epithelial wound repair in individual wells through the calculation of biologically relevant parameters. The assay can be used for screening chemical compounds, bacterial suspensions<sup>2</sup>, and other bioactive substances for their effect on re-epithelialization kinetics. Furthermore, we developed the Kinetic Re-Epithelialization Analysis Pipeline (KREAP) that we implemented in Galaxy, thus providing an end-to-end workflow integrating different validated tools for reproducible image analysis, cell enumeration, re-epithelialization modeling, and HTML reporting<sup>19</sup>. KREAP is available for download and use as a virtual machine for both large and small-scale laboratories (<a href=\"https://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/KREAP/\" target=\"_blank\">https://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/KREAP/</a>).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Development of the protocol: Quantification of re-epithelialization kinetics</strong></p><p>In order to quantify the re-epithelialization kinetics of gingival cells (i.e. Ca9-22 cell line) exposed to different bacterial suspensions using our standardized scratch assay, we developed an automated image segmentation pipeline using CellProfiler 2.2.0 (<a href=\"http://www.cellprofiler.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cellprofiler.org/</a>) which identifies and records the location of each cell within the well over time<sup>2</sup>. Given that the number of cells moving into the scratched area over time can be represented by a sigmoidal curve, we used a modified form of the Gompertz function<sup>20</sup> to quantify the kinetics of wound repair. The modified Gompertz function consists of three biologically comprehensible parameters: lag time (\u03bb parameter, in minutes), repair rate (\u03bc<sub>m</sub> parameter, cells/minute), and maximum number of infiltrating cells at the plateau of the growth curve (A parameter, in cells). This function was fitted through the number of infiltrating cells over time by a nonlinear least squares regression using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm<sup>21</sup> to reduce the sum of the squares of the errors between the modeled and measured data points in an iterative manner. Using this approach, we were able to obtain excellent and accurate fits, characterized by goodness of fit (R<sup>2</sup>) values close to one and low root-mean-square errors (RMSE), respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental design</strong></p><p><strong>Selection of suitable cell line</strong>. For automated microscopy, it is preferable to select a cell line that grows in a single layer of cells, rather than in multilayers. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate the expression of relevant receptors (e.g. Toll-like receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor, etc.) in the candidate cell line as well as its responsiveness to chemical stimuli. Cells with a long doubling time (e.g. Caco-2 cell line) are less suitable for this set-up as they will require long periods of imaging. In addition, epithelial cell lines that form strong tight-junctions (e.g. Caco-2 cell line) may not allow the introduction of regular and reproducible scratches and for that reason are not ideal for this assay. </p><p><strong>Controls</strong>. Titration curves of the controls need to be carried out on each cell line to determine the optimal concentrations resulting in a large dynamic range between the positive and negative controls (<strong>Figure 1</strong> and <strong>Supplementary Fig. 1</strong>). A non-treated control should be included as a reference to determine whether the screened substances have a stimulating or attenuating effect on re-epithelialization kinetics. </p><p><strong>Z\u2019 factor calculation</strong>. The overall quality of each assay can be assessed by calculation of the Z\u2019 factor<sup>16</sup> defined by the means and variability of the positive and negative controls (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).  </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Limitations</strong> </p><p>The modified Gompertz function was implemented to describe positive growth curves. Therefore, if the growth curves resulting from a particular treatment does not resemble a sigmoidal curve, the modified Gompertz function cannot be used to calculate the kinetic parameters. This is often the case of treatments that lead to strong inhibitory effects on re-epithelialization where only few cells migrate into the scratched area during the timeframe of the assay. The KREAP \u201cData-Modeling\u201d tool flags the wells from which the parameter values could not be retrieved and the user can then examine the curves resulting from the measured data points over time as well as the image segmentation output (also see <a href=\"https://erasmusmcbioinformatics.github.io/KREAP/use_kreap_model_error\" target=\"_blank\">https://erasmusmcbioinformatics.github.io/KREAP/use_kreap_model_error</a>). Some treatments may induce cell death after the plateau of the growth curve has been reached, leading to a reduction in the number of infiltrating cells towards the end of the assay and lower R<sup>2</sup> values (&lt; 0.9). These adverse effects can be identified by inspection of the re-epithelialization curves generated by the KREAP tool that compares the measured and modeled data points. R<sup>2</sup> values lower than 0.9 are also flagged by KREAP to alert the user to examine the re-epithelialization curves.</p>"

Ca9-22 and HaCat cells should be grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. HO-1-N-1 cells should be cultured in DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. Always wear gloves when handling cells and work in a laminar flow cabinet. The cell culture environment should be kept clean, i.e. in absence of bacteria, molds and mycoplasma.\n2. Discard the growth culture media and wash the cells with 6 ml PBS.\n3. Discard the PBS and add 2 ml trypsin/EDTA and incubate at 37\u00baC for 3-5 minutes.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. Verify complete detachment of the cells under an inverted microscope.\n4. Add 8 ml of supplemented growth media into the flask and gently resuspend the cells by gently pipetting up and down.\n5. Take an aliquot of the cell suspension and determine the cell counts using a counting chamber. Dilute the cell suspensions in the corresponding growth media. The Ca9-22 cell suspension should be diluted to obtain 3.5 x 10\n5\ncells/ml; whereas HO-1-N-1 and HaCat cell suspensions should be diluted to obtain 3.0 x 10\n5\ncells/ml.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. The number of cells required to form an intact monolayer within the standardized timeframe depends on the cell type and thus, should be pre-determined for each cell line.\n6. Mix the cell suspension gently and add the suspension into a reagent reservoir.\n7. Using a multichannel pipette, add 100 \u00b5l of the cell suspension into each well of a 96-well plate with flat bottom (BD Falcon; recommended for imaging using the BD Pathway 855 Bioimaging System).\n8. Incubate for 16 hours in a humidified incubator at 37\u00baC with 5% CO\n2\n.\nCell starvation. TIMING 2 hours (might vary for other cell lines)\n9. Replace the growth media by 100 \u00b5l starvation media (i.e. FCS-free media) by aspiration of the culture medium without disturbing the cell monolayers. HaCat cells should be starved in keratinocyte serum-free medium (SFM). Starvation of Ca9-22 cells should be performed in FCS-free DMEM/F12, whereas HO-1-N-1 cells should be starved in FCS-free DMEM. SFM is not recommended when using Ca9-22 or HO-1-N-1 cells as it was shown to promote significant cell migration and proliferation in our setup that restricted the detection of exogenously added stimulatory compounds.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. The duration and the media used during starvation need to be optimized for each cell line. FCS deprivation should minimize cell migration and proliferation without inducing apoptosis or cell detachment.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n10. Incubate the cells (Ca9-22, HO-1-N-1 or HaCat cells) for 2 hours in a humidified incubator at 37\u00baC with 5% CO\n2\n.\nPreparation of master plate with treatment and control samples. TIMING 1.5 hours\n11. Prepare the treatments that you wish to test for their effect on re-epithelialization kinetics. An example of bacterial preparations is provided in\nFigure 2\n. Initial screenings can be performed in duplicates, but refined studies should be carried out with at least three technical replicates in two or more independent experiments.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. All treatments should be diluted in the starvation media.\n12. Prepare the positive and negative controls as indicated in\nFigure 3\n.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. Optimal concentrations of the controls should be determined by performing a titration for the target cell lines (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n) and should result in a large dynamic range between the positive and negative controls (\nFigure 1\n).\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n13. Prepare a master plate by adding 120 \u03bcl of each sample into the corresponding well.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. Exclude outer wells to avoid any possible edge-specific artifacts, e.g. due to evaporation of the medium. It is also recommended to add the samples into the wells in a randomized manner.\nFluorescent labelling with live-compatible dyes. TIMING 25 minutes\n14. Prepare a solution of starvation media with the fluorescent dyes. Add 10 \u03bcl of Hoechst 33342 working solution and optionally 100 \u03bcl of CellTracker\u2122 Red CMTPX stock solution into 5 ml starvation media to obtain a final concentration of 2 \u03bcg/ml and 2 \u03bcM, respectively.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. Nuclear labelling with Hoechst 33342 stain is crucial for accurate image segmentation and feature extraction with the automated image analysis pipeline presented in this protocol. Labelling of cellular cytoplasm with CellTracker\u2122 Red CMTPX can be performed to visualize cell boundaries. The concentrations of these dyes may need to be adjusted depending on the selected cell line. When using a different cell line, check that addition of the dyes at the desired concentration does not result in adverse effects in re-epithelialization kinetics.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n15. Add the labelling solution into a reagent reservoir and carefully aspirate the starvation media from the cells using a vacuum pump without disturbing the cell monolayer.\n16. Add 50 \u03bcl of the solution to each of the wells and incubate at 37\u00baC with 5% CO\n2\nfor 20 minutes.\nScratch assay and imaging. TIMING 5-16 hours depending on the cell line\n17. After 20 minutes of incubation with the labelling solution, perform a scratch in the cell monolayers of each well using the HTSScratcher to assure equally sized and reproducible scratches. Place the plate on the platform, slide the plate under the 96-pin array, press the array towards the bottom of the wells, and slide the array from left to right 3 times. Release pressure from the array and remove the plate from the platform.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. Rinse the array with water followed by ethanol before and after each experiment.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n18. Carefully aspirate the liquid from each well using the vacuum pump and wash the cells with 100 \u00b5l PBS. Repeat this step one more time.\n19. Aspirate the PBS out and immediately transfer 100 \u00b5l of each sample from the master plate to the corresponding wells in the assay plate using a multichannel pipette.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. Add 100-200 \u00b5l PBS in the outer wells to avoid differential evaporation of the samples.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n20. Start image acquisition. For the Ca9-22 or HO-1-N-1 cell lines, we recommend programming the microscope to acquire images every 20 minutes for a total of 5 hours. For the HaCat cell line, imaging intervals can be adjusted to 60 minutes for a total of 14-16 hours.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. The duration of the assay may vary depending on the cell line and can be determined by the time required for the positive control to achieve wound closure.\nImage and data analysis. TIMING 45 minutes\n21. For first time users, download the virtual machine (VM) containing the Kinetic Re-Epithelialization Analysis Pipeline (KREAP) toolbox as well as the VM player for your operating system via\nhttps://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/KREAP/\n. Import the VM into the player following the step-by-step instructions provided in the manual on the website.\n22.

Indications on how to create these files are provided at\nhttps://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/KREAP/file_formats\n.\n23. Upload the compressed folder and index file into the Galaxy history via the \u201cGet data\u201d tool.\nCRITICAL STEP\n. Set the compressed folder\u2019s type to .zip in the upload menu.\n24.

As an example, we employed this protocol to analyze the influence of <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> GG (LGG) and <em>Porphyromonas gingivalis</em> (W83) on re-epithelialization of gingival cells. Ca9-22 cells were exposed to three dosages (MOI 5, 50 and 500) of these bacteria and the re-epithelialization kinetics were determined using the KREAP toolbox. Addition of LGG at the intermediate dosage tested led to an increased repair rate (P = 0.03) (<strong>Figure 6a</strong>) and a significantly higher number of cells inside the scratched area as compared to the non-treated control (<strong>Figure 6b, c</strong>). However, higher dosages of LGG resulted in reduced re-epithelialization. This could be attributed to the acidification of the media (down to pH 5) by LGG fermentation products, leading to cell death and suppressed wound closure, which was clearly reflected by the modeled A parameter (i.e. maximum number of cells) (<strong>Figure 6b</strong>). In contrast, we obtained a clear negative dosage effect upon exposure of gingival cells to increasing dosages of <em>P. gingivalis</em> (<strong>Figure 6a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>). At the higher dosage tested, <em>P. gingivalis</em> led to reduced migration of cells into the scratched area, resulting in a significantly lower number of infiltrated cells (P &lt; 0.001) as illustrated by the A parameter (<strong>Figure 6b, c</strong>). Nonetheless, we also showed that the repair rate (\u03bc<sub>m</sub>) was not significantly influenced by any of the <em>P. gingivalis</em> preparations (<strong>Figure 6a</strong>). After introduction of the scratch in the cell monolayer, the cells were not immediately affected by the presence of <em>P. gingivalis </em>(MOI 500) and started to migrate into the scratched area in an attempt to restore cell-cell contacts. However, during the course of the experiment migration of cells into the scratched area eventually ceased, resulting in an unresolved wound (<strong>Figure 6c</strong>) and a low A parameter value. </p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p><em>In vitro</em> scratch assays provide an attractive method to study the regulation and mechanisms of epithelial cell proliferation and migration that are involved in wound repair. The assay is performed by introducing a scratch into a confluent cell monolayer and monitoring the re-epithelialization of the \u201cwound\u201d by acquiring images over time. Despite improvements to the method over the past years, high-throughput screenings often require the integration of multiple image analysis and data extraction software tools. We developed a high-throughput image-based scratch assay and an automated processing pipeline that employs a mathematical model to describe re-epithelialization kinetics. We implemented a processing pipeline in Galaxy called KREAP that provides an open source web-based platform to enable scientists from diverse backgrounds to perform reproducible and quantitative repair data analyses in less than 45 minutes.</p>",
