            "content": "Positional cloning is a powerful approach to identify genes mutated in human and animal models monogenic diseases, and is the option of choice when there is no functional candidate genes that appear as good candidates based on their known biochemical functions. The genomic DNA region \\(and the embedded polymorphisms) harbouring the disease-causing mutations segregates with the disease in analyzed pedigrees. However, positional cloning relayed until recently on the availability of large pedigrees to reach a significant linkage. \r\n\n\nThis protocol describes the use of whole genome genotyping on sporadic consanguineous patients to identify potential disease loci and subsequent positional candidate genes, by homozygosity mapping \\(Autozygosity). It takes advantage of  high density single nucleotide polymorphism \\(SNP) genotyping arrays, and of the assumption that unrelated patients from several consanguineous families are mutated in the same gene. It was applied to the mapping of a novel gene involved in autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy, amphiphysin 2/BIN1 \\(ref. 1)."

On ice, prepare a mix containing 1.25 \u00b5l Xba adaptators, 2.5 \u00b5l ligase buffer \\(10X), and 1.25 \u00b5l T4 DNA Ligase.

Check the complexity of the amplified DNA fragments by loading 3 \u00b5l of each PCR on a 2% agarose/TAE 1X gel : there should be a DNA ladder centered around 1-2 Kb.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Pool the 4 PCR reactions per DNA samples and purify on a filtration plate applying ~800 mbar \\(vacuum Pump). Wash three times with 50 \u00b5l sterile water, then resuspend the DNA with 45 \u00b5l EB elution buffer by shaking moderately for 5 min using a minishaker for 96 well plates.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**DNA fragmentation**\r\n\n\n8.

Arrays hybridization, washing, and scanning are performed on a dedicated Affymetrix microarray platform following standardized procedures.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Data analysis**\r\n\n\n12. To determine homozygous regions, results from the Affymetrix platform are analyzed with the GDAS 3.0 software. SNP call rate should be greater than 95% and signal detection greater than 99%. Display the loss of heterozygosity \\(LOH) parameter, which ranks genomic regions based on the number of contiguous homozygous SNPs, their distance and heterozygosity rate. Higher the LOH is, stronger is the chance that the region is truly homozygous by descent and derived from the same common ancestor. For first degree consanguinity, we consider that the minimal LOH required is 4; on a 10K array, we also use regions with more than 30 SNPs in a row. Count a no call SNP as homozygous.\r\n  \r\n\n\n13. Disease-linked loci are determined by comparing the selected homozygous regions of several consanguineous patients. If patients are from the same family, analysis of unaffected siblings can rule out common homozygous regions by chance. Starting from sporadic cases from different families, we make the assumption that they are mutated in the same gene. The probability that a number of consecutive SNPs would be concordant and homozygous by chance depends on the number of patients and families and is given in ref 2. Positional candidate regions are selected if homozygous regions are common to at least three unrelated consanguineous patients.\r\n  \r\n\n\n14. Positional candidate regions are defined by the nucleotide position of the first heterozygous SNPs that frame the smallest common homozygous region. Copy-paste these coordinates in a human genome web browser \\(for example \"http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway\":http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) to display the list of positional candidate genes that remain to be analysed in search of sequence variants."

For the second approach, we followed the described procedure to define a common homozygous region on chromosome 2 in three sporadic consanguineous patients from unrelated families : at 2q14, patient AAT68 had 66 homozygous SNPs for a LOH of 12.3; patient ADR71 94 SNPs, LOH=17.4; patient ABJ25 60 SNPs, LOH=11.3. The common homozygous region encompassed 66 SNPs for a length of 21 Mb. Direct sequencing of the BIN1 gene uncovered mutations in patients AAT68 and ADR71. Note that we have not found a disease-causing sequence variant in patient ABJ25 in all coding exons of the gene and that, through the functional candidate approach, we found a homozygous mutation in a forth unrelated patient that was not obviously linked to this region \\(9 homozygous SNPs around the BIN1 gene, LOH=1.2). All analyzed patients were from first degree consanguinity and displayed several large homozygous regions."
