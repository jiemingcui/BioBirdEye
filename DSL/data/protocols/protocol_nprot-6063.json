            "content": "Both MS and EAE are characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells, including T cells, B cells, macrophages and DCs and demyelination of axonal tracks in the central nervous system.<sup>1</sup> EAE can be initiated by 1. active induction: immunization with myelin antigens in adjuvant<sup>2</sup> or 2. passive induction: adoptive transfer of myelin-specific T cells.<sup>3</sup> Both methods depend on the same fundamental principles. Beside T cells, evidences from clinical researches and basic experimental models indicate that DCs are involved in the pathogenesis of most autoimmune diseases.<sup>4</sup> In addition, among the antigen-presenting cells \\(APCs), DCs alone are sufficient to prime myelin-reactive T cells to induce EAE.<sup>5</sup> Therefore, due to plasticity of DCs, agents that alter the DC differentiation from activation to tolerance, have been emerged and applied on the clinical trials.<sup>6-8</sup> This results TolDCs to become a potential therapy in the clinical treatment of autoimmune disorders.<sup>9-11</sup> \r\n\n\nIn order to test the function of agents in inducing TolDC phenotype, the protocol has been established to show the passive induction of EAE by adoptive transfer of DCs primed with myelin antigen into na\u00efve mice. Hematopoietic stem cells \\(HSCs) were isolated from mice bone marrow and cultured with differentiation factors to generate bone marrow-derived DCs \\(BMDCs). BMDCs were treated with LPS for activation before received agents \\(CDDO-DFPA in our publication) for tolerogenic phenotypes or PBS. BMDCs were subcutaneously injected into C57BL/6 mice once each week for four consecutive weeks. Mice were monitored daily symptoms of EAE, using standard criteria \\(**Figure 1**).<sup>12</sup>"

Fresh medium with 15 ng/ml of GM-CSF and 10 ng/ml of IL-4 were added to cultures on day 0, 3, and 5. BMDCs were harvested on day 7 and analyzed by flow cytometry for CD11c expression \\(70-80% of the expanded cell population, **Figure 2**). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Preparation of mature or tolerogenic DCs**\r\n\n\nBMDCs were harvested on day 7 and pre-treated with the absence or presence of CDDO-DFPA \\(400 nM) for 4 hours before LPS \\(100 n\uf06dg/ml) treatment for 24 hours. BMDCs were then treated with MOG \\(35-55) \\(100 \u03bcg/ml) for 4 hours prior to the administration.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Induction and evaluation of EAE**\r\n\n\nEAE was induced in 8-10 week old female C57BL/6 mice. Methods for passive induction of EAE by ex vivo expanded BMDCs were adopted from previously described protocol.\n14\nIn brief, mice received 2\u00d710\n6\nLPS-stimulated, MOG-pulsed CD11c+ BMDCs at a total volume of 200\u2009\u03bc\uf06dL injected subcutaneously \\(100\u03bc\u2009\uf06dL into each hind leg). On the day of BMDC transfer and 48 hours later, each mouse also received 200 ng of pertussis toxin \\(PTX), and DCs were injected into C57BL/6 mice once each week for four consecutive weeks. Mice were monitored daily for survival and symptoms of EAE, using standard criteria \\(**Video 1**).\n12"

Induction of EAE results infiltration of T cells and demyelination of axon in central nervous system, further leading the clinical symptoms of MS. Beside T cells, dendritic cells \\(DCs) is a key importance for initiation of EAE through their antigen presentation ability. Because of the plasticity of DCs, agents \\(CDDO-DFPA in our lab) that repress activated DCs confer a tolerogenic DC \\(TolDC) phenotype. TolDCs have emerged as clinical targets for the treatment of autoimmunity. This protocol describes a method for passive induction of EAE by adoptive transfer of DCs primed with myelin antigen into na\u00efve mice. We have shown the ability of inducing EAE between activated DCs and TolDCs in associated publication \u201cA unique tolerizing dendritic cell phenotype induced by the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO-DFPA \\(RTA-408) is protective against EAE\u201d in _Scientific report._",
