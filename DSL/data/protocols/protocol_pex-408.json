The presence of a vaginal plug is considered embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the Distal-visceral-endoderm (E5.5), Anterior-visceral-endoderm (E6.0), Early-Streak (E6.5), late Mid-Streak (E7.0) and No-bud (E7.5) stages, kill the pregnant mouse with cervical dislocation according to animal ethics guidelines.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carefully dissect mouse decidua from the uterus under a dissecting microscope, and wash embryos in a 6-cm petri dish containing RNase-free PBS on ice.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer the decidua into a cryomold and add precooled OCT compound. Gently move the tissues down to near the bottom of the cryomold and put them in the vertical position.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immediately freeze the embryo in dry ice, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for several weeks.\nPre-gastrulation stages (E5.5 and E6.0) samples collection\nAt E5.5, the epiblast forms a cup-shaped pseudostratified columnar epithelium that surrounds the visceral endoderm (VE), and the visceral endoderm becomes polarized in the proximal\u2013distal dimension. The cells located at the distal tip of the egg cylinder (distal visceral endoderm, DVE) shift anteriorly (anterior visceral endoderm, AVE) as the embryo develops (E5.5-E6.0). These cells are tall columnar in morphology, unlike the squamous visceral endoderm cells overlaying the epiblast but outside the DVE/AVE domain[1]. At E5.75, AVE is located on one side of the shorter axis of the cross section of the cylinder opposite from the site of primitive streak formation. The prospective anterior\u2013posterior embryonic axis from the short axis to the long axis of the ellipsoidal cross section of the egg cylinder between E6.0\u2013E6.5. Therefore, we respectively collected two sectors of epiblast (Epi1/Epi2) and visceral endoderm (En1/En2) along with long axis of the ellipsoidal cross section at E5.5 stage, and divide epiblast and VE into anterior sectors (A/EA) and posterior sectors (P/EP) respectively along with long axis of the ellipsoidal cross section at E6.0 stage. Considering the cell number of sectors, we increase thickness from 15 \u03bcm to 30 \u03bcm at E5.5 stage for collecting two part of epiblast or VE.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clean the cryostat and set the temperature on the cryostat to \u221220 \u00b0C. Open UVC disinfection for 30min.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove the frozen block of OCT compound from the cryomold, and affix it to a metal stage at the OCT for cryosectioning.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Set the cutting thickness of E5.5 embryo is 15 \u03bcm or 30 \u03bcm, and transfer serial sections of embryo onto LCM PEN membrane slides. However, set the cutting thickness of E6.0 embryo is 15 \u03bcm, and transfer alternate sections of embryo onto LCM PEN membrane slides. Therefore, harvest 6 sections (15 \u03bcm/section, serial sections) or 3 sections (30 \u03bcm/section, serial sections) of E5.5 embryos, and 5 sections (15 \u03bcm/section, alternate sections ) of E6.0 embryos.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place the membrane slides with cryosections in 100% (vol/vol), 95% (vol/vol) and 70% (vol/vol) ethanol solution for 30 s each.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stain with 1% (wt/vol) cresyl violet in 70% (vol/vol) ethanol for 30 s.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dehydrate the slides in 70%, 95% and 100% (vol/vol) ethanol for 30 s each.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After slides dry, make a sandwich by putting a cover-glass slide under the stained membrane slide.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choose the different cell populations as defined by both position and morphology. Epiblast are pseudostratified columnar epitheliums and endoderm are squamous epithelial cells in outer layer. The sampling strategy was modified in accordance to the size of the section. In the epiblast/ectoderm, sampling was collected for two sectors (Epi1/Epi2) of E5.5 embryos and only from A (anterior) and P (posterior) sectors of E6.0 embryos. From the endoderm, only two sectors (Epi1/Epi2) of E5.5 embryos and only A and P samples of E6.0 embryos were collected.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cut target cells, and collect them with IsolationCaps.\nGastrulation stages (E6.5, E7.0 and E7.5) samples collection\nAt E6.5, the primitive streak appears as a local morphological discontinuity in the posterior epiblast epithelium. At the primitive streak, the epiblast cells undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, then ingress in-between the epiblast and endoderm to become incorporated into either the mesoderm. Therefore, mouse embryo develops \u2018inside-out\u2019 pattern, with the internally-located ectoderm surrounded by the mesoderm and endoderm.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clean the cryostat and set the temperature on the cryostat to \u221220 \u00b0C. Open UVC disinfection for 30min.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove the frozen block of OCT compound from the cryomold, and affix it to a metal stage at the OCT for cryosectioning.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Set the cutting thickness of E6.5 and E7.0 embryos are 15 \u03bcm, whereas cutting thickness of E7.5 embryos is 20 \u03bcm. Transfer alternate sections of embryo onto LCM PEN membrane slides.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place the membrane slides with cryosections in 100% (vol/vol), 95% (vol/vol) and 70% (vol/vol) ethanol solution for 30 s each.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stain with 1% (wt/vol) cresyl violet in 70% (vol/vol) ethanol for 30 s.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dehydrate the slides in 70%, 95% and 100% (vol/vol) ethanol for 30 s each.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After slides dry, make a sandwich by putting a cover-glass slide under the stained membrane slide.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choose the different cell populations as defined by both position and morphology. Epiblast are pseudostratified columnar epitheliums on the inside of the embryo, and endoderm are squamous epithelial cells in outer layer with the mesoderm in the middle. The sampling strategy was modified in accordance to the size of the section. In the epiblast/ectoderm, sampling was collected for A (anterior) and P (posterior) sectors of E6.5 embryos, and lateral sectors (left lateral and right lateral) were captured in E7.0 and E7.5 embryo. From the endoderm and mesoderm, only A and P samples were collected.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cut target cells, and collect them with IsolationCaps.\nAutomated platform-based cDNA library construction (Auto-seq)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RNA extraction, reverse transcription and cDNA preamplification were followed Geo-seq protocol[2].\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 25 \u00b5l ddH2O into 15 \u00b5l PCR product, transfer 40 \u00b5l mixture into 96-well PCR Plates as the Source Plates.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equilibrate AMPure XP beads to room temperature, and then vortex thoroughly for several seconds.

However, a comprehensive genome-wide molecular annotation of the mechanism that determines the lineage specification and cell fate decision has not been clarified. Here, we combined laser microdissection-based spatial transcriptome analysis (Geo-seq) and automated platform-based low-input RNA sequencing (Auto-seq), and generated a series of spatial transcriptome dataset that encompass mouse embryos from pre-gastrulation (E5.5) to late gastrulation (E7.5) on all germ layers in the embryo proper.&nbsp;</p>",
