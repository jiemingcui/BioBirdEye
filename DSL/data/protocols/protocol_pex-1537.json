Therefore, retaining all the residues within the H-bond constrained structure is crucial for mimicking molecular recognition in small peptidomimetics.</p><p>In the absence of their native protein paraphernalia, short-excised segments of peptide turns adopt random coil structures and seldom their turn conformations. Hence a variety of strategies have been employed in synthetic peptidomimetics of these turns. Azabicycloalkane amino acids<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>25</sup></a>, spiro-bicyclic molecules<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>26</sup></a>, triazolo-\u03b2-aza-\u03b5-amino acids<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>27</sup></a> and sugar amino acids<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>28</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>29</sup></a>, have been used as surrogates for the i+1, i+2 residues in the 10-membered ring hydrogen-bonded \u03b2-turns. Macrocyclizations through side-chain olefin metathesis<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>30</sup></a> and other covalent bridges<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>31-35</sup></a>, have also been incorporated to mimic \u03b2-turns and the related 3<sub>10</sub>-helices. Similar side-chain staples like disulfide<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>36</sup></a>, lactam<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>37</sup></a>, olefin<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>38</sup></a>, diazine<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>39</sup></a>, and non-covalent interactions<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>40-42</sup></a> have been efficient for \u03b1-helical turn mimicry.</p><p>The hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) strategy, where the putative i+4\u00e0i peptide hydrogen bond is replaced by a covalent surrogate, was employed initially by Satterthwait and co-workers<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>43</sup></a> and then by Arora and co-workers<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>44</sup></a>. The former used a hydrazone surrogate while the latter used olefin, alkane, thioether and disulfide surrogates. The olefin model has been most successful among these in mimicking the \u03b1-helix<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>44</sup></a> and the \u03c0-helical turn<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>45</sup></a>. In these models, the i+1<sup>st</sup> residue of the turn is also replaced, apart from the hydrogen bond. Broussy and co-workers<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>46</sup></a>, Alewood and co-workers<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>47</sup></a> and Prabhakaran and co-workers<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>48</sup></a> developed the propane, substituted-propane and an additional exocyclic sp\u00b2 hybridization of i+1<sup>st</sup> residue nitrogen respectively, as HBS models. Here, exclusively the hydrogen bond is replaced by the HBS model and all residues in the HBS-constrained turn are retained. The sp\u00b2-constrained HBS model, termed the 13<sub>7</sub>3 model<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>48</sup></a>, has yielded the highest known \u03b1-helicities for single turns in tetrapeptides<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>48</sup></a>. It has been used to decipher the presence of a synergetic guidance mechanism for ultra-fast helix growth during helix folding<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>49</sup></a>, following the relatively slow helix nucleation step<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>50</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>51</sup></a>. It is the only HBS model to mimic the 3<sub>10</sub>-helical turn<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>52</sup></a>. Moreover, we have also shown that our HBS model has also been applied in studying dynamic \u03b2-sheet structures<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>53</sup></a>. Thus, this HBS model is a generic replacement for H-bonds in a variety of turns (Figure 1).</p><p>This protocol details the procedures for the large-scale solution-phase synthesis of \u03b2-turn, 3<sub>10</sub>-helical, \u03b1-helical and larger turn peptidomimetics constrained by the generic propyl HBS model, containing the exocyclic sp\u00b2 hybridization. Two Fukuyama-Mitsunobu reactions<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>54</sup></a> place all elements of the HBS between any two desired residues, with great facility and in high yields. Two salting-out processes isolate two crucial intermediates from triphenylphosphine (PPh<sub>3</sub>) and triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) in high purity, without column chromatography. A macrolactamization process yields solution-phase synthetic access to any HBS-constrained turn structure. This follows our recent demonstration of a trimodular synthetic protocol for the large (&gt;100 mmoles) scale access to single turn \u03b1-helices and their extended structures, in the laboratory<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>55</sup></a>. Current protocol gives facile, generic, large-scale access to a variety of HBS turns, while retaining all residues in the turns.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental design-</strong></p><p>Our protocol has been demonstrated to replace the i+n\u00e0i H-bonding interaction closing ordered turns, where n=2, 3, 4, but is potentially applicable for any value of n. These HBS turns employ inexpensive standard synthons and protected amino acids used for the solution-phase synthesis of peptides. Any HBS turn is divided into two modules, which are synthesized independently and coupled together. The first module is common to all turns and has the propyl HBS linker connecting the nitrogens of two amino esters \u2013 one N-Boc and CO2Me protected and the other N-Moc and CO2Bn protected (<strong>7</strong>) (Figure 2). Each of the two N-alkylations is efficiently enabled through a Fukuyama-Mitsunobu (FM) reaction on N-<em>o</em>-nitrosulphonyl (Ns) amino esters (1 eq.) in the presence of diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD, 1.5 eq.), triphenylphosphine (PPh3, 1.5 eq.) and alcohol (2 eq.), in tetrahydrofuran (THF); followed by denosylation in the presence of benzene thiol (PhSH, 1.1 - 1.5 eq) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3, 2.0 eq.) in acetonitrile (ACN); then acidification with 1N HCl; followed by washing of the PPh3 and triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) with diethyl ether (DEE) to get the ammonium chloride salt in high purity (HPLC); followed by protection of the amines as N-Boc (<strong>4</strong>) (first amine) and N-Moc (<strong>7</strong>) (the second). The ether wash is a salient feature that precludes cumbersome repetitive column chromatographic purifications which are otherwise essential after every FM reaction, to remove PPh3 and TPPO. The second module is a simple N-Cbz-protected peptide carboxylic acid-containing n-1 residues, with base-tolerant, acid-sensitive, but not hydrogenation-sensitive side-chain protecting groups. Synthesis of both these modules have been demonstrated in &gt;100 mmole scale in our standard academic laboratory and is amenable to much larger industrial scales.</p><p>Boc deprotection of the HBS linked first module (<strong>7</strong>) in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane (DCM), followed by peptide coupling with C-terminus of the second module in the presence of ethyl chloroformate (ECF, 1.1 eq.) N-methyl morpholine (NMM, 4.0 eq.) in THF to get the precursor for the macrolactamization (<strong>9</strong>), followed by reductive double deprotection of N-Cbz and O-Bn groups in the presence of 1% Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH), followed by macrolactamization cyclization of the resulting amino acid (<strong>10</strong>) in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), 1-hydroxy benzotriazole (HOBT), diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in 1 mM ACN, yields the desired HBS turn (<strong>11</strong>) in good yields (30-65%) depending on the ring size and sequence. Cyclization scales are limited only by the size of vessel available for 1 mM concentrations. Thus, a combinatorial library of HBS turns can be prepared from a variety of the two modules.</p><p>A C-terminal exocyclic methyl ester group (-CO2Me) is presented in all these HBS turns (<strong>10</strong>), for extension of sequence beyond the HBS turn, through methyl ester deprotection in the presence of LiOH in MeOH:H2O, followed by acidification with 1 N HCl and coupling with the desired peptide. The C-terminal extension peptide can be synthesized independently and its coupling with the HBS turns can be achieved in either solution or solid phase. The N-Moc protecting group remarkably remains unperturbed under standard (acidic, basic and hydrogenation) deprotection conditions but can be cleaved in 40% HBr in acetic acid. The conditions, reagents and their quantities in each step are optimized for fast, cheap, large-scale synthesis and facile isolation of the desired intermediates and products and to eliminate competing undesired byproduct formation. Together, isolated HBS turns and C-terminal extended HBS turns are both accessed with high efficiency and functional group tolerance through this trimodular synthetic protocol.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Applications of the method</strong></p><p>Current HBS design is such that all native residues within H-bond closed turns, and hence their molecular recognition elements, are uniquely retained in the HBS turn analogues. The presence of sp2 hybridization at N-Moc nitrogen, in addition to two sp2 hybridized atoms presented per peptide bond in the constrained turn sequence, provides sufficient Thorpe-Ingold effect for efficient cyclization of even 16-membered rings. HBS turns containing unnatural and sterically hindered residues (D-amino acid, Aib = \u03b1-aminoisobutyric acid) and tertiary amide bonds (proline), have also been synthesized with high efficiency, which shows potential for accessing even larger HBS turns. Delineation of the HBS turn from the C-terminal extension sequence during synthesis allows combinatorial access to variants of both HBS turn and their extended analogues. The highest known thermal and chemical stabilities and ellipticities have been achieved for a variety of these HBS turns<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">48</a>, <a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">52</a>, <a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">55</a>. Both these are important features with applications during the identification of drug leads.</p>"

Take 3.35 g of Cbz-S(tBu)-OH (11.35 mmol, 1.2 eq.) in oven-dried 100 ml RBF containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar.\n2. Seal with rubber septum and wrap with parafilm. Evacuate it by high vacuum using an oil pump for 2 min via an inlet needle (0.8 x 25 mm).\n3. Backfill the flask with N\n2\nballoon through a needle (0.8 x 25 mm).\n4. Add 23 ml dry THF via 50 ml syringe equipped with aspiration needle (20 Gaze x 12 Inch).\n\u2206 CRITICAL STEP\nThe dry THF should be freshly prepared. We found that the reaction is moisture sensitive, so dryness should be maintained. Keep the N\n2\nballoon connected to the RBF through a needle (0.8 x 25 mm).\n5. Stir the reaction mixture at -15\no\nC for the next 1:30 h.\n\u2206 CRITICAL STEP\nWe strongly recommend that the temperature should be maintained at -15\no\nC because it stabilizes the\nin situ\ngenerated mixed anhydride.\n6. Subsequently, seal the RBF with rubber septum and wrap with parafilm of H\n2\nN-N(Trt)-OMe and repeat step 2 and 3 twice. Make a solution by addition of 10 ml of dry THF via syringe equipped with aspiration needle (20 Gaze x 12 Inch).\n7. In the solution of Cbz-S(tBu)-OH, add 1.55 ml of N-Methylmorpholine (NMM) (14.2 mmol, 1.5 eq.) in a disposable syringe equipped with a stainless-steel needle (0.55 x 25 mm) while stirring the reaction mixture at -15\no\nC.\n8. Next add 0.95 ml of ethyl chloroformate (ECF) (9.9 mmol, 1.05 eq.) in a disposable syringe equipped with a stainless-steel needle (0.55 x 25 mm). The reaction mixture turns clear to turbid.\n9. After 4-5 mins, transfer the solution of H\n2\nN-N(Trt)-OMe using syringe equipped with aspiration needle (20 Gaze x 12 Inch) to the RBF containing Cbz-S(tBu)-OH solution.\n10. Immediately add 2.6 ml of NMM (23.6 mmol, 2.5 eq.) in a disposable syringe equipped with a stainless-steel needle (0.55 x 25 mm) over a period of 30 sec. Let the reaction mixture stir at -15\no\nC for 1.5 h.\n\u2206 CRITICAL STEP\nWe advise the checking of TLC (50% vol/vol ethyl acetate : pet. Ether (Petroleum ether)) for the full consumption of acid in the form of corresponding ester. The formation of mixed anhydride is very fast and generally, it takes 3 \u2013 4 min.\n\u2206 CRITICAL STEP\nThe addition of NMM is exothermic in nature. Maintain the temperature throughout the reaction course at -15\no\nC. We recommend monitor the reaction progress by TLC (70% vol/vol ethyl acetate : pet. ether) and HRMS.\nR\nf\nof Cbz-S(tBu)N(Trt)-OMe = 0.4 in EtOAc/pet. ether (70% (vol/vol)),\nR\nf\nof Cbz-S(tBu)-OH = 0.0 in EtOAc/pet. ether (70% (vol/vol)). For HRMS, take 1mg of the crude product in 1.5 ml Eppendorf vial and submit for mass spectrum. Reaction is complete when TLC and HRMS show no traces of Cbz-S(tBu)-OH.\n11. Do the qualitative estimation of the starting material and the product during the reaction by performing steps\nA\n,\nB, C\n(mentioned in\nBOX3\n).\n12. Quench the reaction by the addition of few drops of double-distilled water, the solution turns from turbid to clear.\n13. Remove the THF by rotary evaporator under a low-pressure gradient (400 \u2013 800 mbar) and with water bath temperature set at 48\no\nC.\n14. Next transfer the reaction mixture after dissolving in 20-30 ml ethylacetate (EtOAc) in 100 ml separatory funnel and add 1N HCl (20 ml) slowly (10ml / 30 sec). Seal the separatory funnel with polyethylene cap, shake the reaction mixture and let the contents settle down for 2 min until two layers separated out. If there is no clear separation, then add more EtOAc until there is (~10 ml) clear separation.\n15. separate the aqueous layer and add saturated sodium bicarbonate (10 ml) to the organic layer. Seal the separatory funnel again with polyethylene cap, shake the reaction mixture and settle down for 2 min until two layers are separated out.\n16. separate the aqueous layer and pass the organic layer through the crystalline sodium sulphate to remove the residual amount of water and collect in 100 ml one neck RBF.\n17. Repeat step 14 - 16 twice with EtOAc (2 x 15 ml) and discard the aqueous layer.\n\u2206\nCRITICAL STEP\nIt is essential to remove all the NMM.HCl salt and unreacted NMM, otherwise it interferes with the compound during the column. saturated sodium bicarbonate removes the unreacted Cbz-S(tBu)-N(Trt)-OH.\n! CAUTION\nThe HCl fume is very corrosive and irritates eyes and throats. Carry out this step inside fume hood.\n18. Remove the organic portion in rotary evaporator to obtain a transparent liquid compound, set the water bath temperature to 45\no\nC and vacuum pressure gradient 400 \u2013 800 mbar.\n19. Dissolve the residue in minimum amount of DCM (2 ml) and add 5 g silica gel (100 \u2013 200 mesh). Remove the DCM under high vacuum (100 mbar) to obtain dry slurry.\n20. Pack the chromatography column (\nL\n\u2013 400 mm,\nD\n- 30 mm) with dry silica gel (100 \u2013 200 mesh).\n21. Directly transfer the dry slurry to the column using a plastic funnel (\nD\n- 55 mm).\n22. Elute the desired product using EtOAc/ pet. ether 50% vol/vol) by gravity column (rate \u2013 400 ml/1h) (Table 1).\n23. Collect the fraction in 25 x 150 mm test tubes. Using the TLC, identify the fractions containing the desired product and visualize it with UV lamp (254 nm).\n24. Combine the fractions containing the desired product in 500 ml RBF and remove the solvent by rotary evaporator, set the water bath temperature to 48\no\nC. Dry the compound using oil vacuum pump (10 mbar) to obtain a white solid compound in 65% yield (4.0 g).\n\u25a1 PAUSE POINT\nThis compound (Cbz-S(tBu)N(Trt)-OMe) is bench stable at room temperature for several months without appearance of any noticeable impurity on TLC.\nBOX 2. Synthesis of Module 3 [Boc-A-R(Z\n2\n)-Ipr] \u2022 TIMING 14 h\nProcedure (Figure 4)\n1.\nSeal the RBF containing 0.96 g of TFA-R(Z\n2\n)-Ipr (1.6 mmol, 1 eq.) with rubber septum and wrap with parafilm. Evacuate it by high vacuum using an oil pump for 5 min via an inlet needle (0.8 x 25 mm).\n2. Backfill the flask with N\n2\nballoon through a needle (0.8 x 25 mm). Repeat steps 1 and 2 twice.\n3. Add 6 ml dry THF via 20 ml syringe equipped with aspiration needle (20 Gaze x 12 Inch).\n\u2206 CRITICAL STEP\nThe dry THF should be freshly prepared.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Short Turn and Helix mimics frequently represent molecular recognition surfaces perturbing bio-relevant protein-biomolecular interfaces. Generic methods that can stabilize short peptides into turns or helices by retaining all recognition elements, have tremendous applications in drug discovery. Here, a versatile modular synthetic protocol is presented for stabilizing turns and helices of different sizes by replacing their ring-closing hydrogen bonds with a generic three-carbon covalent surrogate. Two Fukuyama-Mitsunobu reactions insert the surrogate between desired residues in high yields and purity. Coupling with turn size-dependent oligopeptides containing both sterically restricted and non-coded residues, followed by macrolactamization yield a variety of stabilized turns. Short peptide extensions at the C-terminus of these turns yield stabilized 3<sub>10</sub>-helices and \u03b1-helices. This solution-phase synthetic approach provides combinatorial access to libraries of stabilized turns and helices with all their native residues retained, in &gt;100 mmole scales, in about one week per stabilized mimic, to technicians with postgraduate level training.</p>",
