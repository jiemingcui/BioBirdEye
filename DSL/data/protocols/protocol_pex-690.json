            "content": "<p>Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are used clinically for the treatment of lymphoma and are under development for treatment of multiple other types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.<sup>1 </sup>Inhibitor potency and overall biological effect are often determined by the duration of the inhibitor\u2013enzyme binding event.<sup>2-4 </sup>In fact, approved anti-cancer drugs such as panobinostat, chidamide, and romidepsin are potent HDAC inhibitors that display extended enzyme residence time.<sup>5-7 </sup>However, standard HDAC assays disregard the dynamic character of the inhibitor\u2013enzyme interaction and do not provide kinetic information.<sup>8 </sup>Here, we describe a robust and uncomplicated high-throughput&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>assay for HDAC inhibitor kinetic profiling. This assay helped identify previously unreported non-covalent irreversible properties of known HDAC inhibitors.<sup>6,7 </sup>Moreover, this assay format has also been adapted for the kinetic characterization of both inhibitors and substrates of the sirtuins,<sup>9,10 </sup>which are class III HDACs involved in metabolic control and oncogene regulation.<sup>11</sup></p><p>To characterize inhibition and evaluate potential time-dependent changes in inhibition, deacylase enzyme activity is recorded in a continuous manner with the use of&nbsp;peptide substrates containing a C-terminal \u03b5-<em>N</em>-acyllysine residue coupled to the 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) fluorophore.<sup>12 </sup>Substrate, enzyme, trypsin and inhibitor (and NAD<sup>+</sup>co-substrate for sirtuins) are incubated for a set amount of time. During that period, the substrate becomes deacylated in relation to the residual activity of the enzyme, thereby presenting a free C-terminal lysine residue. Trypsin recognizes the non-acylated lysine residue and cleaves the C-terminal amide bond to release AMC. The fluorescence of AMC dramatically increase upon release, and light emission is used to quantify substrate converted over time. Measuring deacylase inhibition in a continuous manner requires instant fluorophore release. This is achieved with a small but sufficient amount of trypsin, which processes deacylated substrate without compromising enzyme activity.&nbsp;Assay progression curves upon addition of an inhibitor permit determination of kinetic constants of binding and release, enzyme residence time, and overall inhibitor potency.<sup>6,13</sup></p>"

            "content": "Experiments are performed in 96-well half-area plates, containing 50 \u00b5L final assay volume. Inhibitor dilutions are performed in transparent conical bottom plates prior to transfer to assay plates, while substrate and enzyme stock solutions are prepared in plastic microcentrifuge tubes. All compound stocks solutions and dilution series are prepared in assay buffer from concentrated DMSO solutions, so that final DMSO assay concentration does not exceed 1%. For continuous assays, substrate, NAD\n+\nco-substrate (for sirtuin assays), inhibitor, and trypsin are added to the assay plate, followed by addition of enzyme and immediate readout at room temperature every 30 s until the assay is completed. All experiments are performed as internal duplicates, and control wells without inhibitor and without enzyme or inhibitor (background) are included.\nDetermination of continuous assay conditions:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a set concentration of substrate higher than the\nK\nM\n(ideally 3 times higher, use 200 \u00b5M substrate concentration if\nK\nM\nunknown), perform time course experiments at varying enzyme and trypsin concentration until linear progression curves are obtained with appropriate signal-to-noise ratio (optimally, rates of 3\u20135% of the uninhibited reaction should be discernable from baseline). Fine-tune enzyme concentration if necessary.\nExample: incubate enzyme at 1000, 100, 10 and 1 nM concentration with trypsin (16, 8, 4 and 2 \u00b5g/mL), substrate (200 \u00b5M), and NAD\n+\n(500 \u00b5M; only for sirtuins) for 60 min with fluorescence reads every 30 s.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the preferred concentration of enzyme, screen concentrations of trypsin to find the lowest possible concentration at which the conversion rate is kept as high as possible. This ensures that AMC release by trypsin is not the rate-limiting step, while minimizing the effect of trypsin on enzyme stability. Assay progression curves should be linear for at least 30 min (see\nTroubleshooting\nsection).\nExample: incubate enzyme (10 nM), substrate (200 \u00b5M), and NAD\n+\n(500 \u00b5M; only for sirtuins) with trypsin at 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 \u00b5g/mL concentration for 90 min with fluorescence reads every 30 s.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Optional: determine the Michaelis-Menten constant (\nK\nM\n) of the substrate. This will be useful for ensuring that substrate concentration is appropriate for maintaining steady-state conversion, and for determining inhibitor\nK\ni\nvalues from the obtained IC\n50\n.\nExample: incubate enzyme (10 nM), NAD\n+\n(500 \u00b5M; only for sirtuins), and trypsin (4 \u00b5g/mL) with substrate at 195, 130, 87, 58, 38, 26, 17, 11, 7.6, 5.1, 3.4 and 2.3 \u00b5M concentration (1.5-fold dilution) for 60\u201290 min with fluorescence reads every 30 s, measure initial conversion rates and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine the substrate K\nM\n.\nContinuous inhibition assays:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Estimate the inhibitor potency (IC\n50,est\n) with a small number of end-point or continuous assays.\nExample (end-point): incubate enzyme and substrate (and NAD\n+\n) with inhibitor at 10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 \u00b5M concentration for 30 min, add trypsin developer (200 \u00b5g/mL) and read after 10 min assay development. Estimate the inhibitor IC\n50\nby comparing to the control without inhibitor.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perform dose-response continuous inhibition assays (2-fold dilutions) with the preferred concentrations of enzyme and trypsin (and NAD\n+\n) starting at 20 times the IC\n50,est\n.\nExample: for IC\n50,est\n= 1 nM, incubate enzyme (10 nM) and substrate (200 \u00b5M (and 500 \u00b5M NAD\n+\n)) with inhibitor at 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.62, 0.31, 0.16, 0.078, and 0.039 nM concentration for 90 min with fluorescence reads every 30 s, or until the progression curve from control wells without inhibitor deviate from a straight line.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Visually assess final substrate conversion at each concentration of inhibitor, and repeat experiments with alternative inhibitor concentrations until covering the range from no inhibition to full inhibition.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perform final experiments twice in order to report data as average\u00a0\u00b1 SD of two individual experiments.\nData processing and fitting (instructions for GraphPad Prism 7.0):\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paste data in Prism as two replicate values in side-by-side sub columns, and enter time points as \u201cX\u201d values. Place baseline data in \u201cGroup A\u201d, and label all other groups with the concentration of inhibitor employed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Optional: transform data from fluorescence units to concentration of AMC. A standard AMC concentration curve must be obtained for the plate reader employed, which can be then included in Prism under \u201cTransform\u201d \u2013 \u201cUser-defined Y functions\u201d.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use \u201cRemove Baseline and Column Math\u201d to remove baseline fluorescence (Group A) from all data sets.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plot data from duplicate wells as discrete data points, in order to identify outliers and experimental errors (\u201cNew Graph of Existing Data\u2026\u201d, with the option \u201cCreate a new graph for each data set\u201d). Data with low signal-to-noise ratio (for example, due to full inhibition of the enzyme) may be discarded, especially in the case of slow-binding inhibitors.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use control data without inhibitor to determine the time frame of analysis in which the progression curve follows a straight line. Discard all data outside of this time frame.\nExample: discard data from 0 to 3 min if steady-state conversion is not reached and all data after 60 min if the conversion rate starts to decrease.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plot all remaining data in a single figure, as mean values with error bars for each concentration of inhibitor and assess the shape of each progression curve. If all experiments follow straight lines (\nfast-on/fast-off kinetics\n), go to\npoint 7\n, otherwise continue from\npoint 8\n(\nslow-binding kinetics\n).\n7.\nFast-on/fast-off kinetics\n: fit each progression curve to a straight line (\u201cAnalyze\u201d \u2013 \u201cNonlinear regression\u201d \u2013 \u201cStraight line\u201d) and select \u201cCreate summary table and graph\u201d to obtain a XY type of graph with the Slopes and the concentrations of inhibitor.

IC\n50\nvalues can be transformed into\nK\ni\nvalues using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (\nEq. 2\n).\n8.\nSlow-binding kinetics\n: fit control data without inhibitor to a straight line, and all other progression curves to\nEq. 3\n, which takes into account initial and final conversion rates (\nV\nin\nand\nV\nss\n, respectively) and provides the observed rate at which the equilibrium is reached (\nk\nobs\n).

Create a XY summary table with\nk\nobs\ndata and the concentration of inhibitor, and exclude conditions for which the standard error exceeds the mean\nk\nobs\nvalue.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collect\nk\nobs\ndata from two individual experiments, create a data sheet with both data sets, and fit\nk\nobs\ndata (\u201cAnalyze\u201d \u2013 \u201cNonlinear regression\u201d)\u00a0to either\nEq. 4\n(linear correlation, \u201cStraight line\u201d) or\nEq. 5\n(hyperbolic correlation, added as Y = kminus2+k2*X/(X+Ki1*(1+S/Km)), with\nK\nM\nconstrained to be the value calculated before).\nEq. 4\ncorresponds to\nmechanism A\nof slow-binding kinetics, in which there is a single slow binding step (E + I\n\u21cc\nEI) with kinetic constants\nk\n1\n(direct) and\nk\n\u20131\n(inverse).\nEq. 5\ncorresponds to\nmechanism B\nof slow-binding kinetics, where there is a fast binding step followed by a slow transition between enzyme-inhibitor complexes (E + I\n\u21cc\nEI\n\u21cc\nEI*). Mechanism B is characterized by the\nK\ni,1\nequilibrium constant for the first step and kinetic constants\nk\n2\nand\nk\n\u20132\nfor the second step.\n6,13\nSummary tables provide values for all constants when possible.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0Calculate the potency of the inhibitor (\nK\ni\n) using\nEq. 6\nfor inhibitors following mechanism A and\nEq. 7\nfor mechanism B. This will not be possible for irreversible inhibitors (\nk\n\u20131\nor\nk\n\u20132\nconstants close to 0).\n6\n11. Calculate dissociative half-life values (t\n1/2\ndiss\n) using\nEq. 8\nfor inhibitors following mechanism A and\nEq. 9\nfor mechanism B.\n2,18\nSince\nk\n\u20131\nconstants are not elucidated for mechanism B-type of inhibitors, the limiting scenario in which\nk\n\u20131\nis much larger than\nk\n\u20132\nmay be considered, which provides the lowest\u00a0t\n1/2\ndiss\npossible."

Here, we describe a robust and uncomplicated in vitro assay for HDAC inhibitor kinetic profiling. Enzyme and fluorogenic peptide substrate are incubated together with a small amount of protease \u201cassay developer\u201d, which enables continuous recording of substrate conversion under steady-state conditions. Assay progression curves upon addition of an inhibitors at varying concentrations permit determination of kinetic constants and overall inhibitor potency. This assay helped&nbsp;provide new insight into the kinetic properties of known HDAC inhibitors as well as the kinetic characterization of both inhibitors and substrates of sirtuin enzymes, which are class III HDACs involved in metabolic control and oncogene regulation.</p>",
