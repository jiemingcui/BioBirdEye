Further study and characterization of exRNAs and their carriers could lead to identification of new biomarkers and have potential for development of novel therapeutics."

It supercedes an earlier protocol \\(http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/protex.2015.116). The new protocol is based on our experience vetting the original protocol in multiple labs. The major change is an increase in input volume of biofluid from 200 \u00b5L to 500 \u00b5L. We found that the larger input volume led to more reproducible amounts of RNA isolation across multiple experiments. We have also included footnotes to explain changes we made to manufacturers' protocols, and observations that were made while carrying out the protocols.",
