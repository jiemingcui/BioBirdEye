            "content": "The miRNAs are non-coding small RNAs that can regulate target mRNAs by interaction with the complementary 3\u2019 UTR sequence, blocking the mRNA translation or promoting its degradation \\(1,2). miRNA expression has been extensively studied on cellular physiology and several pathologies, as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases by bacteria, viruses and parasites \\(3-9).\r\n\n\nThe role of miRNAs in the regulation of nitric oxide synthase 2 \\(NOS2) expression in macrophages infected with _L. \\(L.) amazonensis_ was previously analyzed with the use of miRNAs inhibitors and target protectors. The inhibition of miR-294/ _Nos2_ and miR721/ _Nos2_ interactions with miRNA inhibitor or target protectors increased NOS2 expression and consequently, increased the nitric oxide \\(NO) production leading to the reduction of parasite infectivity. The 3\u2019 UTR of _Nos2_ mRNA encompasses the predicted sequence for miR-294 or miR-721 interactions. The analysis of these interactions were designed for pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector and the obtained results supported the role of these miRNAs in the regulation of NOS2 expression during _L. \\(L.) amazonensis_ infection \\(10).\r\n\n\nHere, we focused on the use of transient transfection of exogenous single-stranded RNAs for validation of miRNA-mRNA interactions through inhibitory and competitive assays in bone marrow derived-macrophages \\(Figure 1).  miRNA functionality was validated by RT-qPCR and In-cell western assays for mRNA quantification and protein expression, respectively. miRNA interaction with the complementary 3\u2019UTR of the target mRNA was confirmed through the transient transfection of the macrophages with a plasmid DNA containing the miRNA target sequence downstream of the firefly luciferase reporter in combination with double-stranded miRNA mimics \\(Figure 2).\r\n\n\nThe study of down-regulation of miRNA activity or its over-expression by a transient transfection is one of the most powerful ways to understand miRNA function. The miRNA inhibitors \\(Figure 1A) are chemically modified with antisense oligonucleotides containing full or partial reverse complementary sequences of the mature miRNA to be studied. This strategy can reduce the endogenous levels of miRNA with high specificity and affinity \\(11,12). Target protectors are exogenous single-strand RNAs containing the partial complementary reverse sequence of 3' UTR of mRNA target that can promote a protection of target mRNA interaction with specific mature miRNA and allow the target-mRNA translation  \\(Figure 1B). Another strategy consists in the use of miRNA mimics \\(Figure 1C) that are synthetic oligonucleotides, usually double stranded and chemically modified, that are identical to the selected miRNA targeting mRNAs \\(13). The use of miRNA inhibitors or mimics leads to maximum and robust in vitro effects throughout the entire research project and support their potential as targets for therapies of several diseases. The advantage miRNA approaches is based on their ability to target multiple mRNAs and signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, resting, differentiation, proliferation, activation and apoptosis."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "The binding of microRNA \\(miRNA) to the 3\u2019 UTR of its target mRNAs leads to the mRNAs cleavage or the repression of protein synthesis. The study of miRNA interactions/modifications is essential to elucidate the cellularits function. The present protocol describes a transient transfection of exogenous single-stranded RNAs into bone marrow-derived macrophages \\(BMDM) to analyze miRNA inhibition/competition through RT-qPCR and/or In-cell western. In addition, we standardized a protocol for the study miRNA/mRNA interactions with the transient over-expression of double-stranded miRNA mimics together with a pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector containing the target miRNA inserted downstream of the luciferase reporter gene. These approaches can suggest potential targets for the development of therapies for several diseases. The entire procedure requires nearly 2 weeks.",
