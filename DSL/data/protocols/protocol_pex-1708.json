            "content": "Day (-2): Cell aggregation\n(for 2 plates of 96-well plate)\nMaterials\nPreparation:\n32 ml of E8 medium with 64 \u03bcl of Normocin (Final concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml) Distribute this E8 medium with Normocin into 2 conical tubes.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010 ml of medium to 15 ml conical tube\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a022 ml of medium to 50 ml conical tube\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, add 10 \u03bcl of Y to the 10 ml medium, which brings the final concentration to 10 \u03bcM Y (hereafter, E8-10Y), and 44 \u03bcl of Y to the 22 ml medium, which brings final concentration to 20 \u03bcM Y (hereafter, E8-20Y)\nCell dissociation:\n1. Aspirate spent medium of the cells in one well of a 6-well culture plate\n2. Wash with 2.5 ml of 1X DPBS twice, and aspirate the DPBS from the last wash.\n3. Add 500 \u03bcl of Accutase and incubate for 3-4 mins in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5.0% CO2; after 3 mins of incubation, shake the plate horizontally and check under a microscope to confirm that the cells are all detached from the surface of the plate. If clusters of adhered cells are still present, incubate extra 20 seconds to 1 minute (total 4 minutes), based on the percentage of adherent cell portion, until the cells are fully detached and partially single-celled.\n4. Using a 5 ml serological pipette, aliquot 5 ml of E8-10Y to a sterile 15 ml tube\n5. Using 3 ml from step #4 E8-10Y with a 5 ml serological pipette, gently pipette up-and-down to break up the cell clusters into single cells in the well where cells were detached by Accutase treatment.\n6. Then, collect all cell suspension back into the step #4 tube with a final volume at 5.5 ml.\n7. Centrifuge for 5 minutes and 30 seconds at 230 rcf at room temperature to pellet cells.\n8. Carefully and completely remove the supernatant by aspiration (be cautious not to disturb the cell pellet). Tilt the tube to flow the medium away from the pellet for aspiration.\n9. Using a p1000 tip, resuspend cells in 1 ml of E8-10Y by gently pipetting up and down.\nCell aggregation:\n10. To equilibrate the cell strainer, forcefully pipette 1 ml of E8-10Y medium through the cell strainer mesh.\n11. Pipette resuspended cells in E8-10Y onto the cell strainer in a drop-wise manner.\n12. To thoroughly collect cells, rinse the conical tube, where the cells were resuspended and transferred, with 1 ml of E8-10Y medium and pipette onto the cell strainer in a drop-wise manner.\n13. Carefully remove and discard the cell strainer snap cap.\n14. Prepare 50 \u03bcl of Trypan blue in a 500 \u03bcl tube.\n15. Using a p1000 tip, pipette up and down the cell suspension in the test tube to mix evenly.\n16. Immediately, using a p200 tip, collect 50 \u03bcl of cell suspension from the center of the volume in the test tube, and transfer it into the 50 \u03bcl of Trypan blue prepared ahead - this makes 1:1 dilution of the cells and Trypan blue.\n17. Carefully pipette up-and-down to evenly mix the cells with trypan blue.\n18. Add 11 \u03bcl of Cell:Trypan blue mixture into both sides of the cell counting chamber slide for Invitrogen Countess II automated counter or on the hemocytometer (Disposable cell counting chamber slides for Invitrogen Countess II; Invitrogen, Cat. No. C10228)\n19. Calculate the number of cells, considering the 1:1 trypan blue dilution. Note: The Invitrogen Countess II automated counter automatically calculates and gives you the number considering trypan blue dilution.\nCalculate the volume of cell suspension needed for cell culture. The final cell concentration of\n35,000 cells/ml\nis needed for a differentiation culture. Therefore, in 22 ml, 7.7 x 105 cells are needed.\n20. After the calculation, remove the same volume with the cell suspension that is needed for culture from the 22 ml of E8-20Y medium that was prepared earlier, and then, add the adequate volume of your cell suspension to that E8-20Y medium.\n23. For example, if the cell suspension concentration is 5 x 105 cells per ml, 1.54 ml of the cell suspension is needed for culture in 22 ml of medium (easy to memorize equation: total number of cells needed for culture / number of cells in 1 ml of cell suspension). Therefore, remove 1.54 ml of E8-20Y from the 22 ml and add 1.54 ml of cell suspension into the 20.46 ml of E8-20Y medium, which brings the final cell concentration to 7.7 x 105 cells in 22 ml of E8-20Y medium.\n24. Invert several times or swirl the tube to mix the cell suspension evenly.\nPour the 22 ml cell suspension into a 25 ml reservoir.\n25. Using a multi-channel pipette, aliquot 100 \u03bcl of cell suspension into each of 96-well U-bottom plates.\n26. Spin down the plates at 110 rcf for 6 min at room temperature.\n27. Incubate the plates in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5.0% CO2 for 24 hours.\nDay (-1): Dilution of Y solution\nPreparation:\n22 ml of fresh E8 medium containing 44 \u03bcl of Normocin (WITHOUT Y).\n1. Pour 22 ml of fresh E8 medium into a 25 ml reservoir.\n2. Using a multichannel pipette, add 100 \u03bcl of E8 medium into each well, which brings total volume to 200 \u03bcl per well.\n3.

Within that one-week period, for experiments up to differentiation day 45, perform half-medium changes every three days (i.e. Full-medium change on Monday, half-medium changes on Thursday and Sunday, then full-medium change on Tuesday). For longer experiments, i.e. after differentiation day 45, perform half medium changes every other day. Also, based on the organoid sizes (i.e. larger) and medium consumption rate (i.e. color of medium changing to yellow), increase total volume to 1 ml per well to provide proper nutrition."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>The inner ear detects sound, head movements, and gravity using specialized epithelial cells and neurons. Decreased function in these cells can lead to hearing loss and dizziness. Inner ear disorders impact millions worldwide; however, current therapeutic options are limited. While animal models are a powerful system to assess auditory and vestibular dysfunction, <em>in vitro</em> inner ear models are gaining importance in translational research. Here, we provide a stepwise approach for generating inner ear organoids (IEOs), which contain supporting cells, hair cells, and neurons. Our differentiation regimen, using defined medium components and diluted extracellular matrix proteins, guides a 3D spheroid of pluripotent stem cells into otic progenitor cells by mimicking the environmental cues that occur during fetal development. Control of the TGF and BMP pathways early in the culture, promotes patterning of the spheroid, with an outer layer of surface ectoderm and an inner core of neuroectoderm. Later, FGF activation and BMP inhibition induce placode formation in the outer layer and neural crest cell migration from the core. These two cell lineages co-develop into otic vesicle-like structures surrounded by a layer of mesenchymal, neuronal, and glial cells that can be maintained in culture for over 100 days. The IEOs described in this protocol are a promising tool for otology research.&nbsp;</p>",
