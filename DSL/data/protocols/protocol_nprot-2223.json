            "content": "Flow cytometry has clear applications to phenotyping malaria parasites, particularly during the intraerythrocytic stages. Because erythrocytes are anuclear, erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum can be detected and distinguished from noninfected erythrocytes using DNA dyes, and several cytometric protocols have now been published using flow cytometry to count P. falciparum growth using fluorescent DNA dyes \\(1-3). However, such assays alone cannot be used to phenotype erythrocyte invasion because phenotyping invasion depends not only on counting parasites but also counting which erythrocytes the parasites have invaded. All invasion assays involve adding P. falciparum parasites to erythrocytes with a limited subset of erythrocyte receptors \\(for example, erythrocytes from known human blood group variants or erythrocytes that have been treated with enzymes to remove specific receptors) and scoring parasite density 48 h later. The reason that standard growth assays cannot be applied in this context is because uninfected \\(and hence untreated) erythrocytes are always present at some level in the starting parasite culture \\(referred to hereafter as \u2018\u2018donor\u2019\u2019 cells). For invasion to be phenotyped, it is essential that parasites present in donor cells are not counted, whereas parasites that have invaded the erythrocytes with a reduced receptor repertoire \\(referred to hereafter as \u2018\u2018target\u2019\u2019 cells) are counted.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn previous assays, this fundamental problem in phenotyping invasion has been overcome by one of two approaches. In one, purification methods are used in an attempt to eliminate all uninfected erythrocytes from the donor culture, but purification requires larger volumes of culture and is not suited to high throughput assays of multiple lines. The widely used alternative involves pretreating the donor culture with a combination of enzymes, usually neuraminidase and trypsin, in order to cleave all available erythrocyte invasion receptors. This approach is designed to prevent reinvasion into all uninfected erythrocytes present in the donor culture and limit invasion to the target erythrocytes \\(4, 5). This has recently been successfully combined with a fluorescent DNA dye to allow measurement using flow cytometry \\(6), but necessarily involves serial manipulation of the P. falciparum culture and exposing it to enzymes that are sometimes present in nonphysiological buffers.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTo minimize parasite handling, two-color flow cytometry was investigated as an alternative to quantitate erythrocyte invasion. Unlabeled donor P. falciparum cultures were coincubated with target erythrocytes that had been labeled with fluorescent dyes, and parasites present in the donor and target population were quantitated using fluorescent DNA dyes. Multiple DNA dyes were tested and protocols adjusted to minimize background. Cell dyes were chosen to have minimal emission overlap with the best performing DNA dyes and to label erythrocytes cytoplasmically rather than on the erythrocyte surface as has been used previously \\(7), reasoning that surface labels may reduce invasion efficiencies and therefore reduce the sensitivity of the assay. This combinational approach resulted in the identification of several dye combinations that recapitulate known invasion phenotypes, meaning that the assay can be adapted to multiple flow cytometers, depending on the laser lines available. This 96-well plate-based adaptable phenotyping platform should be of broad utility for measuring the impact of natural or experimental genetic variation in either host or parasite on erythrocyte invasion efficiency and could be applied to genotype-phenotype association studies."

The fluorescence emission peak of CFDA SE is approximately 517nm, close to SYBR Green I at about 520nm. CFDA SE can thus only be used in combination with Hoechst 33342. The fluorescence emission peak of DDAO SE is close to 657nm. So, it can be used in combination with either Hoechst 33342 or SYBR Green I.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "To facilitate the scale-up of erythrocyte invasion phenotyping for Plasmodium falciparum, we have developed a novel platform based on two-color flow cytometry that distinguishes parasite invasion from parasite growth. Target cells that had one or more receptors removed using enzymatic treatment were prelabeled with intracellular dyes CFDA-SE or DDAO-SE, incubated with P. falciparum parasites, and parasites that had invaded either labeled or unlabeled cells were detected with fluorescent DNA-intercalating dyes Hoechst 33342 or SYBR Green I. Neither cell label interfered with erythrocyte invasion, and the combination of cell and parasite dyes recapitulated known invasion phenotypes for three standard laboratory strains. Three different dye combinations with minimal overlap have been validated, meaning the same assay can be adapted to instruments harboring several different combinations of laser lines. The assay is sensitive, operates in a 96-well format, and can be used to quantitate the impact of natural or experimental genetic variation on erythrocyte invasion efficiency.",
