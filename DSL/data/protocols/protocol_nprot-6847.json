            "content": "Metamaterial inspired designs have been successfully tested in several  applications such as gradient negative index lenses, invisibility cloaking, metasurface sub-wavelength imaging  \\[1-4],  and many more. Their entry in structural health monitoring \\(SHM) of Aerospace, Civil and Mechanical \\(ACM) engineering \\[5-7] started attracting engineers because of their strong electromagnetic \\(EM) response to the geometrical changes in the unit element or assemblies of elements \\[8], making it suitable for \u2018strain\u2019 monitoring, which is a common issue for most ACM structures.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n    Metamaterial inspired LSP sensors are highly non-fragile, which are manufactured as bi-material composites, made of metal inscriptions on flexible and ultra-thin Rogers materials \\(RT5880) using PCB technique. These are bent and twisted-able; and do not require fragile packaging, unlike FBG sensors and moreover their \u2018waveguides that transfer EM waves\u2019  do not need any protection unlike optical fiber cables. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n       Most of the present designs are mostly based on the generation of \\(A) \u2018progressive wave\u2019 that travel long distances in the \u2018far fields\u2019 \\(air medium); and \\(B) the measurement of the scattered parameters in the far fields. Thus, EM radiation leakages or reflections are common, which forces experimentation in special anechoic chambers. Thus, they were used mostly for biological or medical applications, but not for ACM applications \\[9]. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThese EM radiations in the microwave range are harmless, and their applications for ACM engineering structure can be considered without any isolation. Hence, \u2018near field\u2019 based LSP sensor using the robotic arm and waveguide technique is adopted in our study published in Springer's Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation \\[10]. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis technique was evaluated in terms of sensitivity for a couple of ACM engineering specimens as demonstrated in Figs 1-6, that shows its potential applications for SHM. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n  These LSPs, in contact with the \u2018engineering structure under inspection\u2019 generate a diagnosable surface plasmons/ wave as output, when subjected to input EM waves in the near fields. This paper is an extension of our article \\[10], presents a procedure to analyse the sensitivity of the output surface wave. \r\n\n\n     \r\n\n\n      The Springer article primarily presented a novel method of transferring \u2018surface waves\u2019 from within the confined boundaries of the LSP sensor to the far-off distance along a guided path. Our several articles in the last few years explored the spoof LSP sensor \\[6, 10 -12], first developed a few years ago by Shen and co-researcher group \\[13] which resembles a piezoelectric diaphragm \\[14], but it is ultra thin and bendable unlike piezo. In experiments, the input \u2013 EM waves and the output \u2013 surface waves were handled by a vector network analyser via a 2D robotic arm. Signals generated by LSP; and, LSP plus waveguide were analyzed for monitoring \\(A) metal shell\u2019s surface profile and \\(B) separation of two adjacent concrete blocks. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFurther, in this article, the sensitivity of the output signals using a unique root mean square deviation \\(RMSD) index is presented."

In our study \\[10], this robotic arm was used to hold and move one coaxial cable that supplied either input EM waves at intermittent predefined locations or acquired output surface waves at instructed locations, but not for both simultaneously.

This shell is 7 cm in height and 20 cm in width. The arm was instructed to move along X axis above the surface of LSP sensor. During its motion, the input EM wave was supplied from a fixed location on LSP sensor while the output was obtained at several locations starting from a \\(0 mm) to A \\(20 mm). The sensor was curve-linear, but has a steeper slope on one side from the midpoint \\(M =10 mm). More about this can be obtained in our associated publication \\[10]. \r\n\n\n\\(2)\nSee figure in Figures section.\n\\[Click to Enlarge]\nFigure 2 shows the schematic implementation of  LSP sensor and lead waveguide. The LSP is attached to one block while the waveguide laid \\(spread) from the center of the sensor perpendicular to block's length. The adjacent concrete block was moved from close to far from the first block. The process of concrete blocks separation, i.e movement of a second block from 0 cm \\(no separation) to 9 cm  was monitored. The input was supplied at a fixed location above LSP sensor, whereas the output was extracted at several locations above the surface of the waveguide along X direction as shown in figure \\[10]. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(3)\nSee figure in Figures section.\n\\[Click to Enlarge]\nFigure 3 shows signals of scattered parameter \\(S21)  i.e. output transmission or surface wave magnitude obtained throughout the journey, starting from baseline \\(edge of the sensor), point a \\(0 mm - outside copper) until point A \\(20 mm - outside copper) for an input frequency range of 3 GHz to 7 GHz. It was observed that the magnitude of the resonance peak increased gradually from starting point to mid-point \\(M), then gradually dropped as the robotic-arm moved further from point M. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(4)\nSee figure in Figures section.\n\\[Click to Enlarge]\nThe signal is always a qualitative information useful for non-ACM engineering groups such as optics, physics, biology, etc. However, for ACM engineering groups, a more mathematical/ statistical quantitative method such as a Root Mean Square Deviation \\(RMSD) is additionally adopted for the obtained signals \\[10, 15]. Figure 4 shows the formula and the application procedure. The RMSD is represented as a percentage frequency function, which can increase or decrease or can be unstable with unpredictable fluctuations.  This RMSD is considered as a sensitivity measure of smart materials used for engineering monitoring \\[6, 11]. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5.\nSee figure in Figures section.\n\\[Click to Enlarge]\nFigure 5 shows the sensitivity \\(RMSD) of surface wave output as the robotic arm moved over the top of the curve-linear shell \\(and LSP sensor). The shape of the graph is similar to the shape of the shell, which was slightly steep on one side.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6.\nSee figure in Figures section.\n\\[Click to Enlarge]\nFigure 6 shows the sensitivity of the surface wave output above the waveguide, as the robotic arm moved over the top of linear waveguide. The increase of separation between the concrete blocks increased the RMSD. The signals are not shown here, but are available in the associated journal \\[10]. However, the RMSD graph shows more meaningful interpretation/ proportionality compared to raw signals."

More about this technique and few more experiments can be obtained in our recently published article in springer. As anticipated, RMSD indices clearly show the behaviour of the output surface waves during the output probe motion along X direction. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMetallic shell had a curve-linear surface profile and its surface profile were not properly understood in the raw transmission \\(S21) signals. However, the application of RMSD brought out the effective ability of this technique to trace the shell\u2019s surface profile. An important feature in aerospace and mechanical engineering. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAnother important feature of this technique is to adopt waveguide to monitor concrete cracks/ separation of two concrete blocks. RMSD indices clearly show the ability of this technique in tracing the separation. This can also be used for crack monitoring if properly adopted. A very important feature in civil engineering \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe probe motion was controlled by software developed in our laboratory \\(Nanyang Tech. University \u2013 Singapore). This coordinated very well with output cable, and the dipole. \r\n\n\nMore about this LSP based SHM technique can be studied from our published articles \\[6, 10, 11,12]. \r\n\n\nNote: If you wish to cite this article, please also cite its associate article published by Springer \\[10]."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Many electromagnetic \\(EM) metamaterial inspired designs such as localized surface plasmons \\(LSPs), have been extensively adopted for structural health monitoring \\(SHM) in the recent past. These LSPs, in contact with the \u2018engineering structure under inspection\u2019 generate a diagnosable surface plasmons/ wave as output, when subjected to input EM waves in the near fields. This paper, an extension to recently published article in Springer, presents a procedure to analyse the sensitivity of the output surface wave.  The Springer article primarily presented a novel method of transferring \u2018surface waves\u2019 from within the confined boundaries of the LSP sensor to the far-off distance along a guided path.  In experiments, the input - EM waves and the output - surface waves were handled by a vector network analyser via a 2D robotic arm. Signals generated by LSP sensor; and, LSP sensor plus waveguide was analysed for monitoring \\(a) metal shell's surface profile and \\(b) separation of two adjacent concrete blocks. Further, in this article, the sensitivity of the output signals using a unique root mean square deviation \\(RMSD) index is presented.",
