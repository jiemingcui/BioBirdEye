            "content": "<p>Particle size, particle distribution in the vitreous ice layer greatly impacts on the quality and attainable resolution of cryo-EM reconstructions<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp;To help overcome these performance barriers, we designed a novel class of chimeric molecules, called megabodies (Mbs).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Megabodies are built from&nbsp;a nanobody (Nb) that is grafted onto a scaffold protein via two short peptide linkers (<strong>Fig. 1a</strong>). Any nanobody can be converted into a megabody by linking the nanobody through its first \u03b2-turn (connecting \u03b2-strands A and B) to an exposed \u03b2-hairpin of selected scaffold proteins. For this purpose, we&nbsp;have identified&nbsp;two large&nbsp;secreted bacterial proteins that are amenable to circular permutation&nbsp;and contain antiparallel \u03b2-strands with surface accessible \u03b2-turns: \u03b2-turn S3-S4 of the adhesin domain of&nbsp;<em>H. pylori</em><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(HopQ, 45 kDa, PDB ID: 5LP2,<strong>&nbsp;Fig. 2a</strong>) and \u03b2-turn A\u2019S1-A\u2019S2 of the&nbsp;<em>E. coli&nbsp;</em>K12<em>&nbsp;</em>Glucosidase YgjK<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;(YgjK, 86 kDa, PDB ID: 3W7T,&nbsp;<strong>Fig. 2d</strong>). Here we describe how&nbsp;nanobodies can be grafted onto circular permutants of these molecular scaffolds to build megabodies of about 56 kDa (<strong>Fig. 1b</strong>)&nbsp;or 100 kDa (<strong>Fig. 1c</strong>), respectively using a single-step cloning procedure. We also provide protocols for the purification of milligram quantities of such megabodies from the periplasm of&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em>&nbsp;(<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). Produced megabodies&nbsp;retain the full antigen binding specificity and affinity of the parental nanobodies (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>).</p>"

Gene fragments encoding\u00a0\u03b2-strands B to G of the parental nanobodies (residues 18-128 according to the IMGT numbering,\nFig. 3a\n) need to be amplified by PCR with primers TU89 and EP230. Amplified fragments are next cloned as SapI fragments in the desired expression vector: pMESD2 (GenBank MT328400) or pMESD22c7 (GenBank MT338520) to generate\u00a0\u00a0or\u00a0\u00a0megabodies (~56 kDa), and pMESP23E2 (GenBank MT338521) or pMESP23NO (GenBank MT338522) to generate\u00a0\u00a0or\u00a0\u00a0megabodies (~100 kDa), respectively (\nFig. 3b-e\n).

Cut the 350-bp PCR product from a 1%\u00a0(wt/vol)\u00a0agarose gel and purify the fragment using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.
