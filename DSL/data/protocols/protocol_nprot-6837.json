            "content": "**Development of the protocol**\r\n\n\nLate-endosomes, also referred to as multivesicular bodies \\(MVBs), contain small intraluminal vesicles \\(ILVs) enriched in subsets of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. While the majority of MVBs might fuse with lysosomes to degrade their contents<sup>1</sup>, a subset of MVBs can alternatively fuse with PM, releasing its ILVs into the exterior of the cell<sup>2</sup>. Once released, these ILVs - now called exosomes \u2013 can partake in various physiological and pathophysiological processes, including development, angiogenesis, immune regulation, trophic support, cancer progression, and development of metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases<sup>3-7</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWhile the functions of exosomes post-secretion are relatively well covered in literature<sup>2,8</sup>, our knowledge of factors modulating specifically the release of exosomes remains sparse, precluding more definitive tests of their physiological relevance. This is mainly due to the lack of methods that can monitor direct, real-time effects of potential modulators on MVB-PM fusion, leaving us the more indirect, post-secretion based types of examination that usually require isolation \\(of secreted exosomes from culture supernatant or liquid biopsies) by differential ultra-centrifugation or size-exclusion chromatography \\(SEC) prior to downstream analysis. These methods are generally deployed to profile steady state levels of \\(sub-)populations of exosomes secreted over a long period of time in the culture supernatant or in biological fluids<sup>9,10</sup>. While instrumental for the characterization of exosomal content\\(s), these techniques are sub-optimal to study factors influencing the dynamics of secretion, as the extended time periods needed to acquire sufficient material allow for secondary effects of treatments and/or negative-feedback loops to occur. Furthermore, these techniques fail to distinguish MVB-derived exosomes from small PM-derived microvesicles due to the overlapping biophysical properties of these EVs.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we designed a pH-sensitive, CD63-based optical reporter \\(CD63-pHluorin) that can detect MVB-PM fusion using live-microscopy \\(Figure 1). Thanks to its nature, this approach allows for the direct visualization of MVB-PM fusion down to single-cell level, and can be applied to decipher a wide range of aspects of exosome secretion. Importantly, the CD63-pHluorin reporter provides the opportunity to distinguish secretion of MVB-derived exosomes from PM-derived EV release. In our original publication<sup>11</sup> we demonstrate its utility in unraveling exogenous physiological stimuli, intracellular signaling pathways, and fusion machinery involved in exosome release. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHere we describe a detailed protocol for the quantification of exosome release by single cell live microscopy using the CD63-pHluorin reporter. Although optimized for HeLa cells, this protocol has been used successfully with a number of other adherent cell types. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6777/original/figure_nature_protocol_exchange_2.png?1527599321\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\nFigure 1) Model for the visualization of MVB\u2013PM fusion.\r\n\n\nA pH-sensitive optical reporter \\(CD63-pHluorin) is quenched when facing the acidic lumen of the MVB. Upon fusion, low luminal pH is immediately neutralized, resulting in a sudden increase in fluorescent intensity that can be detected by live TIRF microscopy \\(upper right).

            "content": "In this protocol we describe the live imaging of MVB-PM fusion using the CD63-pHluorin reporter in HeLa cells. The protocol can be applied to other adherent cells although basal fusion rates were found to vary between cell types. Furthermore, the transient transfection of other cells might require a different transfection protocol. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Transient transfection of CD63-pHluorin**\r\n\n\n1. HeLa cells are maintained in a T75 flask in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 U/ml Penicillin G,1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 2 mM glutamine \\(full medium) in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. To passage, remove the culture medium, rinse the T75 flask with 2 ml PBS, add 2 ml trypsin and incubate the cells at 37 \u00b0C until the cells have detached \\(typically 3-5 min). After the cells have detached, add 8 ml full medium and resuspend the cells thoroughly to obtain a single cell suspension. Split the HeLa cells 2x a week at a 1:20 ratio. \r\n  2. Day 1. Seed the cells at a density of 25-30% on 18 mm round glass coverslips in the wells of a 12-well plate. Depending on the cell line used, the glass coverslips can be coated with Poly-L-Lysine before seeding. Alternatively, cells can be plated in 35 mm fluorodishes.\r\n  3. Day 2. Transfect the HeLa cells at 50-60% confluency with CD63-pHluorin plasmid DNA. Cells can be transfected using Lipofectamine 2000, JetPrime or another transfection reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\r\n  4. Lipofectamine transfection: dilute 500 ng CD63-pHluorin plasmid DNA in Optimem to a total volume of 100 ul. \r\n  5. Dilute 1.5 ul Lipofectamine 2000, a 1:3 ratio of DNA to Lipofectamine 2000, in Optimem to a total volume of 100 ul. \r\n  6. Add the 100 ul of Lipofectamine 2000 solution to the DNA solution, vortex the mixture for 10 seconds and incubate at room temperature for 10-15 min.  \r\n  7. Refresh the culture medium of the HeLa cells with pre-warmed full medium.\r\n  8. Add the total 200 ul of the transfection mix dropwise to the HeLa cells and incubate the cells for 6 hours. \r\n  9. Refresh the culture medium of the transfected cells with pre-warmed full medium and incubate for another 18 hours.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Live imaging of MVB-PM fusion**\r\n\n\n10. Day 3. When working with coverslips: Place the coverslip with CD63-pHluorin transfected HeLa cells in the imaging chamber. Cover the cells with imaging medium. We recommend the use of CO2-independent medium without phenol-red. We obtained good results with Tyrode\u2019s solution. \r\n  11. Place the imaging chamber or Fluorodish in the microscope stage holder. Note: We advise to use a microscope set-up equipped with a stage incubator for imaging at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. However, in certain cells \\(e.g. HeLa and HUVEC) it is possible to detect MVB-PM fusion activity without stage incubator by imaging at room temperature \\(21-24 \u00b0C) in Tyrode\u2019s solution.\r\n  12. Focus the imaging plane on the basal plasma membrane of CD63-pHluorin transfected HeLa cells.\r\n  13. For quantification of MVB-PM fusion activity, choose an imaging field, ideally containing 2 or more cells with average expression levels. To distinguish non-acidic vesicles moving towards the PM from acidic vesicles fusing with the PM, image at \u22652Hz \\(2fps, typically with an exposure time between 50-300ms) for a time period that allows for proper quantification \\(e.g. in HeLa for 3 min). Image \u22655 different fields. We highly recommend the use of a Perfect Focus System/Adaptive Focus Control \\(Nikon/Leica) to maintain focus at the PM. Use the lowest laser intensity and shortest exposure time possible to avoid phototoxicity. Note that fusion activity can vary between passage number and cell lines \\[see also Anticipated results].\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Image analysis: Quantifying MVB-PM fusion events**\r\n\n\n14. Load your imaging data in the appropriate software for image analysis. We routinely use ImageJ/Fiji. \r\n  15. MVB-PM fusion rate can be obtained by counting the number of fusion events that occur per minute. Important: Note that during live TIRF microscopy of CD63-pHluorin transfected cells, sudden increases in fluorescent intensity can be detected that are not a consequence of full MVB-PM fusion and thus do not report exosome release. The two main causes for these sudden increases in fluorescence are \\(transport) vesicles with neutral pH that move into the TIRF field, and so-called kiss-and-run events, which result from transient pore formation between MVBs and the PM without full fusion. Fortunately, these events can be discriminated from full MVB-PM fusion by analysis of the fluorescent profile right before and following initial fusion \\(Figure 2 and 3a). Here we provide a set of guidelines for the analysis of CD63-pHluorin live imaging data:\r\n  \r\n\n\nA burst of fluorescence is typically considered as exosome release event when:\r\n\n\n- it has a peak intensity of \u2265 1.5-fold above background \\(fluorescence from the PM)\r\n\n\n- reaches peak intensity in a maximum of two frames \\[when imaging at 2Hz]\r\n\n\n- has a size of at least 400 nm\r\n\n\n- shows minimal movement after the initial burst \\(As a rule of thumb we do not count vesicles that move more than twice the diameter of the vesicle)\r\n\n\n- has a duration of \u2265 2 sec, i.e. visible in > 4 consecutive frames \\[when imaging at 2Hz]\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n16. For more detailed analysis of a fusion event, a fluorescence intensity profile of the fusion event can be generated using ImageJ/FIJI \\(Figure 3a). To do this, first determine the diameter of the fusion event by drawing a straight line through the event at peak intensity. Then select the \u2018Plot Profile\u2019 option under \u2018Analyze\u2019 and determine the full width at half maximum \\(FWHM) of the fusion event. To plot the fluorescence intensity profile, draw a circular region of interest \\(ROI) around the fusion event. The diameter of the ROI should be twice the FWHM of the fusion event at its peak intensity. Then select \u2018Image\u2019\u2192\u2019Stacks\u2019\u2192\u2019Plot Z-Axis Profile\u2019. The data can be analyzed in ImageJ/FIJI or saved as .csv for subsequent analysis in Microsoft Excel or GraphPad Prism \\(Figure 3a).\nSee figure in Figures section.\nFigure 2) Heatmap time-lapse galleries of different types of CD63-pHluorin events obtained in HeLa cells. \r\n\n\nFull MVB-PM fusion and exosome release is characterized by a sudden increase in fluorescent intensity, followed by a gradual decrease of fluorescence at a fixed position. Kiss-and-run fusion events display a sudden increase in fluorescent intensity, but can be distinguished based on post-fusion movement and irregular decrease of fluorescent signal. Neutral vesicles can be observed during their approach to the PM, resulting in a slower increase in fluorescent intensity and can move in the TIRF field for prolonged time-periods."

Therefore, always include proper controls within each experiment.\r\n\n\n\u2022 In the original publication we have shown that under various conditions \\(GW4869 treatment and SNAP23-S110A expression) the MVB-PM fusion rate can be correlated to the amount of exosomes recovered in the supernatant by post-secretion isolation procedures under similar conditions. However, investigators should take into account that measurements done by direct observation of MVB-PM fusion with our protocol over a short time period are likely not always representative of the steady-state level of exosomes secreted over the much longer period of time that is required to isolate them post-secretion.\r\n\n\n\u2022 It is advisable when using established cell-lines to handle the cells with strict care and keep all conditions similar, preferably by keeping track of passage number. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSingle fusion events can be visualized best in a heatmap time-lapse gallery or fluorescent as in Figure 2 or fluorescent intensity profiles as in Figure 3a. The peak intensity of a MVB-PM fusion event should not move in the XY direction and show a gradual decrease in intensity over time. The localization of exosome release on the single cell level can be visualized in different ways, for example by a total projection of all fusion events over a time-course of several minutes as in Figure 3b.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7049/original/figure_nature_protocol_exchange_3.png?1533304672\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFigure 3) Anticipated results \r\n\n\na) Fluorescence intensity profile of a MVB-PM fusion event over time b) Projection of MVB-PM fusion events \\(yellow spots) in a HeLa cell \\(blue) over a time-course of 3 minutes."

In this protocol, we explain in practical detail how to apply live-visualization of MVB\u2013PM fusion to study the dynamics of exosome release from living single cells. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe explain how a CD63-based pH-sensitive optical reporter can be used for quantitative analysis of MVB-PM fusion and as a corollary CD63-positive exosome release. Our approach enables identification of exogenous stimuli, intracellular signaling pathways and fusion complexes that regulate exosome release from particular cell-types, as well as mapping of the sub-cellular localization of fusion events. The assay, that currently relies on transient transfection of cells, image acquisition and analysis can be typically performed within 3 days.",
