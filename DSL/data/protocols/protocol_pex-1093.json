            "content": "<p>Presently, direct reprogramming technology can be used to convert somatic cells into other cell types, without going through the pluripotent state. Using the direct cell-lineage reprogramming method, mouse and human hepatocyte-like cells (iHepCs) reportedly could be generated from fibroblasts<sup>1-4</sup>. iHepCs will be useful alternatives to hepatocytes in the treatment of liver diseases. However, human iHepCs (hiHepCs) cannot proliferate unless immortalized using the SV40 large T antigen, MYC, and p53-siRNA<sup>3,4</sup>. Such nonphysiological activation of hiHepC proliferation may increase the risk of transformation into cancerous cells. Thus, in clinical hiHepC applications, secure proliferation induction is required. Meanwhile, recent progress in direct reprogramming technology enabled the induction of human somatic stem/progenitor cells, including neural stem<sup>5,6</sup>, intestinal progenitor<sup>7</sup>, and blood progenitor<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;cells, while the possibility of human hepatic progenitor cell generation was elusive. In our recent study, we identified a specific combination of transcription factors such as FOXA3, HNF1A, and HNF6 that directly induce the conversion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and peripheral blood-derived endothelial cells (HPBECs) into cells with the properties of hepatic progenitor cells. These hiHepPCs can continuously produce their cell population in long-term monolayer cultures and differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes after cell aggregate and cystic epithelial spheroid formation, respectively, under three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>This protocol describes direct lineage reprogramming of human endothelial cells isolated from the umbilical vein and peripheral blood into hepatic progenitor cells. These induced human hepatic progenitor cells (hiHepPCs) proliferate in long-term culture and give rise to hepatocytes and cholangiocytes as descendants. To induce hiHepPCs from endothelial cells, we first established an efficient culture condition, enabling hiHepPC generation and propagation in a monolayer culture. Then, we confirmed the ability of the hiHepPCs to differentiate into mature hepatocytes by formation of cell aggregates in each well of ultra-low attachment 96-well plates. Furthermore, upon culturing in Matrigel, the hiHepPCs differentiated into cholangiocytes and formed cystic epithelial spheroids, similar to human liver-derived cholangiocytes. Direct induction of the expandable and bipotential human hepatic progenitor cells provides a possibility for generating cells such as hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, which will be useful for developing therapeutic strategies for human liver diseases.</p>",
