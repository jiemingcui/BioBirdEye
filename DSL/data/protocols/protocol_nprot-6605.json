            "content": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women with approximately 464,200 new cases per year in Europe. The median age at the time of primary diagnosis is about 58 years. Prognostic factors provide information about the future course of the disease when treated without systemic therapeutic intervention. Clinico-pathological risk factors for disease recurrence include axillary lymph node status, tumor size, histological grade, steroid hormone receptor status, vascular invasion, patient age, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \\(HER2)-status1. According to clinico-pathological risk classification for early breast cancer about 25% of the patients are considered to be at high risk, 65% are at intermediate risk and 10% are at low risk for disease recurrence. Patients at high-risk include those with more than three lymph nodes affected \\(independent from additional risk factors) or patients with one to three affected lymph nodes plus additional risk factors. According to current understanding, the high-risk group also includes patients with triple negative breast cancer \\(TNBC), i.e. patients with tumors negative for estrogen receptor \\(ER), progesterone receptor \\(PR) and HER2 expression 2.\r\n\n\nPatients at high risk for disease recurrence are recommended to receive according to international guidelines anthracycline-based chemotherapy \\(ANT) and patients at low risk for recurrence \u2013 those who are hormone receptor-positive patients per St. Gallen risk classification with no additional risk factors - will receive endocrine therapy \\(ET) only. For those at intermediate risk per St. Gallen classification, the decision to provide chemotherapy \\(CTX) is challenging. While before the era of genetic testing these patients were usually treated by CTX, genetic assays such as Endopredict\u00ae, OncotypeDX\u00ae, PAM50\u00ae, and Mammaprint\u00ae allow further risk stratification. Based on these assays about 60% of the intermediate risk group is considered to be at low risk for disease recurrence, i.e. those patients are adequately treated by ET only, while about 40% of the intermediate risk group actually bear a high risk for disease recurrence based on genetic testing and are recommended to be treated with CTX 3. However, for all of the patients with indication for CTX, up to 40% will benefit, but to date it is not possible to identify those patients who will benefit. The therascreen PITX2 assay will help to provide this information for high-risk lymph node-positive, estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative early stage breast cancer patients 4. Thus, the assay will support to guide the clinician to select the appropriate chemotherapy regimen for this patient group. See \"Figure 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6411/original/Figure1.png?1518707693 for a schematic.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nEpigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell's DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. DNA-methylation is a chemical process that adds a methyl group at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring of a cytosine nucleotide. It is highly specific and always occurs in a region in which a cytosine nucleotide is located next to a guanine nucleotide that is linked by a phosphate; called a CpG site. DNA-methylation is essential in the epigenetic regulation of mammalian development, it is an important regulator of gene transcription and it also forms the basis of chromatin structure, which enables a single cell to grow into multiple organs or perform multiple functions. DNA-methylation plays a crucial role in the development of a variety of cancers, including breast cancer 5. Methods to determine the methylation status of a gene of interest comprises several modification approaches of the genomic DNA to detect CpG dinucleotide-specific DNA-methylation by methylation specific restriction digestion or immunoprecipitation assays.\r\n\n\nThese assay formats are often demanding a high input of DNA, low throughput capacities and/or laborious and time-consuming post processing steps. Another approach uses a bisulfite conversion step, which induces deamination of unmethylated cytosines to uracil whereas methylated cytosines remain unchanged. The later approach facilitates the detection of methylation signals by sequence changes and can be adapted either for bisulfite-conversion-specific DNA detection on oligonucleotide arrays, bisulfite sequencing, methylation specific PCR or quantitative methylation-specific real-time PCR 6. The later method combines the advantages of relative low complexity of assay set-up \\(by using primers and specific TaqMan\u00ae probes), high reliability and the option for high throughput analysis with a short overall workflow time of two days. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSo far, the clinical utility for this in vitro diagnostic assay was confirmed for high-risk, lymph node-positive, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers only. The protocol is primarily intended for use in a certified routine diagnostic laboratory environment based on a CE-certified workflow. The multicentric EU-FP6-project project LSHC-CT-2003-504586 delivered initial findings with fresh-frozen breast cancer tumor tissue specimens obtained from several European tumor banks by screening for prognostic and predictive biomarkers on a proprietary bisulfite-converted DNA-specific oligonucleotide array. PITX2 hereby showed prognostic 7, and a predictive value in endocrine-treated lymph node-negative 8 and anthracycline-treated lymph node-positive breast cancer patients 9. Based on these array results, a quantitative methylation-specific real-time PCR assay on the TaqMan\u00ae oligonucleotide hydrolysis principle was developed for highest predictive impact 8, using bisulfite-converted DNA specific primers and two distinctive fluorescent labelled probes for the methylated \\(FAMTM) and unmethylated \\(HEXTM) status of three CpG motifs in the PITX2 gene promoter 2 region \\(for sequences of primers and probes please refer to patent by the authors EP1561821 10). A correlation study of this quantitative PCR assay with array results performed on 245 samples of tamoxifen-treated, node-negative breast cancer cases showed high concordance \\(Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.87) 8.\r\n\n\nSince fresh-frozen tumor samples are not always available as a tissue resource, but formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue \\(FFPE) material is part of routine in breast cancer centers associated pathologies, another study 11 showed a) high correlation between PMR status in fresh-frozen versus FFPE material \\(r=0.81) and b) low impact of overall tumor heterogeneity in consecutive sections of a tumor sample. The following protocol comprises an optimized workflow from FFPE tumor material processing, bisulfite conversion and quantitative methylation-specific real-time PCR for the assessment of PITX2 PMR value using the therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit \\(QIAGEN), QIAGEN kits for sample processing and the Rotor-Gene Q MDx real-time PCR platform optimized for in vitro diagnostic analysis purposes. This protocol was developed by the companies HalioDx \\(Marseille, France) and QIAGEN \\(Hilden, Germany) in cooperation with Therawis Diagnostics GmbH \\(Munich, Germany). For an overview of the assay workflow see \"Table 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6413/original/Table1.pdf?1518707728 and \"Figure 2\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6415/original/Figure2.jpg?1518707744.\r\n\n\nThe analytically validated assay could provide scientist and clinicians a tool not only to introduce the test in the clinical routine setting but also to conduct scientific research and translational research studies in various cancer indications. PITX2-related literature shows potential usability of the therascreen PITX2 assay in indications like head and neck cancer 12, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 13, non small cell lung cancer 14, colorectal cancer 15, ovarian cancer 16, bladder cancer 17 and prostate cancer 18,19. Furthermore, the assay allows to investigate the role of the transcription factor PITX2 and the regulated Wnt/\u00df-catenin pathway in pathophysiological processes 15,20-22.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor overall workflow control, one vial containing one histological section \\(15 to 20 \u00b5m thick) of KRAS G13D Reference Standard \\(Horizon Discovery, cat. no. HD216) can be used. qPCR controls comprise two positive controls \\(REF50, REFlow) and two negative controls \\(NC, NTC)."

Make sure that all kit reagents are not used after their expiry date and have been transported and stored under the correct conditions. Tissue specimens should be fixed in 4\u201310% formalin \\(neutral buffered formalin is generally accepted) as quickly as possible after surgical removal of the biopsy. Ideally, use a fixation time of 14\u201324 hrs \\(longer fixation times lead to more severe DNA fragmentation, resulting in poor performance in qPCR/qMSP assays). Thoroughly dehydrate samples prior to embedding \\(residual formalin can inhibit proteinase K digest). Five \u00b5m thick sections must be cut from the paraffin block. All chemicals and biological materials are potentially hazardous. Specimens and samples are potentially infectious and must be treated as biohazardous materials. Discard samples and assay waste according to your local safety procedures. The entire therascreen PITX2 workflow requires transfer of samples in different tubes, therefore make sure that the traceability of the samples is well maintained at each step.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA list of reagents to perform this workflow is listed in \"Table 2\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6417/original/Table2.pdf?1518707766\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n* These entries are interchangeable according to the selected deparaffinization step protocol used.\r\n  If not stated otherwise in \"Table 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6413/original/Table1.pdf?1518707728, store all buffers and components at room temperature \\(15-25\u00b0C).\r\n\n\nAn overview of potential hazardous substances used or included in kit constituents and their respective safety actions is presented in \"Table 3\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6419/original/Table3.pdf?1518707795.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nREAGENT SETUP\r\n\n\nThe therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit has been validated in combination with QIAGEN deparaffinization solution \\(cat. no. 19093) for FFPE histologic section deparaffinization; the QIAamp DSP DNA FFPE Tissue Kit \\(cat. no. 60404) for genomic DNA \\(gDNA) purification; and the EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit \\(cat. no. 59824 or 59826) for gDNA bisulfite conversion. Deparaffinization of FFPE histologic sections can be performed using deparaffinization solution, xylene-ethanol, or histolemon-ethanol \\(equivalency of these three deparaffinization methods was proven during product development by the company HalioDx). If the deparaffinization solution \\(cat. no. 19093) is used, start with the procedure at step 6 of the procedure section. If xylene-ethanol or histolemon-ethanol is used, start with the procedure at step 17 of the procedure section. Optional: to assess whether purification and bisulfite conversion was conducted correctly, a workflow control can be used. The workflow control validated for the therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit workflow is the KRAS G13D Reference Standard \\(15-20 \u00b5m section sample; Horizon Discovery, cat. no. HD216).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStarting material:\r\n\n\nStarting material for DNA purification is freshly cut histological sections of FFPE tissue, which can be stored overnight at room temperature, if required. Up to two sections, each with a thickness of 5 \u00b5m and a total surface area \u2265100 mm\u00b2, is the starting material for gDNA purification.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nGeneral working comments:\r\n\n\n\u2022 Before starting an experiment please follow the instructions of the respective kit protocols.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Carefully apply the sample or solution to the QIAamp MinElute column.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Pipet the sample into the QIAamp MinElute column without wetting the rim of the column.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Always change pipet tips between liquid transfers. We use aerosol-barrier pipet tips.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Avoid touching the QIAamp MinElute column membrane with the pipet tip. \r\n\n\n\u2022 After all pulse-vortexing steps, briefly centrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes to remove drops from the inside of the lids.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Open only one QIAamp MinElute column at a time, and take care to avoid generating aerosols.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Wear gloves throughout the entire procedure. In case of contact between gloves and sample, change gloves immediately.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Always close QIAamp MinElute columns before placing them in the microcentrifuge. Centrifuge as described in the protocol.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Flow-through fractions may contain hazardous waste and should be disposed of appropriately.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Perform all centrifugation steps at room temperature \\(15\u201325 \u00b0C).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nKit-specific working comments:\r\n\n\nQIAamp DSP DNA FFPE Tissue Kit:\r\n\n\n\u2022 Before starting the procedure, check whether precipitate has formed in Buffer ATL. If necessary, dissolve by heating to 70\u00b0C with gentle agitation.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Before starting the procedure, check whether precipitate has formed in Buffer AL. If necessary, dissolve by heating to 70\u00b0C with gentle agitation.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add molecular grade ethanol \\(96\u2013100%) to the bottle of Buffer AW1 and AW2. Mix reconstituted buffer by shaking.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Adjust all buffers to room temperature; deparaffinization solution to 20\u201325\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Buffer ATE used for elution in the QIAamp DSP DNA FFPE Tissue Kit contains the preservative sodium azide. Sodium azide absorbs at 260 nm and therefore a blank measurement with Buffer ATE should be performed to calibrate the spectrophotometer for absorbance readings at 260 nm. If using a QIAxpert photospectrometer, by using the QIAamp plug-in, an internal ATE-blank spectrum is automatically subtracted, so no additional blank ATE sample is required with this configuration.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Since gDNA derived from FFPE material is strongly degraded, use of total nucleic acids concentration \\(calculation formula: A260 = 1 = 50 \u00b5g/ml) readout is recommended for input calculation of DNA into the bisulfite conversion \\(recommended 400 ng, with an input range between 200 and 1,000 ng).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nEpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit\r\n\n\n\u2022 Bisulfite Solution can be stored at room temperature \\(15\u201325 \u00b0C) for at least 6 months.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: Buffer BD, Epitect spin columns and DNA protection buffer are stored at +2 to +8\u00b0C until use.\r\n\n\n\u2022 No carrier RNA will be used. The minimum amount of gDNA is always higher than 100 ng \\(200 \u2013 1000 ng).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add molecular grade ethanol \\(96\u2013100%) to the bottle of Buffer BW and Buffer BD according to the Kit manual instruction. Mix reconstituted Buffer by gentle shaking.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Adjust samples and buffers to room temperature.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Genomic DNA \\(gDNA) should be used for bisulfite treatment without any previous restriction digest step.\r\n\n\n\u2022 After thermal processing of bisulfite conversion in a thermocycler, samples can be stored at room temperature overnight. Exposure to light should be avoided to prevent light-induced degradation of DNA in bisulfite-containing buffers.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: DNA Protect Buffer should turn from green to blue after addition to the DNA-Bisulfite Solution mixture \\(see procedure step 38), indicating sufficient mixing and correct pH for the bisulfite conversion reaction, incorrect pH could impact the fixation of the converted DNA to the column.\r\n\n\n\u2022 White precipitates may form in the Buffer BD-ethanol mix after extended storage time. These precipitates will not affect the performance of Buffer BD. However, avoid transferring precipitates to the MinElute DNA spin column.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Perform all centrifugation steps at room temperature \\(15-25\u00b0C).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\ntherascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit:\r\n\n\n\u2022 Thaw all therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR components and samples in a refrigerator, on ice, on a cooling block or at room temperature, only as long as necessary. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Clean the bench area that is dedicated for the PCR mix preparation to reduce the risk of template or nuclease contamination.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: If thawed at room temperature, check regularly whether the material has thawed, especially the PITX2 RGQ PCR Master Mix \\(MMx) as it contains dNTPs that are sensitive to room temperature.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: PITX2 RGQ PCR PPM should be protected from light as it contains dye nucleotides. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: Repeated thawing and freezing should be avoided and should not exceed a maximum of four freeze\u2013thaw cycles. In the case of multiple test runs on one day, kit constituents can be stored for up to 6 hrs on ice without the need of re-freezing.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Prepare all reactions \\(reaction mix plus sample) on ice or in a cooling block.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: Do not use expired or incorrectly stored components.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: Do not use reaction volumes \\(reaction mix plus sample) of less or more than 20 \u00b5l.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Use individual, dedicated pipets for setting up the reaction mix and adding templates.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: Use extreme caution to prevent contamination of the reaction mix with the materials that are contained in the PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference 50 and PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference Low Control reagents.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: Use extreme caution to prevent DNA or PCR product carryover contamination resulting in a false-positive signal.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Critical: Use extreme caution to prevent contamination by DNase, which may cause degradation of the template DNA."

Timing refers to the simultaneous processing of 24 samples.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Pre-heat a thermomixer or heated orbital incubator to 56 \u00b0C. If a thermomixer or heated orbital incubator is not available, a heating block or water bath can be used instead. \r\n  2. Using a scalpel, trim excess paraffin off the sample block.\r\n  3. Cut one to two sections \\(5 \u00b5m thick) from a histologically confirmed tumor tissue block to reach at least 100 mm\u00b2 tumor surface. Troubleshooting. Critical step: if the sample surface has been exposed to air, discard the first 2-3 sections. \r\n  4. Immediately place the sections in a 1.5 or 2 ml microcentrifuge tube.\r\n  5. FFPE section deparaffinization can be performed using A) Deparaffinization Solution \\(see steps 6 to 16), or B) xylene-ethanol, or histolemon-ethanol \\(see steps 17 to 26).\r\n  \r\n\n\nA) Deparaffinization using deparaffinization solution\r\n\n\nTiming: 154 min or overnight.\r\n\n\n6. Add 160 \u00b5l Deparaffinization Solution \\(Caution: Irritating) and vortex vigorously for 10 seconds.\r\n  7. Centrifuge briefly to collect the sample in the bottom of the tube.\r\n  8. Incubate at 56\u00b0C for 3 min, then allow to adjust to room temperature \\(15\u201325\u00b0C).\r\n  9. Add 180 \u00b5l Buffer ATL \\(Caution: Irritating) and mix by vortexing.\r\n  10.

Centrifuge at full speed for 2 mins \u00b1 30 seconds at room temperature.\r\n  18. Remove the supernatant by pipetting. Do not remove any of the pellet.\r\n  19. Add 1 ml ethanol \\(96\u2013100%) to the pellet, and mix by vortexing. The ethanol extracts residual xylene from the sample.\r\n  20. Centrifuge at full speed for 2 mins \u00b1 30 seconds at room temperature.\r\n  21. Remove the supernatant by pipetting. Do not remove any of the pellet.\r\n  22.

Incubate for 10 min \u00b1 1 min or until all residual ethanol has evaporated.\r\n  24. Re-suspend the pellet in 180 \u00b5l Buffer ATL. Add 20 \u00b5l proteinase K, and mix by vortexing. Incubate at 56\u00b0C \u00b1 3\u00b0C for \u22651 hr \\(or until the sample has been completely lysed). \r\n   Pause Point: incubation can also take place overnight.\r\n\n\n25.

The incubation at 90\u00b0C in Buffer ATL partially reverses formaldehyde modification of nucleic acids. Longer incubation times or higher incubation temperatures may result in more fragmented DNA.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n26. Briefly centrifuge the 1.5 ml tube to remove drops from the inside lid. \r\n  \r\n\n\nClean-up of proteinase K digestion sample\r\n\n\nTiming: 75 min.\r\n\n\n27. Add 200 \u00b5l Buffer AL \\(Caution: Harmful) to the sample and mix thoroughly by vortexing. Then, add 200 \u00b5l ethanol \\(96\u2013100%), and mix again thoroughly by vortexing. Critical step: it is essential that the sample, Buffer AL, and ethanol are mixed immediately and thoroughly by vortexing or pipetting to yield a homogeneous solution. Buffer AL and ethanol can be premixed and added together in one step to save time when processing multiple samples. A white precipitate may form by addition of Buffer AL and ethanol. This precipitate does not interfere with the QIAamp procedure.\r\n  28. Briefly centrifuge the tube to remove drops from the inside of the lid.\r\n  29. Critical step: carefully transfer the entire lysate to the QIAamp MinElute\u00ae column \\(in a 2 ml collection tube) without wetting the rim, close the lid, and centrifuge at approximately 6000 x g for \u2265 1 min. Place the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 2 ml collection tube, and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through. If the lysate has not completely passed through the membrane after centrifugation, centrifuge again at a higher speed until the QIAamp MinElute column is empty.\r\n  30. Carefully open the QIAamp MinElute column and add 500 \u00b5l Buffer AW1 \\(Caution: harmful) without wetting the rim. Close the lid and centrifuge at approximately 6,000 x g for \u22651 min. Place the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 2 ml collection tube, and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through.\r\n  31. Carefully open the QIAamp MinElute column and add 500 \u00b5l Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim. Close the lid and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for ~1 min. Place the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 2 ml collection tube and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through. Contact between the QIAamp MinElute column and the flow-through should be avoided. Some centrifuge rotors may vibrate upon deceleration, resulting in the flow-through, which contains ethanol, coming into contact with the QIAamp MinElute column. Take care when removing the QIAamp MinElute column and collection tube from the rotor, so that flow-through does not come into contact with the QIAamp MinElute column.\r\n  32. Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for ~3 min to dry the membrane completely. This step is necessary, since ethanol carryover into the eluate may inhibit the qPCR reactions performed.\r\n  33. Place the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through. Carefully open the lid of the QIAamp MinElute column and apply 50 \u00b5l Buffer ATE to the center of the membrane.\r\n  34. Close the lid and incubate at room temperature \\(15\u201325\u00b0C) for 5 mins. Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for \u22651 min. \r\n  \r\n\n\nDNA concentration determination\r\n\n\nTiming: 25 min.\r\n\n\n35. The concentration of DNA is determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm following the instrument procedure using QIAGEN\u2019s QIAxpert, for example \\(QIAamp plug-in: total nucleic acid measurement) or a NanoDrop instrument. Absorbance readings at 260 nm should fall between 0.1 and 1.0 to be accurate. An absorbance of 1 unit at 260 nm corresponds to 50 \u00b5g of DNA per ml \\(A260 = 1 = 50 \u00b5g/ml). The total amount of DNA purified \\(ng) = concentration of DNA \\(ng/\u00b5l) x volume of sample \\(\u00b5l). Note: if using the QIAamp plug-in, an internal ATE-blank spectrum is automatically subtracted from the OD values, so no additional blank ATE sample is required with this configuration. Ideally, a minimal gDNA concentration is 10 ng/\u00b5l but samples as low as 5 ng/\u00b5l may be processed with risk of \u201cLow input\u201d invalid results. Pause point: DNA samples can be stored at -20\u00b0C until further use.\r\n  \r\n\n\nBisulfite conversion and bisDNA \\(bisulfite converted DNA) cleanup\r\n\n\nTiming: 232 min.\r\n\n\n36. Thaw DNA to be used in the bisulfite-conversion reactions. Make sure the Bisulfite Solution \\(Caution: irritant) is completely dissolved. Critical step: do not place dissolved Bisulfite Solution on ice. \r\n  37. Prepare the bisulfite reactions in 200 \u00b5l PCR tubes \\(not provided). Add each component in the order listed in \"Table 5\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6423/original/Table5.pdf?1518707899.\r\n  \r\n\n\nNote: The combined volume of DNA and RNase-free water must total 40 \u00b5l. \r\n\n\nTo determine the appropriate volume for the gDNA input of interest use the following formula: \r\n\n\ngDNA volume required for a bisulfite conversion \\(\u00b5l) = Input of interest \\(ng)/Average gDNA concentration \\(ng/\u00b5l). Critical step: when using the therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit, the \u201cLow concentration\u201d protocol from the EpiTect Fast Bisulfite Conversion Handbook must always be used, even with 1,000 ng input, as the concentration of gDNA purified from FFPE samples is usually low.\r\n\n\nCritical step: the bisulfite mix should be immediately vortexed for 5 sec after adding the DNA Protect Buffer \\(caution: reproductive toxicity, irritant) to protect samples from degradation. Troubleshooting.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n38. Close the PCR tubes and mix immediately the bisulfite reactions thoroughly. Store the tubes at room temperature \\(15\u201325\u00b0C). \r\n   Critical step: DNA Protect Buffer should turn from green to blue after addition to the DNA-Bisulfite Solution mixture, indicating sufficient mixing and correct pH for the bisulfite conversion reaction, or DNA binding to the MinElute DNA spin column. Troubleshooting.\r\n\n\n39. Perform the bisulfite DNA conversion using a thermal cycler. Program the thermal cycler according to \"Table 6\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6425/original/Table6.pdf?1518707922. The complete cycle should take ~30 min. If using a thermal cycler that does not allow to enter the reaction volume \\(140 \u00b5l), set the instrument to the largest volume setting available.\r\n  \r\n\n\n40. Place the PCR tubes containing the bisulfite reactions into the thermal cycler. Start the thermal cycling incubation. Critical step: because the bisulfite reaction is not overlaid with mineral oil, only thermal cyclers with heated lids are suitable for this procedure. It is important to use PCR tubes that close tightly. Pause Point: converted DNA can be left in the thermal cycler overnight without any loss of qPCR assay performance.\r\n  41. Briefly centrifuge the PCR tubes containing the bisulfite reactions. Then transfer the complete bisulfite reactions to clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. \r\n  42. Add 310 \u00b5l Buffer BL \\(Caution: harmful) to each sample. Mix the solution by vortexing and then centrifuge briefly.\r\n  43. Add 250 \u00b5l ethanol \\(96\u2013100 %) to each sample. Mix the solutions by pulse vortexing for 15 sec and centrifuge briefly to remove the drops from inside the lid.\r\n  44. Transfer the entire mixture from each tube into the corresponding MinElute DNA spin column.\r\n  45. Centrifuge the spin columns at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through, and place the spin columns back into the collection tubes.\r\n  46. Add 500 \u00b5l Buffer BW \\(wash buffer) to each spin column, and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through, and place the spin columns back into the collection tubes.\r\n  47. Add 500 \u00b5l Buffer BD \\(desulfonation buffer) to each spin column, and incubate for 15 min at room temperature \\(15\u201325\u00b0C). \\(Caution: corrosive) If there are precipitates in Buffer BD, avoid transferring them to the spin columns. Critical step: the bottle containing Buffer BD should be closed immediately after use to avoid acidification from carbon dioxide in the air. Note: it is important to close the lids of the spin columns before incubation. Troubleshooting\r\n  48. Centrifuge the spin columns at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through, and place the spin columns back into the collection tubes.\r\n  49. Add 500 \u00b5l Buffer BW to each spin column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the spin columns back into the collection tubes.\r\n  50 Add 500 \u00b5l Buffer BW a second time to each spin column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the spin columns back into the collection tube.\r\n\n\n51 Add 250 \u00b5l ethanol \\(96\u2013100%) to each spin column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min.\r\n\n\n52 Place the spin columns into new 2 ml collection tubes, and centrifuge the spin columns at maximum speed for 1 min to remove any residual liquid.\r\n\n\n53 Place the spin columns with open lids into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube \\(not provided) and incubate the columns for 5 min at 60\u00b0C in a heating block. Critical step: this step ensures the evaporation of any remaining liquid.\r\n\n\n54 Add 15 \u00b5l Buffer EB \\(elution buffer) directly onto the center of each spin-column membrane and close the lids gently. Critical step: do not elute with less than 15 \u00b5l buffer as the eluate volume would be too small to proceed with the qPCR step. \r\n\n\n55 Incubate the spin columns at room temperature for 1 min.\r\n\n\n56 Centrifuge for 1 min at 15,000 x g \\(12,000 rpm) to elute the DNA. Pause point: we recommend storing purified DNA at 2\u20138\u00b0C for up to 24 hr. When storing purified DNA for longer than 24 hr, we recommend storage at \u201330 to \u201315\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nqPCR set up, run and analysis\r\n\n\nTiming: 105 min.\r\n\n\nThe therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit must be run on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx 5plex HRM instrument using automated interpretation of results with Rotor-Gene AssayManager v2.1. Take time to familiarize yourself with the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument and with the Rotor-Gene AssayManager v2.1 software before starting the protocol. See the respective user manuals for the instrument, Rotor-Gene AssayManager v2.1, and the Gamma Plug-in for details.\r\n\n\n57. Cool a Loading Block 72 x 0.1 ml tubes for 10 min in a deep-freezer or for at least 1 hr at refrigerator temperature.\r\n  58. Thaw all therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit components and samples in a refrigerator, on ice, on a cooling block or at room temperature for as long as necessary. \r\n  59. Place the thawed products on ice, on a cooling block or in the refrigerator until placing them back into \u201330 to \u201315\u00b0C after use. Note: therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit components can be kept at 2\u20138\u00b0C and protected from light for maximum of 6 hr if used several times the same day.\r\n  60. Vortex the tubes \\(10\u201312 sec), then centrifuge them briefly before use. Except PITX2 RGQ PCR MMx, which is mixed by pipetting up and down as it contains Taq Polymerase.\r\n  61. Prepare PITX2 qPCR reaction mix on ice \\(or using a cooling block) in a 1.5 or 2 ml tube according to the number of samples to be processed.\r\n  \r\n\n\nThe pipetting scheme for the preparation of the PITX2 reaction mix, shown in \"Table 7\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6427/original/Table7.pdf?1518707942, is calculated to achieve final reaction volumes of 20 \u00b5l after addition of 4 \u00b5l bisDNA sample or control. Extra volume is included to compensate for pipetting errors and to allow preparation of sufficient reaction mix for four samples tested in duplicate, plus four controls. If less samples are tested, the reaction mix can be prepared accordingly. Remember to allow for the extra volume to compensate for pipetting errors \\(one extra well for up to 10 wells and two extra wells for up to 20 wells). Troubleshooting.\r\n\n\n62 Vortex \\(10\u201312 sec) and briefly centrifuge the PITX2 qPCR reaction mix. Place the qPCR strip tubes on a pre-cooled Loading Block 72 and dispense 16 \u00b5l of the PITX2 qPCR reaction mix per strip tube following the example of loading block setup shown in \"Figure 3\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6429/original/Figure3.pdf?1518707963.\r\n\n\nThe numbers denote positions in the loading block and indicate final rotor position. The positions of the controls are set in the PITX2 assay profile and cannot be changed. If controls are not placed as indicated, the automated result analysis cannot be performed. REF50: PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference 50; REFlow: PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference Low; NC: PITX2 RGQ PCR Negative Control, NTC: PITX2 RGQ PCR NTC \\(NTC); Sample 1 to 4: bisDNA samples, NA: empty well. Troubleshooting.\r\n\n\n63 Vortex \\(10\u201312 seconds) and briefly centrifuge bisDNA samples, PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference 50 \\(Ref50), PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference Low \\(RefLow), PITX2 RGQ PCR Negative Control \\(NC) and PITX2 RGQ PCR NTC \\(NTC). Troubleshooting.\r\n\n\n64 Add 4 \u00b5l sample or control material into its corresponding tube according to the setup in Figure 4 to obtain a total volume of 20 \u00b5l. Mix gently 5 times by pipetting up and down. Note: be careful to change tips between each tube to avoid false-positive results from contamination by any nonspecific template. Troubleshooting.\r\n\n\n65 Close all tubes and check that no bubbles are present at the bottom of the tubes. Troubleshooting.\r\n\n\n66 Return all the therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit components and samples to the appropriate storage conditions to avoid any material degradation. Pause point: it is highly recommended to start the run as soon as possible after the preparation, however, if the tubes are prepared but cannot be processed directly \\(due to instrument unavailability), it is possible to store the plate at 2\u20138\u00b0C and protected from light up to 24 hrs. Troubleshooting.\r\n\n\n67 Place a 72-Well Rotor on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx rotor holder.\r\n\n\n68 Fill the rotor with strip tubes previously prepared according to the assigned positions, starting at position 1. Critical step: make sure the first tube is inserted into position 1 and the strip tubes are placed in the correct orientation and positions \\(important for run validity and traceability of sample). Always keep the four controls \\(REF50, REFlow, NC and NTC) in positions 1 to 4 so that gain optimization \\(performed on tube position 1) is always performed on the same control sample. Make sure controls are loaded in the correct order for the automated analysis of the controls \\(an inversion of controls will invalidate the run by the PITX2 assay profile). Troubleshooting.\r\n\n\n69 Fill empty positions with empty, closed tubes to fill the rotor entirely.\r\n\n\n70 Attach the locking ring. \r\n\n\n71 Load the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument with the rotor and locking ring.

            "content": "Analysis of the therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit results for each control and sample is performed automatically by the Rotor-Gene AssayManager v2.1 associated with the Gamma Plug-in v1.0 and the PITX2 assay profile hereafter referred to as the PITX2 Assay Package. The PITX2 Assay Package analyzes amplification curves, and may invalidate non-conforming curves, depending on their shape and noise amplitude. If this is the case, a flag will appear with the invalidated curve. Cycle threshold values \\(CT) are determined automatically for each marker separately by the software. \r\n\n\nPMR values for each well are calculated separately using a modified 2exp\uf044CT method with the following formula: PMR \\(sample):  1/\\(1+2exp\\(CTmeth\\(FAM) \u2013 CTunmeth \\(HEX))) \\(see also patent EP1561821 10). A mean value is determined \\(PMRmean) and the difference for the PMRs from technical duplicates of a sample is calculated for quality control of intra-assay variation \\(deltaPMR; see \"Table 9\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6453/original/Table9.pdf?1518708290). To determine assay validity, the PITX2 Assay Package also analyzes the run controls, i.e., PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference 50 \\(REF50), PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference Low \\(REFlow), PITX2 RGQ PCR Negative Control \\(NC) and PITX2 RGQ PCR NTC \\(NTC). Validity for each control and sample is based on compliance of CT and/or PMR values with pre-defined specifications \\(see \"Table 10\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6455/original/Table10.pdf?1518708317).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote: If at least one control is invalid, the results obtained for all test samples are considered invalid and no PMR results are displayed. Finally, an integer PMR value is assigned to the samples by averaging of the two PMR results obtained for each sample replicate. In case of invalid results, retests are required. If the assay is invalid, i.e., one of the four controls invalid, the entire run including all tested samples should be retested. If the assay is valid but one or several samples are invalid, the invalid sample\\(s) should be retested after investigating the type of failure. A workflow of the retest procedure is presented in \"Figure 13\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6457/original/Figure13.jpg?1518708338\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWorkflow Control: \r\n\n\nThe sample HD216 \\(workflow control) should give a PMR value between 30 and 50. If this PMR is obtained with this workflow control, both gDNA purification and bisulfite conversion step can be validated. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nApplication example:\r\n\n\nThe PMR obtained for each patient sample will provide information to the treating physician about whether a patient is likely to benefit of anthracycline-based chemotherapy. If the PMR obtained is equal to or lower than 12, the patient is likely to benefit of anthracycline-based chemotherapy. In contrast, if the obtained PMR is higher than 12, an alternative treatment may be proposed, because the patient has a lower probability of responding to anthracycline-based chemotherapy.\r\n\n\nA retrospective validation study performed recently showed for 205 high-risk, lymph node positive, estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients, treated with adjuvant anthracycline-based therapy, included from three different hospitals an overall pass rate of 98 % \\(205 samples successfully analyzable) and a first time pass rate of 93 % \\(for 14 samples qPCR repeats in 205 valid samples were necessary) which demonstrates high robustness and reliability of the overall extraction and analysis workflow."

The test uses bisulfite-converted genomic DNA derived from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues of breast cancer patients. The PMR will aid clinicians in selecting adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, e.g. anthracycline-based chemotherapy in high-risk lymph node-positive, estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients. The assay is intended to be used by qualified users, such as technicians, molecular biologists/clinical chemists, or physicians, trained in molecular biology techniques and in vitro diagnostic procedures. The complete workflow is streamlined for medium sample throughput with highly reliable and robust readout and can be performed in two working days.",
