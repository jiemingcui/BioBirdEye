            "content": "A widely accepted method for _in situ_ polyphosphate \\(polyP) detection is fluorescence microscopy using a fluorochrome, 4\u2019, 6 - diamino-2-phenylindole 2HCl \\(DAPI) at high concentrations ranging from 3- 50 \u00b5g/ ml<sup>1</sup>. Interaction of polyP with DAPI shifts the emission maxima of the dye from 456 nm emitting blue fluorescence to 526 nm emitting bright yellow- green fluorescence<sup>2</sup>. The present protocol modifies the existing method of cell preparation by using Mcllvaine\u2019s buffer<sup>3</sup> instead of PBS buffer<sup>4, 5</sup> for more efficient microscopic detection of the polyP granules in cyanobacteria and microalgae _in vivo_. The use of PBS buffer greatly reduces the contrast and resolution during confocal microscopy as compared to Mcllvaine\u2019s buffer. It was also observed that the application of the dye to the specimen at concentrations greater than 25 \u00b5g/ ml resulted in only blue light emission making the detection of polyP impossible."
