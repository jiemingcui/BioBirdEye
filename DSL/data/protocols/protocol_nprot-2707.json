            "content": "T follicular helper \\(Tfh) cells represent the prototypical CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper \\(Th) cell subset that coordinates humoral immune responses through the induction and regulation of the germinal center \\(GC) response<sup>1</sup>. In GCs, affinity maturation and class-switch recombination of antigen-specific B cells lead to the production of high-affinity antibodies and the generation of memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells<sup>2</sup>. Tfh cell differentiation begins very early during an adaptive immune response<sup>3</sup>. Na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which reside in the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and spleen, become activated by antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Activated Th cells upregulate the transcription factor BCL6 \\(Ref. 4), a transcriptional repressor that is necessary and sufficient for Tfh cell differentiation in vivo<sup>5-7</sup>. Increased expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR5 \\(Ref. 8), together with downmodulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 \\(Ref. 9), then allows activated T cells to localize in close proximity of antigen-specifc B cells. At this stage, some activated B cells and CXCR5<sup>+</sup>BCL6<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh cells re-enter the follicle to establish GCs. Tfh cells further mature in these organized anatomical structures, as evidenced by a further increase in PD-1 and CXCR5 expression<sup>9,10</sup>. Continued interactions between GC B cells and Tfh cells are then required for the maintenance of Tfh cells<sup>11,12</sup>.\r\n\n\nInterestingly, Tfh cells and Tfh-like transition states have been shown to occur during the development of other Th cell subsets, particularly Th1 cells<sup>13,14</sup> and memory Th cells<sup>15-20</sup>.  Although CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> T cells are abundant in human blood, it remains unclear if these cells are true Tfh cells or if they represent activated effector T cells or memory T cells<sup>21</sup>. Tfh cell dysregulation can result in autoimmunity, and increased numbers of Tfh cells have been observed in several human autoimmune diseases<sup>22-24</sup>. Moreover, Tfh cells have been implicated as a major reservoir for HIV<sup>25-27</sup> and infected patients exhibit impaired Tfh cell and B cell responses<sup>28</sup>.\r\n\n\nHere we provide a simple and reliable staining protocol for the identification of murine Tfh cells by flow cytometry \\(**Figure 1**). A variety of protein markers have been used to characterize Tfh cells, including ICOS, IL-21, and SLAM family members. However, a consensus view has emerged supporting the definition of Tfh cells as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that express CXCR5 together with high levels of PD-1 and BCL6. Because of the limitations of available high-quality antibodies for staining of CXCR5 and BCL6 for flow cytometry and the importance of distinguishing cells with particularly high levels of CXCR5, PD-1 and BCL6, optimized staining protocols are important for clear identification of Tfh cells. Using this protocol, viable CXCR5<sup>hi</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup> Tfh cells can be easily stained within one hour. These cells can be analyzed or sorted by flow cytometry for downstream applications such as qPCR, microarray, or adoptive transfer experiments. Inclusion of BCL6 in the staining panel requires fixation and permeabilization of the cells and takes an additional 75 minutes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2611/original/Figure1.jpg?1371494439\">\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Figure 1: Workflow for the identification of Tfh cells by flow cytometry.**"

Currently available directly fluorophore-conjugated anti-CXCR5 antibodies do not provide staining bright enough to clearly distinguish Tfh cells from CXCR5<sup>\u2013</sup> T cells. It is also important to use a bright fluorophore conjugated to streptavidin, such as APC.

It is also critical to exclude cell:cell conjugates \\(\u201cdoublets\u201d), since conjugates of CXCR5<sup>+</sup> B cells bound to PD-1<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>\u2013</sup> T cells otherwise appear similar to Tfh cells. Non-CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can be excluded by additional staining  for non-CD4<sup>+</sup> cell markers, e.g. B220 or CD19 for B cells. It is also helpful to include a control tissue that should contain only very few Tfh cells, such as a peripheral lymph node from an unimmunized mouse."

            "content": "While CXCR5<sup>hi</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup> cells generally account for less than 0.5% of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in LNs or spleens of non-immunized mice, frequencies of Tfh cells among polyclonal or TCR-transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can vary to great extent following immunization or infection. Factors that influence the magnitude of the Tfh cell response include the precursor frequency and affinity of antigen-specific cells, the dose of the antigen, the adjuvant context, the route of immunization, and the time of the analysis. **Figure 2a** depicts polyclonal CXCR5<sup>hi</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup> Tfh cells in the draining and non-draining lymph nodes \\(LNs) after immunization. To more reliably identify significant changes in the frequencies of Tfh cells in weak immune responses, one option is to include a stain for CD44 and analyze CXCR5 and PD-1 expression only on activated CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. \r\n\n\nAdoptive cell transfer experiments utilizing TCR-transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which carry TCRs specific for a defined model antigen, are widely used to study Tfh cell differentiation and function in vivo.  Examples of mice with MHC class II-restricted TCR-transgenes include OT-II mice<sup>29</sup> and DO11.10 mice<sup>30</sup> \\(both specific for OVA<sub>323-339</sub>) and SMARTA mice<sup>31</sup> \\(specific for LCMV GP<sub>61-80</sub>). The use of different congenic markers \\(e.g. CD45.1 vs. CD45.2 or Thy1.1 vs. Thy1.2) allows for the identification of adoptively transferred donor T cells within the host \\(**Figure 2b**). The described protocol for intracellular BCL6 staining can be easily combined with other transcription factor stains. For example, LCMV infection generates predominantly two different Th cell populations: CXCR5<sup>\u2013</sup>T-bet<sup>hi</sup> Th1 cells and CXCR5<sup>hi</sup>BCL6<sup>hi</sup> Tfh cells \\(**Figure 2c**). In contrast, T follicular regulatory \\(Tfr) cells<sup>32,33</sup> are characterized by the expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 and combinations of classical Tfh cell markers, such as CXCR5 and PD-1 \\(**Figure 2d**). This protocol is also compatible with MHC class II-tetramer staining to quantify antigen-specific Tfh cells among endogenous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2612/original/Figure2.jpg?1371494441\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Figure 2: Identification of Tfh cells by flow cytometry.**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**a)** Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were immunized with 5\u00b5g NP<sub>29</sub>-KLH + 2\u00b5g LPS into the hind foot pads and draining popliteal and non-draining axillary LNs were analyzed by flow cytometry on day 6 after immunization.

Recently, Tfh cells and Tfh-like transition states have also been implicated in the generation of other Th cell subsets, including Th1 and memory Th cells. Tfh cells are generally characterized by their expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR5, the transcription factor BCL6, and the inhibitory molecule PD-1. Here we provide a simple and reliable optimized staining protocol for the identification of murine Tfh cells by flow cytometry. Stained cells can be analyzed directly by flow cytometry. Tfh cell sorting for use in downstream applications is also possible using CXCR5 and PD-1 staining, but intracellular staining for BCL6 is not compatible with live cell recovery.",
