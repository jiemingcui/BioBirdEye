            "content": "Large-scale bacterial expression and protein purification.\n1. For expression of 6xHis-tagged proteins encoded on pET15b or pET29b(+) vectors in Lemo21(DE3)\nE. coli\n, either a single colony from an agar plate, 25.0 \u03bcL of overnight-grown culture, or 25.0 \u03bcL of a 20% glycerol culture stock is inoculated into 50.0 mL, 500 mL, or 1.00 L of lysogeny broth (LB) media or Terrific Broth II (TBII) media supplemented with 50.0 \u03bcg\u00b7mL\n-1\ncarbenicillin (pET15b) or 50.0-100.0 \u03bcg\u00b7mL\n-1\nkanamycin (pET29b(+)) at final concentration.\n2. To induce protein expression, cells are grown at 37\u00b0C shaking at 200-250 rotations per minute (rpm) overnight (16-22 hours) with 500 \u00b5M isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) final concentration added either prior to inoculation or 4 hours prior to harvesting cells.\n3. Cells are harvested by centrifugation at 3,000-4,000x\ng\nfor 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C.\n4. Cell pellets are resuspended in 20.0-30.0 mL of either lysis buffer #1 supplemented with 1.00 mg\u00b7mL\n-1\nphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and a small amount of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), lysis buffer #2, or lysis buffer #3.\n5. Cells are lysed via either sonication at 40-70% amplitude, FastPrep-96 at 1,600 rpm with glass beads, or cell disruption using a microfluidizer at 18,000 psi.\n6. Crude cell lysates are centrifuged at 24,000x\ng\nfor 30-60 minutes at 4\u02daC.\n7. To purify clarified cell lysates via gravity Ni-NTA immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), 2.00 mL of Ni-NTA agarose resin is pre-equilibrated with 10.0 mL of either lysis buffer #1, wash buffer #2, or wash buffer #3.\n8. Clarified cell lysate is loaded onto the column and the flow-through is collected.\n9. The column is washed 1-3 times with 20.0 mL of either wash buffer #1, wash buffer #2, or wash buffer #3.\n10. The proteins are eluted from the column in 5.00-15.0 mL of either elution buffer #1, elution buffer #2, or elution buffer #3 and the eluates are collected.\n11a. For keeping 6xHis tags intact, IMAC-purified proteins are buffer exchanged into high salt Tev cleavage buffer or low salt Tev cleavage buffer using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units. Proceed to step 14.\n11b. For removing 6xHis tags, IMAC-purified proteins are concentrated to ~1.0 mL using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units, 1.0-5.0 mg\u00b7mL\n-1\n6xHis-tagged Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV-6xHis) protease is added at a ~1:100 dilution, and the reaction is incubated at 25\u00b0C overnight. Proceed to step 12.\n12. TEV-6xHis protease is removed via secondary Ni-NTA IMAC purification, eluting proteins in 5.00 mL of lysis buffer #1 or lysis buffer #2.\n13. Cleaved protein is concentrated in Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units.\n14. Protein concentrations are measured using either a QuBit 2.0 and QuBit Protein Assay Kit or a NanoDrop 8000 with extinction coefficients predicted from amino acid sequence using the ProtParam tool\n2\nor Biopython module\n3\n.\nSize-exclusion chromatography (SEC).\n1. IMAC-purified proteins are prepared at \u22651 mg\u00b7mL\n-1\nand applied to a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column or Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column on a LC 1200 Series high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) machine for separation of IMAC-purified proteins based on molecular size.\n2. SEC-purified proteins are eluted in either high salt Tev cleavage buffer, Tris buffered saline (TBS), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline without calcium or magnesium (DPBS) (Thermo Scientific).\n3. Monomeric protein fractions are collected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units with 3 kDa cutoff.\n4. Protein concentrations are measured as in step 14 of \"Large-scale bacterial expression and protein purification.\"\nSmall-scale bacterial expression and protein purification.\n1. 25.0 \u03bcL of overnight-grown cultures of Lemo21(DE3)\nE. coli\nare inoculated into each well of Nunc 2.0 mL DeepWell 96-well plates containing 1.00 mL of LB media supplemented with 50.0 \u03bcg\u00b7mL\n-1\ncarbenicillin (pET15b) final concentration, and plates are sealed with adhesive Breathe-easy film covers. Optionally, 2-8 replicate plates are prepared to optimize purified protein yields.\n2. Cells are grown at 37\u00b0C and shaken at 1,200 rpm for 3-4 hours.\n3. 500 \u00b5M IPTG final concentration is added to each well.\n4. Protein expression is induced for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C shaken at 1,200 rpm.\n5. Cells are pelleted at 2,272x\ng\nfor 2-5 minutes in a plate centrifuge.\n6. Pellets are resuspended in 50.0 \u03bcL of lysis buffer #1 supplemented with 1.00 mg\u00b7mL\n-1\nPMSF and a small amount of DNase I, combining pellets of any replicate plates.\n7. Cells are transferred to skirted 96-well polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plates and sealed with adhesive foil covers for cell lysis via a microplate sonicator at 40-60% amplitude for 2-4 minutes in an ice bath.\n8. Crude cell lysates are centrifuged at 2,272x\ng\nfor 5 minutes in a plate centrifuge.\n9. Clarified cell lysates are applied to His MultiTrap HP 96-well plates pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer #1, and IMAC purification undergone following the manufacturer's protocol for purification except resin is washed three times in wash buffer #1 and eluted three times, each time using 50.0 \u03bcL of elution buffer #1.\n10. Eluates are consolidated into a single 96-well PCR plate."

The protocol can take less than 24 hours to complete, and allows for downstream <em>in vitro</em> characterization of photophysical properties of mFAPs by equilibration with exogenous fluorogenic compounds.</p>",
