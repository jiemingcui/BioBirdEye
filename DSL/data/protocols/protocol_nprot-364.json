            "content": "Post-mitotic neurons in the developing cortex migrate along radial glial fibers to the proper location in the cortical plate and form the layered structure. Here we report that the radial migration of rat layer II/III cortical neurons requires the guidance of an extracellular diffusible factor Semaphorin-3A \\(Sema3A). Sema3A is expressed in a descending gradient across the cortical layers, whereas its receptor neuropilin-1 \\(NP1) is expressed at a high level in migrating neurons. Using _in utero_ eletroporation to down-regulate or conditional knockout of NP1 in newborn cortical neurons impeded their radial migration by disrupting their radial orientation during migration without altering their cell fate. Studies in cultured cortical slices further showed the requirement of the endogenous gradient of Sema3A for the proper migration of newborn neurons. Finally, transwell chemotaxis assays showed that isolated newborn neurons were attracted by Sema3A. Thus, Sema3A may serve as a chemoattractive guidance signal for radial migration of newborn cortical neurons toward upper layers."

We also stain sections with 4\u2019, 6-diaminodino-2-phenylindole \\(DAPI; 1:5,000). \r\n  6. Acquire images on a Zeiss LSM 510 multiphoton confocal system using a multi-track configuration, or on a NIKON E600FN microscope, and process them using Adobe Photoshop CS. We measure the intensity of fluorescence using the software LSM Image Browser, normalize the expression level of NP1 in GFP-positive cells by the average value of ten nearby GFP-negative cells at different locations, and express it as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. We assess statistical significance \\(P < 0.01) using paired Student\u2019s t-test. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Peroxidase immunostaining**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1.

Isolate rat cDNA encoding genes of SEMA3A, NP1, PLEXIN A2, PLEXIN A4, or PLEXIN D1 by RT-PCR using cDNA primers as indicated in Table 2, and subclone them into a pBluescript KS \\(+/-) mammalian expression vector. \r\n  3. Prepare coronal cryostat sections of 20 \u03bcm. \r\n  4. Hybridize the sections with 1 \u03bcg/ml Digoxin-labeled sense or antisense probes for 16 hr at 65 \u00b0 C in hybridization solution \\(50 % formamide, 5 X SSC, 300 \u03bcg/ml yeast tRNA, 100 ng/ml Heparin, 1 mM EDTA, 1 X Denhardt's solution, 0.1 % Tween 20, 0.1 % CHAPS, 5 mM EDTA). \r\n  5.

Subsequently, wash the sections twice with 0.2 X SSC for 30 min at 65 \u00b0 C to remove any excess probe.\r\n  8. Incubate the sections with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-Digoxin antibody \\(Roche) at 4 \u00b0 C overnight.\r\n  9. Detect the hybridization signal with a detection solution \\(1 \u03bcl of NBT and 3.5 \u03bcl of BCIP in every ml of mixture of alkaline phosphatase buffer) in dark at room temperature overnight. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Slice culture** \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1.

Transfer slices to the surface of a transparent porous membrane \\(0.4 \u03bcm pore size, Millipore) in a 35 mm culture dish containing 1 ml medium \\(DMEM, 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 % B27, Gibico).\r\n  3. Incubate slices in the cell culture incubator for 1 hr to allow recovery from injury. \r\n  4. Then seal the culture dish with parafilm and transfer it to a heat stage \\(37 \u00b0 C) at the confocal microscope \\(Zeiss LSM 510). \r\n  5. For drug treatments, we pre-incubate slices with exogenous factors for at least 4 hr in the incubator before observation on the microscope.\r\n  6. Illuminate the tissue with a 488-nm wavelength light. Acquire the Z-series stacks of confocal fluorescence images using a 20 x lens every 15 min for 3 hr. \r\n  7. Reconstruct images by LSM Image Browser and trace images by the software Neurolucida. \r\n  8. Analyze the migration speed of EYFP-labeled neurons using the program Neuroexplorer and express it as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. We designate transfected neurons, of which the migration distance is less than 10 \u03bcm in the 3-hr imaging,  as stationary cells, and do not use them to calculate the migration speed. \r\n  9. For each experiment, we score a minimum of 200 cells from at least 5 sections, and assess statistical significance \\(P < 0.01) using Student\u2019s t-test. \r\n  10. We use the following reagents: anti-neuropilin-1 antibody \\(polyclonal, R&D, 10 \u03bcg/ml) and Sema3A \\(R&D, 1 \u03bcg/ml). \r\n  11. Fuse images to produce a movie at 2 frames/s by the program Quicktime player.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Cell migration assay**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1.

Obtainand the transfected cells from IZ at E20 \u2014 P0. \r\n  4. Assay the migration of dissociated transfected cells using a Boyden transwell system \\(5 \u03bcm pore size, Corning Costar Co., USA). \r\n  5. Before seeding, coat both sides of the transwell overnight with Poly-D-Lysine \\(30 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma). Add 750 \u03bcl of serum-free medium \\(Neurobasal medium, 2 % B27, Gibico) containing dissociated transfected cells \\(one fifth of one million cells per well) to the upper insert of a chamber. In the bottom chamber, add 250 \u03bcl of serum-free medium \\(Neurobasal medium, 2 % B27, Gibico) with or without any other reagents.\r\n  6. We use the following reagents: BDNF \\(Chemicon, 50 ng/ml), Semaphorin-3A \\(R&D, 1 \u03bcg/ml, 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, 0.1 \u03bcg/ml). \r\n  7. Change the medium 1 day after the seeding to maintain the reagent gradient. \r\n  8. Two days after seeding, fix cells with 4 % paraformaldehyde, and thoroughly scrap cells attached to the upper side of the membranes. Immunostain cells attached to the bottom side of the membranes with anti-GFP antibody by the method described above. \r\n  9. Analyze cells directly under the confocal microscope \\(Zeiss LSM 510). We repeat each experiment at least five times. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Morphometry and analysis**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Count the numbers of transfected cells in the slices using the software Image-Pro Plus 5.1.\r\n  2. For frozen sections, we count EYFP-labeled cortical neurons on brain sections across three different cortical zones \\(Layer II/III, Layer IV-VI, and VZ/SVZ/WM) at different developmental stages, and analyze the distribution of transfected cortical neurons. We count at least 10 sections \\(1 section per rat or mice) for each experiment. \r\n  3. For slice culture experiments, we count EYFP-expressing cells along the radial axis of cultured slices over ten equally divided zones from the presumptive VZ to the pial surface, and express them as the cumulative distribution of labeled cells along the radial axis of transfected slices. We count a minimum of 7 sections \\(1-2 sections per rat) for each experiment, and assess statistical significance \\(P < 0.01)  using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\r\n  4. For morphological analysis, we semi-automatically trace the Z-series stacks of confocal images using the software Neurolucida, and analyz the total length and branch number of each individual process in transfected neurons using the program Neuroexplorer. \r\n  5. For neurons in P3 cortices, we summate all segments of a process into a vector, and measure the angle between this vector and the neighboring radial glial fiber by Neuroexplorer.\r\n  6. For neurons in P7 cortices or co-cultured slices, we draw a line \\(OP) from the center of soma \\(O) perpendicular to pial surface \\(P) and designate it as the radial axis. Next, we construct a circle \\(radius of 50 \u03bcm) with center at O, and name the point where the circle crosses with the main dendrite as R \\(ref. 9). Then we measure the angle between OP and OR \\(\u2220POR) by LSM Image Browser and assesse statistical significance \\(P < 0.01) using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. \r\n  7. We carry out the Sholl analysis for dendritic complexity by counting the number of crossings of dendrites that cross a series of concentric circles at 10 \u03bcm intervals from the soma as described previously \\(ref. 10), and assess statistical significance \\(P < 0.01) using Student\u2019s t-test. \r\n  8. To analyze the morphology of transfected neurons, we score a minimum of 130 cells from at least 10 sections \\(1 section per rat) for each experiment."
