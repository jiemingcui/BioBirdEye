            "content": "<p>\tBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women with approximately 523,000 new cases per year in Europe<sup>1</sup> and 1.9 million incident cases worldwide and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women<sup>2</sup>. Prognostic factors provide information about the future course of the disease. Clinico-pathological risk factors for disease recurrence include axillary lymph node status, tumor size, histological grade, steroid hormone receptor status, vascular invasion, patient age, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-status<sup>3</sup>. According to clinico-pathological risk classification for early breast cancer about 25% of the patients are at high risk, 65% are at intermediate risk and 10% are at low risk for disease recurrence. Patients at high-risk include those with more than three lymph nodes affected (independent from additional risk factors) or patients with one to three affected lymph nodes plus additional risk factors. According to current understanding, the high-risk group also includes patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), i.e. patients with tumors negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression<sup>4</sup>. Patients at high risk for disease recurrence are recommended to receive anthracycline-based chemotherapy (ANT) according to international guidelines<sup>5</sup>. </p><p>\tTo identify patients at diagnosis whether they will benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy, a biomarker to predict response is of clinical need. DNA methylation patterns such as methylation status of the pituitary homeobox gene 2 (PITX2) play a key role in several cancer indications<sup>6-12</sup> including breast cancer<sup>13-17</sup> and published data of a Research Use Only (RUO) PITX2 DNA methylation assay using fresh-frozen tissue showed that PITX2 DNA methylation can be a predictive marker for response to adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in breast cancer<sup>18</sup>. The CE-marked <em>therascreen</em><sup><em>\u00ae</em></sup> PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit by QIAGEN was entering the market in 2018 as clinically validated biomarker test for breast cancer <sup>19-21</sup>. </p><p>\tThe CE-marked <em>therascreen</em><sup><em>\u00ae</em></sup> PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit is an optimized <em>in vitro</em> DNA methylation-specific quantitative real-time PCR test intended for the clinically reliable determination of the percent methylation ratio (PMR) in the pituitary homeobox 2 (PITX2) transcription factor gene promoter 2 in lymph node-positive, estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative high risk breast cancer patients. The clinical validity of the pre-defined PMR cut-off of 12 to predict patient outcome to anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without endocrine therapy was shown by using 145 patient samples with 10-year follow-up data and disease-free survival as the primary end point. PITX2 hypermethylation (PMR &gt; 12) indicates a poor outcome to ANT-based chemotherapy whereas PITX2 hypomethylation (PMR \u2264 12) indicates a good outcome to ANT-based chemotherapy<sup>20</sup>. The CE-marked <em>therascreen</em><sup><em>\u00ae</em></sup> PITX2 RGQ PCR assay is able to guide the clinician to select the appropriate chemotherapy regimen for high-risk BC patient group. The CE-marked <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 RGQ PCR assay uses bisulfite-converted genomic DNA (with a genomic DNA input range of 200 ng \u2013 1000&nbsp;ng with 400 ng as recommended input) derived from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues of these breast cancer patients. The FFPE tissue surface area of \u2265&nbsp;100&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> (1-2&nbsp;x&nbsp;5&nbsp;\u00b5m sections) is the recommended minimal tissue surface area for the standard <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 workflow<sup>19,22</sup>.</p><p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before tumor resection is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of high-risk breast cancer<sup>23-25</sup>. In these cases, tumor tissue specimens are limited to core biopsies or fine needle aspirates with tumor tissue surface areas below the minimal surface area of 100 mm<sup>2</sup> which are needed for the standard <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 workflow<sup>19</sup>. </p><p>The workflow protocol described here as \u201cCondensed Efficient Fast (CEF)\u201d PITX2 workflow combines DNA purification and bisulfite conversion in one step and allows to reduce the minimal tumor tissue surface area to 30&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> from 1-2&nbsp;x&nbsp;5&nbsp;\u00b5m FFPE sections (therefore routinely assessed core biopsies or fine needle aspirations may be used as tissue source) to determine the PITX2 PMR with a recommended bisDNA input of 6&nbsp;ng/\u00b5l. The new CEF PITX2 workflow introduces the EpiTect Fast FFPE Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen Cat.&nbsp;No./ID 59844) in the workflow, which consists of the EpiTect Fast FFPE Lysis Kit, containing specialized buffers for efficient deparaffinization and lysis of FFPE tissue slices and the EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit for fast and effective bisulfite conversion of the lysate. The DNA quality check is performed after the bisulfite-conversion of gDNA (bisDNA) by photospectrometric assessment (OD260 nm) with the QIAxpert photospectrometer using ssDNA QIAamp plug-in and buffer EB (QIAGEN) as blank control. The workflow steps using the <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 RGQ PCR assay to determine the PMR of PITX2 on the Rotor-Gene with automated data analysis and report using Rotor-Gene AssayManager v2.1 remain unchanged and identical outlined in the \u201cPMR Detection &amp; Analysis\u201d part (see Figure 1). For an overview of the CEF PITX2 workflow steps see Table 1.</p><p>The CEF PITX2 workflow offers scientists and clinicians a tool to conduct scientific research and translational research studies on PITX2 as biomarker in indications with small amounts of FFPE tumor tissues not only in breast cancer but also other cancer indications like head and neck cancer<sup>10</sup>, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma<sup>12</sup>, non-small cell lung cancer<sup>6</sup>, colorectal cancer<sup>8</sup>, ovarian cancer<sup>7</sup>, bladder cancer<sup>26</sup> and prostate cancer<sup>9,11</sup>.</p><p>The CEF PITX2 workflow is currently Research Use Only (RUO) and will be further evaluated in clinical research studies.</p><p>For overall workflow control, one vial containing one histological section (15 to 20 \u00b5m thick) of KRAS G13D Reference Standard section (Horizon Discovery, cat. no. HD216) can be used. qPCR controls comprise two positive controls (REF50, REFlow) and two negative controls (NC, NTC).</p>"

Make sure that all kit reagents are not used after their expiry date and<strong> </strong>have been transported and stored under the correct conditions. Tissue specimens should be fixed in 4\u201310% formalin (neutral buffered formalin is generally accepted) as quickly as possible after surgical removal of the biopsy. Ideally, use a fixation time of 14\u201324&nbsp;hrs (longer fixation times lead to more severe DNA fragmentation, resulting in poor performance in qPCR/qMSP assays). Thoroughly dehydrate samples prior to embedding (residual formalin can inhibit proteinase K digestion). Five \u00b5m thick sections must be cut from the paraffin block. All chemicals and biological materials are potentially hazardous. Specimens and samples are potentially infectious and must be treated as biohazardous materials.

Storage conditions are described in\nTable 2\n. Regarding safety precautions for specific kit components see\nTable 3\n. Timing as stated in the following procedure refers to the simultaneous processing of 24 samples.\n1.\nPre-heat a thermomixer or heated orbital incubator to 56\u00b0C. If a thermomixer or heated orbital incubator is not available, a heating block or water bath can be used instead.\n2.\nUsing a scalpel, trim excess paraffin off the sample block.\n3.\nCut one to two sections (5 \u00b5m thick) from a histologically confirmed tumor tissue. Troubleshooting. Critical step: if the sample surface has been exposed to air, discard the first 2-3 sections.\n4.\nImmediately place the sections in a 1.5 ml or 2 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nDeparaffinization using deparaffinization solution and PK-digestion of FFPE tissue.\nTiming: 100 min or overnight.\n5.\nAdd 320 \u00b5l Deparaffinization Solution (Caution: Irritating) and vortex vigorously for 10 seconds.\n6.\nAdd 20 \u00b5l distilled water, 15 \u00b5l Lysis Buffer FTB, and 5 \u00b5l proteinase K.(Caution: Irritating)\nNote: A Master Mix comprising distilled water, Lysis Buffer FTB, and proteinase K may be prepared in advance.\n7.\nVortex and briefly centrifuge to collect the sample in the bottom of the tube.\nNote: The Deparaffinization Solution will form a layer above the Lysis Buffer FTB with the addition of proteinase K.\n8.\nIncubate the tubes in a thermal block set to 56\u00b0C for 60 min up to overnight to lyse the tissues. Ensure that tissues are completely lysed (the solution will become homogeneous). Pause Point: incubation can also take place overnight.\n9.\nCritical step: Incubate at 90\u00b0C \u00b1 5\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hr \u00b1 5 min.\nNote: If using only one heating block, leave the sample at room temperature (15\u201325\u00b0C) after the 56\u00b0C incubation, until the heating block has reached 90\u00b0C.The incubation at 90\u00b0C partially reverses formaldehyde modification of nucleic acids. Longer incubation times or higher incubation temperatures may result in more fragmented DNA. Troubleshooting.\n10.\nBriefly centrifuge the 1.5 ml tube to remove drops from inside the lid.\n11.\nTransfer the complete lysate (about 40 \u00b5l, the lower clear phase) in a 200 \u00b5l reaction tube or 8-well strip (not provided). Avoid transfer of Deparaffinization Solution as much as possible.\nNote: Small amounts of remaining Deparaffinization Solution have no effect on the bisulfite reaction.\nBisulfite conversion of lysate and bisDNA (bisulfite converted DNA) cleanup\nTiming: 232 min.\nMake sure the Bisulfite Solution (Caution: irritant) is completely dissolved. Critical step: do not place dissolved Bisulfite Solution on ice.\n12.\nPrepare the bisulfite reactions in 200 \u00b5l PCR tubes (not provided). Add each component in the order listed in\nTable 5\n.\nNote:\nCritical step: when using the\ntherascreen\nPITX2 RGQ PCR Kit, the \u201cLow concentration\u201d protocol from the EpiTect Fast Bisulfite Conversion Handbook must always be used, as the concentration of gDNA purified from FFPE samples is usually low.\nCritical step: the bisulfite mix should be immediately vortexed for 5 sec after adding the DNA Protect Buffer (caution: reproductive toxicity, irritant) to protect samples from degradation. Troubleshooting.\n13.\nClose the PCR tubes and mix immediately the bisulfite reactions thoroughly. Store the tubes at room temperature (15\u201325\u00b0C).\nCritical step: DNA Protect Buffer should turn from green to blue after addition to the DNA-Bisulfite Solution mixture, indicating sufficient mixing and correct pH for the bisulfite conversion reaction, or DNA binding to the MinElute DNA spin column. Troubleshooting.\n14.\nPerform the bisulfite DNA conversion using a thermal cycler. Program the thermal cycler according to Table 6. The complete cycle should take ~30 min. If using a thermal cycler that does not allow to enter the reaction volume (140 \u00b5l), set the instrument to the largest volume setting available.\n15.\nPlace the PCR tubes containing the bisulfite reactions into the thermal cycler. Start the thermal cycling incubation.\nCritical step: as the bisulfite reaction is not overlaid with mineral oil, only thermal cyclers with heated lids are suitable for this procedure. It is important to use PCR tubes that close tightly.\nPause Point: converted DNA can be left in the thermal cycler overnight (at 20\u00b0C) without any loss of qPCR assay performance.\n16.\nBriefly centrifuge the PCR tubes containing the bisulfite reactions. Then transfer the complete bisulfite reactions to clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.\n17.\nAdd 310 \u00b5l Buffer BL (Caution: harmful) to each sample. Mix the solution by vortexing and then centrifuge briefly.\n18.\nAdd 250 \u00b5l ethanol (96\u2013100 %) to each sample. Mix the solutions by pulse vortexing for 15 sec and centrifuge briefly to remove the drops from inside the lid.\n19.\nTransfer the entire mixture from each tube into the corresponding MinElute DNA spin column.\n20.\nCentrifuge the spin columns at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the spin columns back into the collection tubes.\n21.\nAdd 500 \u00b5l Buffer BW (wash buffer) to each spin column, and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the spin columns back into the collection tubes.\n22.\nAdd 500 \u00b5l Buffer BD (desulfonation buffer) to each spin column and incubate for 15 min at room temperature (15\u201325\u00b0C). (Caution: corrosive) If there are precipitates in Buffer BD, avoid transferring them to the spin columns.\nCritical step: the bottle containing Buffer BD should be closed immediately after use to avoid acidification from carbon dioxide in the air.\nNote: it is important to close the lids of the spin columns before incubation. Troubleshooting.\n23.\nCentrifuge the spin columns at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the spin columns back into the collection tubes.\n24.\nAdd 500 \u00b5l Buffer BW to each spin column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the spin columns back into the collection tubes.\n25.\nAdd 500 \u00b5l Buffer BW a second time to each spin column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the spin columns back into the collection tube.\n26.\nAdd 250 \u00b5l ethanol (96\u2013100%) to each spin column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min.\n27.\nPlace the spin columns into new 2 ml collection tubes and centrifuge the spin columns at maximum speed for 1 min to remove any residual liquid.\n28.\nPlace the spin columns with open lids into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (not provided) and incubate the columns for 5 min at 60\u00b0C in a heating block.\nCritical step: this step ensures the evaporation of any remaining liquid.\n29.\nAdd 15 \u00b5l Buffer EB (elution buffer) directly onto the center of each spin-column membrane and close the lids gently.\nCritical step: do not elute with less than 15 \u00b5l buffer as the eluate volume would be too small to proceed with the qPCR step.\n30.\nIncubate the spin columns at room temperature for 1 min.\n31.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 15,000 x g (12,000 rpm) to elute the DNA.\nPause point: we recommend storing purified DNA at 2\u20138\u00b0C for up to 24 hrs. When storing purified DNA for longer than 24 hrs, we recommend storage at \u201330 to \u201315\u00b0C.\nDNA concentration determination -\nTiming: 25 min.\n32.\nThe concentration of DNA is determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm following the instrument procedure using QIAGEN\u2019s QIAxpert for example (ssDNA plugin: single stranded nucleic acid measurement) or a NanoDrop instrument. Absorbance readings at 260 nm should fall between 0.1 and 1.0 to be accurate. An absorbance of 1 unit at 260 nm corresponds to 33 \u00b5g of bisDNA per ml (A260 = 1 = 33 \u00b5g/ml). Note: if using the QIAxpert ssDNA plug-in, an EB-blank sample has to be included, which is after measurement automatically subtracted from the OD values. Ideally, the minimal gDNA concentration is 6 ng/\u00b5l but samples as low as 2 ng/\u00b5l may be processed with risk of \u201cLow input\u201d invalid results. Pause point: bisDNA samples can be stored at -20\u00b0C until further use.\nqPCR set up, run and analysis -\nTiming: 105 min.\nThe\ntherascreen\nPITX2 RGQ PCR Kit must be run on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx 5plex HRM instrument using automated interpretation of results with Rotor-Gene AssayManager v2.1. Take time to familiarize yourself with the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument and with the Rotor-Gene AssayManager v2.1 software before starting the protocol. See the respective user manuals for the instrument, Rotor-Gene AssayManager v2.1, and the Gamma Plug-in for details.\n33.\nCool a Loading Block 72 x 0.1 ml tubes for 10 min in a deep-freezer or for at least 1 hr at refrigerator temperature.\n34.\nThaw all\ntherascreen\nPITX2 RGQ PCR Kit components and samples in a refrigerator, on ice, on a cooling block or at room temperature for as long as necessary.\n35.\nPlace the thawed products on ice, on a cooling block or in the refrigerator until placing them back into \u201330 to \u201315\u00b0C after use.\nNote:\ntherascreen\nPITX2 RGQ PCR Kit components can be kept at 2\u20138\u00b0C and protected from light for a maximum of 6 hr if used several times the same day.\n36.\nVortex the tubes (10\u201312 sec), then centrifuge them briefly before use. Except PITX2 RGQ PCR MMx, which is mixed by pipetting up and down as it contains Taq Polymerase.\n37.\nPrepare PITX2 qPCR reaction mix on ice (or using a cooling block) in a 1.5 ml or 2 ml tube according to the number of samples to be processed.\nThe pipetting scheme for the preparation of the PITX2 reaction mix, shown in Table 7, is calculated to achieve final reaction volumes of 20 \u00b5l after addition of 4 \u00b5l bisDNA sample or control. Extra volume is included to compensate for pipetting errors and to allow preparation of sufficient reaction mix for four samples tested in duplicate, plus four controls. If less samples are tested, the reaction mix can be prepared accordingly. Remember to allow for the extra volume to compensate for pipetting errors (one extra well for up to 10 wells and two extra wells for up to 20 wells). Troubleshooting.\n38.\nVortex (10\u201312 sec) and briefly centrifuge the PITX2 qPCR reaction mix. Place the qPCR strip tubes on a pre-cooled Loading Block 72 and dispense 16 \u00b5l of the PITX2 qPCR reaction mix per strip tube following the example of loading block setup shown in Figure 2.\nThe numbers denote positions in the loading block and indicate final rotor position. The positions of the controls are set in the PITX2 assay profile and cannot be changed. If controls are not placed as indicated, the automated result analysis cannot be performed.

Troubleshooting.\n39.\nVortex (10\u201312 seconds) and briefly centrifuge bisDNA samples, PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference 50 (Ref50), PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference Low (REFlow), PITX2 RGQ PCR Negative Control (NC) and PITX2 RGQ PCR NTC (NTC). Troubleshooting.\n40.\nAdd 4 \u00b5l sample or control material into its corresponding tube according to the setup in Figure 2 to obtain a total volume of 20 \u00b5l. Mix gently 5 times by pipetting up and down. Note: be careful to change tips between each tube to avoid false-positive results from contamination by any nonspecific template. Troubleshooting.\n41.\nClose all tubes and check that no bubbles are present at the bottom of the tubes. Troubleshooting.\n42.\nReturn all the therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit components and samples to the appropriate storage conditions to avoid any material degradation. Pause point: it is highly recommended to start the run as soon as possible after the preparation, however, if the tubes are prepared but cannot be processed directly (e.g. due to instrument unavailability), it is possible to store the plate at 2\u20138\u00b0C and protected from light up to 24 hrs. Troubleshooting.\n43.\nPlace a 72-Well Rotor on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx rotor holder.\n44.\nFill the rotor with strip tubes previously prepared according to the assigned positions, starting at position 1. Critical step: make sure the first tube is inserted into position 1 and the strip tubes are placed in the correct orientation and positions (important for run validity and traceability of sample). Always keep the four controls (REF50, REFlow, NC and NTC) in positions 1 to 4 so that gain optimization (performed on tube position 1) is always performed on the same control sample. Make sure controls are loaded in the correct order for the automated analysis of the controls (an inversion of controls will invalidate the run by the PITX2 assay profile).

The PITX2 Assay Package analyzes amplification curves, and may invalidate non-conforming curves, depending on their shape and noise amplitude. If this is the case, a flag will appear with the invalidated curve. Cycle threshold values (CT) are determined automatically for each marker separately by the software. </p><p>PMR values for each well are calculated separately using a modified 2exp<sup>DCT</sup> method with the following formula: PMR (sample): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/(1+2exp(CT<sub>meth</sub>(FAM) \u2013 CT<sub>unmeth</sub> (HEX)))<sup>19</sup>. A mean value is determined (PMRmean) and the difference for the PMRs from technical duplicates of a sample is calculated for quality control of intra-assay variation (deltaPMR; see Table 9). To determine assay validity, the PITX2 Assay Package also analyzes the run controls, i.e., PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference 50 (REF50), PITX2 RGQ PCR Reference Low (REFlow), PITX2 RGQ PCR Negative Control (NC) and PITX2 RGQ PCR NTC (NTC). Validity for each control and sample is based on compliance of CT and/or PMR values with pre-defined specifications (see Table 10).</p><p>Note: If at least one control is invalid, the results obtained for all test samples are considered invalid and no PMR results are displayed. Finally, an integer PMR value is assigned to the samples by averaging of the two PMR results obtained for each sample replicate. In case of invalid results, retests are required. If the assay is invalid, i.e., one of the four controls invalid, the entire run including all tested samples should be retested. If the assay is valid but one or several samples are invalid, the invalid sample(s) should be retested after investigating the type of failure. A workflow of the retest procedure is presented in Figure 12.</p><p><u>Workflow Control: </u></p><p>The KRAS G13D Reference Standard (15-20 \u00b5m section sample; Horizon Discovery, cat. no.

The PITX2 Percent Methylation Ratio (PMR) obtained for each patient tumor tissue sample (\u2265100 m<sup>2</sup> surface area form 1-2 x 5\u00b5m sections; genomic DNA input 200\u20111000 ng with recommended input of 400 ng and LOD of 4) provides information to the treating physician about whether a patient is likely to benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy. If the PMR obtained is equal to or lower than 12, the patient is likely to benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy. In contrast, if the PMR obtained is higher than 12, an alternative treatment may be proposed, because the patient has a lower probability of responding to anthracycline-based chemotherapy<sup>20</sup>.</p><p><strong><em>Condensed Efficient Fast (CEF) PITX2 workflow applications</em></strong></p><p>The primary objective was to assess if the CEF PITX2 workflow allows a reduction of DNA input. A reduction of DNA input is required to expand the Intended Use of the standard workflow with <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit to core biopsy samples or tumor tissues below 100 mm<sup>2</sup> not only in breast cancer, but potentially also in other cancer indications.</p><p><strong>Comparison of the new CEF PITX2 workflow with standard <em>therascreen </em>PITX2 workflow</strong></p><p>To compare the new CEF workflow with the standard workflow, an exploratory study was performed with Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue (1-2&nbsp;x&nbsp;5 \u00b5m). 100 FFPE samples (27 TNBC and 73 high risk ER+/HER2- BrCa) with known PMR values derived from previous studies with the standard <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 workflow and samples were processed according to the new CEF PITX2 workflow. bisDNA was used undiluted in the qPCR analysis (range input of bisDNA concentration:1.9 - 438.5 ng/\u00b5l). The tissue surface area of the samples ranged from 30-508 mm<sup>2</sup>. The success of the study was determined with the following acceptance criteria a) correlation of PMR values determined with both PITX2 workflows with a regression coefficient of r&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0.7, b) 90% of samples should have \u2265 50 amplifiable copies. This would equal at least an LOD of PMR 4 as established for the standard <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 workflow, and c) the First-Time Sample Pass Rate (FTPR) should be at \u2265&nbsp;90%.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Linear regression analysis for PMR value comparison between standard and CEF workflow.</u></p><p>The correlation between PMR values (n=100) derived from standard <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 and CEF PITX2 workflow were assessed with linear regression analysis.</p><p>The PMR values of PITX2 methylation derived from CEF workflow and standard workflow showed a high correlation with a regression coefficient of r=0.87 (r<sup>2</sup>=0.7586). The study acceptance criteria for the linear regression analysis (r&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0.7) was outreached with the regression coefficient of r&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.87 (Figure 13).</p><p><u>Determination of amplifiable copy numbers obtained with the new CEF PITX2 workflow</u></p><p>The amplifiable copy number is calculated by using REF50 as reference which contains 1000 methylated and 1000 unmethylated copies by the formula:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>2^-deltaCt: copies (sample; meth or unmeth)=1000/2^(CTsample - CTREF50).&nbsp;</p><p>The total amplifiable copy number equals the sum of methylated and unmethylated amplified copies.</p><p>The copy numbers of the 100 samples tested ranged from 80 to 145,411 copies amplified (Figure 14).</p><p>In 100% of samples more than 50 copies (equals a calculated LOD of 4) were detected. 98% of samples had more than 100 copies (equals a calculated LOD of 2), 96% of samples had more than 250 copies (equals a calculated LOD of 0.8) and 94% of samples (equals a calculated LOD of 0.4) had more than 500 copies (Table 11).</p><p>The study acceptance criteria for the CEF PITX2 workflow (90% of samples with \u2265 50 amplifiable copies) was reached with 100% of samples. The results also show a potential of reducing the LOD from 4 to 1-2 at a minimal tissue surface area of \u2265 100 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p><u>First-Time Sample Pass Rate (FTPR)</u></p><p>The bisDNA concentration for each of the 100 FFPE samples was determined by OD 260 measurement with the QIAxpert ssDNA plugin (A260 = 1 = 33 ng/\u00b5l). The bisDNA concentration ranged between 1.9 ng/\u00b5l to 438.5 ng/\u00b5l. All samples were valid in the first qPCR run according to sample validity criteria in the <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 RGQ PCR Assay profile 1.0.1. which equals a FTSPR of 100%.</p><p>The study acceptance criteria for the CEF PITX2 workflow (FTPR&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;90%) was met with FTSPR of 100% for undiluted samples with&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;50 amplifiable copies.</p><p>In summary, all three acceptance criteria set for the new CEF PITX2 workflow were reached and showed the potential of the CEF PITX2 workflow to reduce the DNA input/tumor tissue surface area for PMR analysis. These results prompted us to determine the recommendable bisDNA input and required tumor surface tissue area for the CEF PITX2 workflow.</p><p><strong>Determination of DNA input to be recommended for the CEF PITX2 workflow</strong></p><p>To assess the lower limit of bisDNA input to obtain valid qPCR results with the <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 Kit applying the CEF PITX2 workflow and obtaining a First-Time Sample Pass Rate \u2265&nbsp;90%, bis DNA samples ranging from 2ng/ml up to 6 ng/ml were tested. The PMR values for PITX2 in the diluted samples were compared to the PMR values in the undiluted samples. For the recommendation of the optimal DNA input, the following criteria had to be fulfilled: a) the correlation of the PMR values obtained in the undiluted versus the diluted samples should reach a regression coefficient of r \u2265 0.9, and b) a FTSPR \u2265&nbsp;90% should be delivered.</p><p>Table 12 depicts the regression coefficients obtained by comparing the PMR values in various bisDNA concentrations used in these sets of experiments. The results demonstrate that the threshold of a regression coefficient of r \u2265 0.9 was reached with all dilutions ranging from 2-6 ng/\u00b5l.&nbsp;</p><p>The second objective for the optimal DNA input was based on the criteria of FTSPR \u2265&nbsp;90%. Table 13 summarizes the results of the FTSPR achieved based on testing at each DNA input concentration 30 to 50 samples. The predetermined threshold of FTSPR \u2265&nbsp;90% was only achieved at 6 ng/ml.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, these data define 6&nbsp;ng/\u00b5l bisDNA input as the \u201crecommended input\u201d for the new PITX2 CEF workflow. Lower bisDNA concentrations down to 2&nbsp;ng/\u00b5l may be possible as \u201cminimal input\u201d but associated with a higher sample invalidity rate.</p><p><strong><u>Calculation of amplifiable copy numbers</u></strong></p><p>The amplifiable copy numbers were calculated by using REF50 as reference which contains 1000 methylated and 1000 unmethylated copies by the formula:</p><p>2^-deltaCt: copies (sample; meth or unmeth)=1000/2^(CTsample - CTREF50).&nbsp;</p><p>The total amplifiable copy number equals the sum of methylated and unmethylated amplified copies.</p><p>The copy numbers were calculated for the bisDNA concentrations obtained at 2-6 ng/ml DNA input. Table 14 outlines the copy numbers achieved at the various DNA input concentrations.&nbsp;</p><p>Concentrations below the recommended bisDNA input of 6&nbsp;ng/\u00b5l showed a minimum of amplifiable copies below 50 and an average between 113 to 228 for 2-4 ng/\u00b5l bisDNA, respectively. For the recommended bisDNA input of 6 ng/\u00b5l, the achieved amplifiable copy number was at minimum 62 and at average 373 which is sufficient to reach a FTSPR of 92%.</p><p><strong><u>Calculation of recommended tissue surface area (mm</u></strong><sup><strong><u>2</u></strong></sup><strong><u>) for CEF PITX2 workflow</u></strong></p><p>The tissue surface area (mm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated according to the ratio of dilution (6 ng/\u00b5l) to the original undiluted bisDNA concentration of the study group (n=46) extrapolated to the whole tissue surface area (mm<sup>2</sup>) for valid samples. Tumor tissue surface area was determined from scans of Haematoxilin-Eosine&nbsp;stained sections on slides with the Hamamatsu&nbsp;Nanozoomer virtual microscope using the freehand region tool of the NDP.view software version 2. One sample was omitted from 46 valid samples due to missing tissue surface area information which resulted in n=45 samples for data analysis (Table 15).</p><p>The calculated tissue surface area ranges from 3.1 to 42.9 mm<sup>2</sup> with an average of 12.5 mm<sup>2</sup> (Table 15 A).</p><p>The minimal calculated tissue surface area to reach \u2265 90% sample validity is 30 mm<sup>2</sup> (Table 15 B) which is 3.3 times lower than the recommended tissue surface of 100 mm<sup>2</sup> for the standard <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 workflow.</p><p>With a recommended input of 6&nbsp;ng/\u00b5l bisDNA for qPCR analysis, the required tissue surface area is reduced by 3.3-fold, reducing the surface area from 100&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> (standard PITX2 workflow) to about 30 mm<sup>2</sup> (CEF PITX2 workflow).</p><p>Therefore, the new CEF PITX2 workflow facilitates to determine PMR from tumor core biopsies (on average between 20-40 mm<sup>2</sup> per FFPE tissue section) from 1-2 x 5 \u00b5m sections.</p><p>The recommended DNA input is decreased by 4.5-fold with the new CEF PITX2 workflow compared to the standard <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 workflow.

The Intended Use (IUS) of this kit covers lymph node-positive, estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative high-risk breast cancer patients treated in the adjuvant setting with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and requires 400&nbsp;ng genomic DNA as recommended DNA input extracted from 1-2&nbsp;x&nbsp;5&nbsp;\u00b5m Formalin-Fixed-Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) &nbsp;sections with a minimal total tumor tissue surface area of \u2265 100 mm<sup>2</sup>. In today\u2019s clinical workflow of early high-risk breast cancer patient therapy, increasing number of patients are treated in the neoadjuvant setting after tumor biopsy with anthracycline-based chemotherapy before tumor resection by surgery. Biopsy material size restriction in this clinical area requires for a predictive marker test to be applicable biopsy specimens with tumor tissue surface area\u2019s in the range of 20-50 mm<sup>2</sup>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> Therefore, a modified PITX2 workflow protocol - the so-called <strong>\u201cCondensed Efficient Fast (CEF)\u201d PITX2 workflow</strong> \u2013 was developed to address this need. The required modifications of the standard <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 workflow is described in the \u201cbisDNA Preparation\u201d section. The \u201cPMR Detection &amp; Analysis\u201d section of the standard <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 workflow remains unchanged. The new CEF PITX2 workflow is for <strong>Research Use Only (RUO)</strong> and intended to be used by qualified users such as technicians, molecular biologists/clinical chemists, or physicians. The complete CEF&nbsp;PITX2 workflow is optimized for medium sample through-put with highly reliable and robust read-out and can be performed in two working days.</p><p><br></p>",
