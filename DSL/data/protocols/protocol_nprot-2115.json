            "content": "Targefect-RAW is a new reagent from Targeting Systems specifically designed for the transfection of the RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell line. Although these cells are quite useful for studying innate immune responses and numerous other processes, they are resilient  to transfect by calcium phosphate, electroporation, and lipid-based delivery methods. Thus, reproducible transient transfection of reporter plasmids and cDNAs proves difficult,  and the creation of stable RAW transfectants is limited. To address these limitations, Targefect-RAW combines lipid-based transfection with a novel component, Virofect, to significantly enhance delivery and subsequent expression of plasmid DNA. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nVirofect enhances gene expression by utilizing adenoviral receptors on the cell surface to increase uptake and intracellular delivery of transfection complexes, while also preventing lysosomal degradation of the complexes. When used in combination with Targefect-RAW reagent, Virofect dramatically enhances plasmid delivery and expression, providing an easy to use, highly superior tool for RAW cell transfection."

Complex 6 \u03bcg DNA with 12 \u03bcl of targefect and 24 \u03bcl of Virofect. in 0.6 ml of serum-free high glucose DMEM. \r\n  2.  Incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 20 minutes to form transfection complexes, shake well after each addition.\r\n  \r\n\n\n*Addition of transfection complexes to cell:\r\n\n\nTransfection in 12-well dishes*:\r\n\n\n1. Dilute 125 ul of complexes in an equal amount of complete medium and add to the cells for 2 hours at 37\u201eaC. \r\n  2. Add 600-800 ul complete medium to cells, and incubate for 24 - 36 hours before assay. Targefect-RAW transfections can be easily scaled for any size plate or dish and are comparable in time and difficulty to other commercial transfection protocols. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Transfection in 6-well dishes**: We also recommend  aspirating of all the media from the 6-well dish leaving 500 \u03bcl of supernatant on the cells. Add 250 \u03bcl of transfection complex to 500 \u03bcl of the cell supernatants mix well and incubate overnight \\(the latter condition gave some improvement). Assay at 36-48 hrs post transfection\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor transfection in 24-well dishes transfect as above adding 70 ul of transfeciton complex per well of a 24-well dish"
