We describe a simple method for the preparation of the PG-depleted SME \\(SME-&#x0394;PG)  by treatment with recombinant peptidoglycan recognition protein \\(PGRP)-LB, a PG-degrading enzyme. \\(SME-&#x0394;PG) has been successfully used for dissecting the PG-independent immune signaling pathways in _Drosophila_ gut. The \\(SME-&#x0394;PG) will be a potentially useful material to dissect PG-independent host response to microbes in diverse biological systems."

Transform _E. coli_ BL21 \\(DE3) cells by heat shock according to the manufacturers' protocol with the pProEx HTa vector containing the full-length _PGRP-LB_ gene. Plate the transformed cells onto ampicillin-LB agar plates. Grow at 37 \u00b0C overnight.\r\n  2. Pick a single colony and inoculate a starter culture of 2 ml ampicillin-LB medium. Place the culture in an incubator overnight at 37 \u00b0C and 200 r.p.m.\r\n  3. Next morning, inoculate 50 ml ampicillin-LB medium in a shaker flask. Place the culture in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 200 r.p.m. for 2 h.\r\n  4. Inoculate 1 liter ampicillin-LB medium in a 2-liter flask with the culture from Step 3. \r\n  5. Grow the cultures in an incubator shaker at 37 \u00b0C and 200 r.p.m. until the optical density at 600 nm reaches 1.0.\r\n  6. Place the flasks in an ice water bath and rapidly cool the cultures to 18 \u00b0C.\r\n  7. Induce protein expression by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. Continue to grow the cultures at 18 \u00b0C and 200 r.p.m. for 4 h.\r\n  8. Transfer the cells to centrifuge tubes and harvest the cells by centrifuging for 15 min at 5,000g and 4 \u00b0C. \r\n  9. Discard the supernatant and collect the cell pellet. \r\n  10. Resuspend the pellet in 50 ml of cell lysis buffer at 4 \u00b0C with glass rod until the suspension is homogeneous.\r\n  11. Place the suspension on ice and lyse the cells using sonication in a series of 10-s pulses to avoid heating until the suspension loses viscosity. \r\n  12. Centrifuge for 50 min at 15,000g and 4 \u00b0C to pellet cellular debris.\r\n  13. Collect the supernatant. Then, filtrate the supernatant through a 0.45 \u03bcm pore membrane. \r\n  14. Prepare the 5 ml of Ni-NTA agarose resin according to the manufacturers' instructions and equilibrate the resin with the cell lysis buffer. All purification steps should be carried out at 4 \u00b0C with ice-cold buffers. \r\n  15. Load the supernatant collected from the Step 13 onto a column containing the equilibrated Ni-NTA agarose resin. \r\n  16. Wash the column with 50 ml cell lysis buffer.\r\n  17. Wash the column with 50 ml 40 mM imidazole wash buffer. \r\n  18. Elute the protein with 15 ml 200 mM imidazole wash buffer. \r\n  19. Transfer the elution fraction from the Step 18 into a dialysis membrane bag \\(molecular weigh cut-off of 3.5 KDa). \r\n  20. Immerse the bag in dialysis buffer \\(more than 50 times the volume of the elution fraction) and agitate the bag with a magnetic stir bar at 4 \u00b0C for 4 h.\r\n  21. Transfer the content of the bag to a clean beaker. \r\n  22. Add TEV-protease according to the manufacturers' instructions and incubate or overnight at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n  23. Check the cleavage by running SDS-PAGE and comparing the apparent molecular weight of PGRP-LB before and after the TEV-protease treatment.\r\n  24. Equilibrate a HiTrapQ column connected to the AKTA HPLC system with the dialysis buffer. \r\n  25. Load the sample from the Step 23 onto the HiTrapQ column. Collect and save the flow-through containing the unbound material.\r\n  26. Apply a linear gradient from the dialysis buffer to NaCl wash buffer over 15 column volumes. \r\n  27. Fractions containing PGRP-LB are identified using SDS-PAGE. PGRP-LB is found in the flow-through and low-salt fractions.\r\n  28. Equilibrate a HiTrapSP column connected to the AKTA HPLC system with the dialysis buffer.\r\n  29. Collect the fractions from the Step 27 and load the sample onto the HiTrapSP column. Collect and save the flow-through containing the unbound material.\r\n  30. Apply a linear gradient from the dialysis buffer to the NaCl wash buffer over 15 column volumes. \r\n  31. Fractions containing PGRP-LB are identified using SDS-PAGE. PGRP-LB is found in the flow-through and low-salt fractions.\r\n  32. Concentrate PGRP-LB from the Step 31 to 6 mg/ml using an VivaSpin 20 centrifugal concentrator following the manufacturers' instructions.\r\n  33. Freeze in liquid nitrogen in 100 \u03bcl aliquots and store at -80 \u00b0C. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**B. Preparation of SME.**\r\n\n\n1. Inoculate a culture of 100 ml LB medium with a bacterial strain, _Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15_. \r\n  2. Grow at 30 \u00b0C for 16 h with vigorous shaking \\(~300 rpm).\r\n  3. Harvest the bacteria by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n  4. Wash the pellet 2 times with 1 ml PBS.\r\n  5. Prepare ~200 mg \\(wet weight) of bacterial pellet.\r\n  6. Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 2 ml PBS.\r\n  7. Transfer to the centrifuge tube containing 0.5 mm glass beads \\(Grind kit for Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies)\r\n  8. Cell lysis by using Precellys 24 homogenizer at 6,500 rpm for 15 sec by repeating 3 times \\(Bertin Technology).\r\n  9. Lyophilze the the lysate.\r\n  10. Resuspend the dry pellet with 2ml of 100% methanol.\r\n  11. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min.\r\n  12. Lyophilize the supernatant.\r\n  13. Dissolve the dry pellet with 1 ml H\n2\nO. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**C. Preparation of SME-\u0394PG.**\r\n\n\n1. Add 560 ng of recombinant PGRP-LB to SME \\(50 mg).\r\n  2. Incubate the mixture for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C.\r\n  3. The depletion of PG in SME-\u0394PG can be confirmed by examining the absence of _Diptericin_ gene \\(PG-dependent gene) induction in SME-\u0394PG treated _Drosophila_ mbn2 cells."
