            "content": "Type II fatty acid synthesis \\(FASII) is essential to bacterial cell viability. The significant differences between bacteria and humans in organization, structure of enzymes, and the role played by fatty acids make this pathway an attractive target for antibacterial drug discovery \\(refs. 1,2). Two marketed antibacterial agents that target the FabI enzyme are triclosan \\(antiseptic) and isoniazid \\(an anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis agent) \\(refs 3,4). Two natural products, cerulenin \\(ref. 5) and thiolactomycin \\(ref. 6) which selectively inhibit the condensation enzymes FabH and FabF/B, were discovered more than two decades ago. New screening efforts and chemical modifications of existing compounds have been attempted to identify more selective and potent inhibitors. To determine the selectivity of the inhibitors identified during screening efforts we developed gel-elongation assay using crude bacterial lysate directly to determine the target specificities of fatty acid synthesis inhibitors \\(refs. 7,8)."

            "content": "In bacteria, FabH catalyzes the first condensation reaction using acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP to produce acetoacetyl-ACP.  This product is reduced by FabG, dehydrated by FabA/Z to produce C4:1\\(&#x394;2)-ACP, and then reduced second time by FabI to make butyryl-ACP \\(C4:0-ACP)which is substrate for FabF/B condensing enzymes.  Cerulenin, a selective FabF/B inhibitor, at 200 &#xB5;g/ml accumulates butyryl-ACP and thiolactomycin \\(333 &#xB5;g/ml) inhibits both FabH and FabF/B condensing enzymes resulting in a minor accumulation of butyryl-ACP while leaving a majority of malonyl-ACP unreacted.  Triclosan \\(100 &#xB5;g/ml) treatment leads to the accumulation of C4:1\\(&#x394;2)-ACP due to its inhibition of FabI.  In the gel elongation assay using _E. coli_ extracts \\(Fig. 1), the inhibition observed with platensimycin \\(167 &#xB5;g/ml ) was similar to that seen with cerulenin, and different from that observed with thiolactomycin and triclosan, indicating that platensimycin selectively targets FabF/B.  Similarly, titration of platensimycin using a _S. aureus_ gel elongation assay, with octanoyl-CoA \\(C8:0) and malonyl-CoA as substrates, showed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.2 &#xB5;g/ml \\(Fig 2). At higher concentrations of platensimycin an accumulation of malonyl-ACP was observed, demonstrating that this inhibitor does not block FabD, a malonyl CoA:ACP transacylase.  The lower concentrations of platensimycin produced partial inhibition of elongation activity and accumulations of C2n:0-ACP \\(n&gt;4), further indicating that the target of inhibition in _S. aureus_ is the FabF condensing enzyme."
