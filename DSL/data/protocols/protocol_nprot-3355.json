            "content": "As ocean ecology attempts to advance from observations to predictions, modeling becomes of fundamental importance. While two decades of viral ecology research has focused on community level understanding through measuring viral abundance, production, decay, and frequency of infected cells \\(_reviewed by Ref <sup>1</sup>_), little is known about the fundamental question of \u201cwho infects whom?\u201d.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCultivation-based methods can directly link a virus strain to its host; however, it is impossible to characterize millions of viruses per milliliter of seawater and thousands to 100s of thousands of \u201cviral types\u201d per sampling site<sup>2</sup> using traditional low-throughput cultivation methods. For example, Fluorescently Labeled Viruses \\(FLVs) have been used as probes to \u201ctag\u201d their host cells for examination under the microscope<sup>3-5</sup>, a method that is limited only by being low-throughput. Here, as illustrated in Fig 1, we expand upon the use of FLVs to tag host cells by \\(_i_) incorporating flow cytometry to enable high-throughput detection and sequencing of infected host cells, and \\(_ii_) isotope labeling host cells to minimize the bacterial DNA in the viral tagging metagenome. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3217/original/viral_tagging_schematic_ABC.jpg?1407286075\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n**Figure 1. Overview for viral tagging \\(VT)**\r\n\n\n**A.** Environmental viruses are fluorescently-labeled green, then mixed with potential host bacteria which are labeled with heavy isotope, but flow cytometrically green-negative. \r\n\n\n**B.** Flow cytometry data triggered on forward scatter for the fluorescently labeled virus and host bacteria co-incubated at desire VBR. Tagged cells infecting by viruses with extra fluorescence can be sorted out from non-infected cells.\r\n\n\n**C.** DNA is extracted from the sorted, viral-tagged population. Isotopically light viral DNA is then separated from heavy host DNA using a density gradient for the downstream amplification and sequencing."

Prepare SNAX medium according to directions\n6\n, but use\n15\nN ammonium chloride which will provide the heavy isotope. Grow cyanobacteria in the medium with heavy nitrogen and transfer at least 3 times before use.\r\n  2. Extract DNA from bacterial grown in heavy nitrogen using standard methods.\r\n  3. Quantify the DNA using Quant-iT Pico Green \\(Invitrogen #P7589).\r\n  4. Use at least 10 \u00b5g of DNA for density gradient centrifugation.\r\n  5. For density gradient centrifugation, a Beckman VTi 65 vertical rotor was used with 13x48 mm OptiSeal polyallomer tubes \\(4.9 ml capacity).\r\n  6. Mix the DNA with TE buffer \\(10mM Tris, 1mM EDTA, pH7.6) to a final volume of 0.9 ml.\r\n  7. Mix the DNA with 4ml of CsCl prepared in TE to a density of p1.8 \\(measure the density of the final solutions, they should be p1.7).\r\n  8. Dispense 4.9 ml of the DNA sample in CsCl into the OptiSeal tube and plug with the black caps.\r\n  9. Centrifuge at 44,000 rpm \\(=184,678.5 g) in a Beckman L70 or L80 ultracentrifuge for 48 hr at 18\u00b0C \\(Caution:  do not centrifuge at lower temperatures as CsCl may precipitate out). \r\n  10. Collect 0.2-0.25 ml fractions and measure the density of each.  \r\n  11. Calculate amount of DNA in each fraction using Quant-iT Pico Green \\(perform in dulicate) to determine the density of the fractions with DNA. Estimate the ratio of isotopic labeled cells.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Preparation of SYBR Gold working stock**\r\n\n\n1. Thaw 10,000x stock of SYBR Gold in the dark and vortex vigorously.\r\n  2. Centrifuge for 10 min at 3000 x g.\r\n  3. Dilute 1:100 \\(to 100x) with TE buffer and then filter through 0.02\u00b5m filter.\r\n  4. Aliquot into 50 or 100\u00b5l amounts and store frozen at -20\u00b0C.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n**SYBR-Gold Staining of Virus**\r\n\n\n1. Thaw prepared 100X SYBR Gold the dark, one time only \\(do not refreeze).  \r\n  2. Vortex thawed SYBR Gold vigorously before using to stain viruses.\r\n  3. If using CsCl-purified virus, dialyze in modified MTN buffer.\r\n  4. Stain the viruses by adding prepared SYBR Gold to the viral suspension to a final concentration of 5x for a concentrated viral stock \\(equal to or greater than E+09) or 1x for less concentrated viral stock \\(\n15\nN-labeled \u201cheavy\u201d host DNA from non-labeled \u201clight\u201d viral DNA by CsCl density ultracentrifugation.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Ocean viruses are abundant, ubiquitous, and play important roles in global biogeochemical cycles through mortality, horizontal gene transfer and manipulation of host metabolism. However, the ability to link viruses to their hosts in a high-throughput manner bottlenecks our ability to understand virus-host interactions in complex communities. Here, we present viral tagging \\(VT), a method that combines mixtures of isotope labeled host cells and fluorescent viruses with flow cytometry. In a single experiment, we can screen 10<sup>7</sup> uncultivated ocean viruses with a single strain of _Synechococcus_. These viruses can then be sequenced to quantitatively link objectively defined environmental viral populations, and their genomes, to their hosts.",
