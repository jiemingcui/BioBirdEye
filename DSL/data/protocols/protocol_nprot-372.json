As opposed to their natural congeners they are not prone to enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis. They can be prepared as anomerically pure glycosides and are isosteric to the heteroatom containing counterparts.<sup>1</sup>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHere we describe the synthesis of an alkynyl C-galactoside which was successfully employed in protein modification reactions by Cu\\(I) catalysed triazole formation.<sup>2</sup> The syntheses of the corresponding C-glucoside<sup>3</sup> and C-mannoside<sup>4</sup> have been described previously in the literature.<sup>3,4</sup> \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/775/display/c-gal2.png\">See figure in Figures section.</a>"
