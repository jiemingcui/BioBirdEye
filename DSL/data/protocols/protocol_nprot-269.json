            "content": "Here we describe the chemically-reconstituted system for evaluating the antimicrobial activity of the microbial protease-mediated ROS production from the hemocyanin-prophenoloxidase \\(HMC/PPO)or hemoglobin.  The antimicrobial activity is examined by endpoint measurement of the remnant microbial population or by real-time observation of the bactericidal process.  To demonstrate the specificity of PO-induced ROS-production which causes the antimicrobial activity, PTU is used here as a specific inhibitor of PO activity."

For the end-point measurement of HMC/PPO: \r\n  \\(a) incubate the bacteria under test at 10\n6\ncfu/ml with 60 \u03bcg purified HMC plus 100 nmol 4-methylcatechol \\(4ME) in 100 \u03bcl PBS at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. \r\n\n\n\\(b) then enumerate the remnant bacterial population in the reaction mixture by plating 100 \u03bcl of serially diluted samples on nutrient agar plates and incubating at 37 \u00b0C overnight.  Perform the colony count and calculate the bacterial cfu/ml.\r\n\n\n\\(c) add 10 nmol of phenylthiourea \\(PTU) to the reactions in order to  evaluate the impact of PO activity.  \r\n\n\n\\(d) also set up controls by incubating bacteria with HMC/PPO or 4ME or PTU separately, or in combinations.  \r\n\n\n3. For real-time imaging of the bacterial clearance elicited by HMC/PPO: \r\n  \\(a) mix each bacterial strain at 10\n7\ncfu/ml with 60 \u03bcg HMC/PPO and 100 nmol 4ME in 100 \u03bcl PBS.  \r\n\n\n\\(b) apply one \u03bcl of the mixture to fluorescence microscopy and examine it at  magnification of 63 x 1.6, with time-elapse method.  \r\n\n\n\\(c)  capture images at intervals of 30 s for 1 h, and make a movie.  \r\n\n\n4.  For the end-point measurement of metHb: \r\n  \\(a) incubate the bacteria under test at 10\n6\ncfu/ml with 36 \u03bcg metHb and 1.6 \u03bcmol H\n2\nO\n2\nin 200 \u03bcl PBS at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.  \r\n\n\n\\(b) then enumerate the remnant bacterial population in the reaction mixture by plating 100 \u03bcl of serially diluted samples on nutrient agar plates and incubating at 37 \u00b0C overnight.  Perform the colony count and calculate the bacterial cfu/ml.\r\n\n\n\\(c) to further prove that the antibacterial activity was indeed attributable to ROS, apply 2 \u03bcmol GSH to the incubation mixture to quench the superoxide ions.  \r\n\n\n\\(d) set up controls by incubating bacteria with metHb, H\n2\nO\n2\nor GSH separately or in combinations."

            "content": "In the presence of the HMC/PPO and its substrate, more of the protease-producing bacteria are cleared compared to those of the protease-inactive strains.  This difference can be reduced when ROS quenchers \\(eg: GSH for both quinone and superoxide anion or SOD for superoxide anion) are applied.  When supplemented with exogenous proteases, the antimicrobial effect of the protease-inactive strains is increased dose-dependently.  \\(Refer to the example shown in figure 5 as a typical result obtained using HMC)."
