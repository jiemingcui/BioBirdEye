For velocity sedimentation assays we used 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> \\[2].\r\n\n\n\u2022 Breaking buffer with protease inhibitors.  Add inhibitors as required for your particular application.  For example, we used 1 complete tablet without EDTA \\(Roche) per 50 ml breaking buffer, 1 mM phenylmethylsylfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Yeast cell pellets, obtained from a culture grown to A<sub>600nm</sub>=1 or less, washed with ice cold water or breaking buffer. Pellet may be fresh or stored at -20\u00b0C or -80\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\u2022 If required, reagents to determine protein concentration \\(here we used the Bradford method).  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Material**\r\n\n\n\u2022 Round base tubes, 13 ml, 16x100mm, polypropylene, \\(Sarstedt, order No 62.515.006), or round base tubes with similar diameter.\r\n\n\n\u2022 1.5 ml microfuge tubes.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Acid washed and autoclaved glass beads, 0.5 mm diameter.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Cuvettes for spectrophotometer."

Efficient breakage is visible by the sample forming a whitish film and tiny bubbles on the inside wall of the tube \\(see Figure 1).\r\n\n\n**6.** Place sample in a mixture of ice and water for 30 sec. \r\n\n\n**7.** Repeat steps 5 and 6 seven more times.\r\n\n\nTip: If more than one sample needs to be processed the time spent for cell breakage can be shortened by vortexing 2 samples at a time on 2 vortexers for 30 sec.  While these samples rest for 30 sec the next 2 samples can be vortexed.\r\n\n\n**8.** Spin samples at 4\u00b0C for 3 min at low g \\(e.g. 2,500g). If a centrifuge for round base tubes is not available, transfer samples to microfuge tubes and spin in microfuge centrifuge at low speed.\r\n\n\n**9.** Transfer supernatant to fresh microfuge tubes.\r\n\n\n**10.** Spin in microfuge centrifuge at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. \r\n\n\n**11.** Transfer supernatants to fresh tubes.  \r\n\n\nNote: A highly concentrated WCE has an opaque appearance.  A yellowish colour is due to pigments and does not necessarily indicate good breakage.  \r\n\n\n**12.** Depending on your subsequent application, determine the protein concentration e.g. via the Bradford method, or determine the A\n260nm\n, using breaking buffer alone as reference."

Highly concentrated extracts are used for many applications such as protein purification, purification of protein complexes \\(in particular when interactions are weak), protein-protein interaction studies, and velocity sedimentation studies.  Normally highly concentrated extracts are generated with homogenizers or the French press.  However, such equipment 1) is expensive, 2) is not available to every researcher, and/or 3) often cannot be used for cells from small culture volumes.  The procedure described here can be used for breaking cells originating from cultures as small as 100 ml, although a culture volume of at least 200 ml gives the best result.  Furthermore, this method is also effective for breaking formaldehyde crosslinked cells.",
