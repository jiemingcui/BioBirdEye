Note that PFA is a polymer of formaldehyde that must be hydrolyzed to be functional. This is done by heating the aqueous solution (60\u00b0C) and increasing the pH with NaOH.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 0.25 g of PFA\u00a0to 22.5 ml of double-distilled water in a 50 ml conic tube. Add one drop of 1 M NaOH. Incubate in 60\u00b0C water bath for at least 20 minutes. Invert every 5 minutes or so to ensure all PFA is dissolved.\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Allow solution to cool to room temperature before adjusting the pH to 9.2 using 50mM boric acid (usually takes about 0.5 ml).\nc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 35 \u00b5l of Triton X-100 (0.15% final v/v). Make sure is completely dissolved before use. Triton X-100 is a nonionic detergent that bursts the nuclear envelope. This is done concomitantly with the formaldehyde fixation step.\nd.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 150 \u00b5l of a 500 mM solution of DTT\u00a0to the fix (final concentration: 3 mM DTT)\n2.\nThaw out Tyrode\u2019s solution aliquot and pre-warm to 37\u00b0C\n.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pre-warm aliquot (approx. 1 ml) of 0.9% sodium citrate solution to 37\u00b0C.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare a humid chamber with hot water before beginning protocol.\n5.\nEtch and clean microscope slides. Use a diamond pen to draw a circle in the middle on the\nunderside\nof the slide where you will drop the oocyte. Use ethanol or IMS to wipe the slides to remove grease using standard laboratory tissue wipes.\nProcedure:\nThe following steps are carried out under the stereomicroscope on a heated stage.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place the slides in a Coplin jar containing in 1% formaldehyde solution to coat the slide.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using a 130 \u00b5m micropipette, transfer the MI or MII oocyte to a 30 \u00b5l drop of Tyrode\u2019s solution on the lid of a culture dish.

            "content": "<p>Step 1: The final 1% formaldehyde solution can be stored at 4\u00b0C.&nbsp;However, the PFA will eventually fall out of solution and change the final concentration; therefore, discard after two weeks to avoid suboptimal fixation.</p><p>Step 2: Once a Tyrode\u2019s solution aliquot has been thawed, refreezing and thawing will cause the efficiency of the solution to decrease.&nbsp;Make small enough aliquots (~500 \u00b5l) from the stock bottle to allow for limited refreezing.</p><p>Step 6: &nbsp;Low humidity can impact the speed of formaldehyde evaporation and can decrease the quality of the spreads. If you work in a dry environment use a humidifier in the room.</p><p>Step 7: &nbsp;The zona will usually slough off with mechanical movement of the oocyte.&nbsp;However, sometimes the Tyrode\u2019s will simply thin the zona until it is not visible, but will still stop the oocyte from properly bursting on the slide.&nbsp;In this case, for MII oocytes it is easiest to see any residual zona by looking at where the zona is pulled away from the oocyte by the polar body, or simply by the act of the polar body separating from the oocyte.&nbsp;With MI oocytes this is much more difficult; therefore, leave the oocyte in the Tyrode\u2019s solution for approx. 10 extra seconds if no visible zona has separated from the oocyte.&nbsp;When spreading oocytes expect to have relatively low efficiency.&nbsp;Our rates from spreading to analysis was slightly more than 25%.</p><p>Step 8:&nbsp;If the oocyte is left in Tyrode\u2019s for too long, it will either burst in the Tyrode\u2019s or immediately upon transfer to the sodium citrate wash drops.&nbsp;To limit time in Tyrode\u2019s, the oocyte can be moved to the sodium citrate drops before the zona has completely dissociated from the oocyte.&nbsp;The oocyte should then be pipetted up and down to completely remove the zona by the time the cell is in the final wash drop. At this point the oocytes will be extremely sticky, and therefore, when in the sodium citrate drops try to continuously pipette the oocyte so that it does not settle onto the bottom of the dish.</p><p>Step 9:&nbsp;At this stage hold the oocyte in your pipette before retrieving your slide to again avoid the oocyte settling, and sticking, to the bottom of your dish.&nbsp;Minimize the amount of liquid transferred to limit the dilution of the formaldehyde solution coating the slide.&nbsp;If too much liquid is transferred, this can lead to a poor burst and poor fixation.</p><p>Step 10:&nbsp;When removing excess formaldehyde from the slide, only a quick dab on the end of the slide is needed.&nbsp;However, it is also important to wipe the back of the slide.&nbsp;If the back is not wiped, the slide wiill suction onto the stage and makes it difficult to quickly move the slide to the humid chamber without tipping it.</p><p>Step 11:&nbsp;It is important to limit the amount of media that is transferred, as it will dilute the formaldehyde solution on the slide and impact fixation.&nbsp; If the oocyte does not burst, agitate the liquid surrounding the cell with the pipette tip (careful to not aspirate any liquid) until you see the cell start to lyse.&nbsp;However, do not agitate too much as it may cause the chromosomes to spread excessively on the slide and cause unintended chromosomal loss.</p><p>Step 12:&nbsp;Slides should be slow dried in the humid chamber for a minimum of 2 hours.&nbsp;We have also found no difference if the slides are left to dry overnight.&nbsp;However, try to not leave the slides for more than 24 hours as the quality of protein staining may decrease.</p><p>Step 14:&nbsp;The Photoflo wash is to remove any excess debris from the slide.&nbsp;It is best to complete this step prior to storage, however, the Photoflo wash can also be completed after thawing prior to staining.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>This protocol outlines the generation of metaphase spreads of a single oocyte at either the immature metaphase I (MI) or mature metaphase II (MII) stage.&nbsp;This protocol utilizes formaldehyde fixation and therefore allows for further immunofluorescence analysis.&nbsp;These spreads can also be used to identify aneuploidy and other large-scale structural chromosomal abnormalities.&nbsp;However, this assay is prone to false positives for whole chromosome aneuploidy losses, due to either fixation failure or excessive spreading leading to an inability to find all the chromosomes.&nbsp;Additionally, success rates can be low using human oocytes compared to similar protocols for mouse oocytes due to difficulty bursting the oocyte membrane and providing sufficient dispersion of the chromosomes for individual analysis. The protocol duration is two days, however, immunofluorescence staining will add to the total time before final analysis.</p>",
