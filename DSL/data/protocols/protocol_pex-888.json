            "content": "<p>Thermogenic adipocytes (brown adipocytes and beige/brite adipocytes) have emerged as being a therapeutically useful cell type for the treatment of obesity-associated metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes<sup>1, 2</sup>. While brown adipocytes are derived through a paraxial mesoderm-dermomyotome precursor, beige/brite adipocytes are generated from an adult adipose progenitor cell<sup>1, 2</sup>. Unlike traditional white adipose cells that store lipids, thermogenic adipose cells uptake excess fatty acids and glucose from the bloodstream so that they can burn it and release it as heat. This process enables thermogenic adipocytes to normalize whole-body glucose levels and reduce body weight<sup>1, 2</sup>. For these reasons, thermogenic adipocytes are thought to have therapeutic utility<sup>1-3</sup>. While methods have been developed to generate beige/brite using rodent cells or immortalized human lines, protocols have not been established to generate these cells from human adult ADSC with high purity and efficiency<sup>3</sup>.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIn the associated publication, the protocol described here was compared to two previously described methods<sup>4, 5</sup>. Both of these methods relied on serum-based approaches that resulted in inconsistent differentiation efficiencies. The UCP1 levels observed in this protocol were consistently higher at both the transcript and protein level than the methods described by Bartesaghi<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;et al. or Wang<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;et al. The beige adipocytes developed by this protocol were also validated functionally in vivo following transplantation by indirect calorimetry, along with glucose measurements in diabetic models and histological analysis. The beige adipocytes were also used for high throughput drug screens demonstrating the robustness of the differentiation platform.</p><p>\tIn total, 6 primary ADSC lines (purchased from ThermoFisher or Lonza) have been evaluated using this protocol with varying sex, BMI and diabetic status, and indicated efficient differentiation based on UCP1 staining. Major differences could not be noted between any of these factors. Here a protocol is provided using the StemPro\u00d4&nbsp;Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Kit for differentiation to beige adipocytes. As an alternative choice, the Lonza ADSC, along with the ADSC Growth Medium BulletKit\u00d4&nbsp;may be used.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Beige adipocytes (also known as brite adipocytes) have significant utility for numerous applications, such as drug screening, cell therapy, and disease modelling. However, a high-efficiency protocol from human adult adipose-derived stem/stromal stem cells (ADSC) has not been described. The protocol described here achieves beige adipocyte purities of &gt;92% in a fully-defined, serum-free media cocktail, which enables these downstream applications. This method provides a significant leap forward over previously described, serum-based protocols that were inconsistent and inefficient.</p>",
