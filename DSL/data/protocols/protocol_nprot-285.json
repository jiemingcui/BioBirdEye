One h \\(for short homing assay) to 24 h \\(for long term homing assay) after the injection of the labeled lymphocytes, lymph nodes, Peyer&#x2019;s patches and other lymphoid organs are isolated and the number of fluorescent lymphocytes over total lymphocyte number is determined.  This process can be inhibited by pre-injection of lectins that specifically bind to glycans that carry L-selectin ligands"

After passing through 70 \u03bcm mesh, centrifuge the medium to collect cells.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4.  The cells are incubated with red blood cell lysis buffer at room temperature for 3 \u2013 5 min, then add 10 times volume of RPMI-1640 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5.  After centrifuge at 1,000x g for 5 min, pellet lymphocytes are suspended in 5 ml of RPMI-1640 containing 1\u03bcM CMFDA solution, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min.\r\n  Alternatively orange tracker Orange CMRA is used insead of CMFDA using the ame conditions.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6.  CMFDA-labeled lymphocytes are recovered by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 5 min, suspended in RPMI-1640 containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Cell pellet is washed with RPMI-1640 twice and cell suspension is passed through 70 \u03bcm mesh, reconstituted in 0.9 % NaCl to obtain two hundred fifty thousand cells per 100  \u03bcl. \r\n  \r\n\n\n7.  E-PHA \\(150 to 400 \u03bcg), LEA \\(150 to 300 \u03bcg) or Con A \\(150 \u03bcg) dissolved in 150 \u03bcl of PBS is intravenously injected through a tail vein.  One hour after the injection of a lectin, CMFDA-labeled lymphocytes \\(twenty five million cells) are injected.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8.  One to 24 h after lymphocyte injection, the mice are sacrificed and the peripheral \\( cervical and lateral axillary) lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer\u2019s patches, spleen, and thymus are collected.   Lymphocytes are squeezed out as described in 2 and 3, debris is removed by passing through 70 \u03bcm mesh and lymphocytes are suspended in 2 ml of PBS.\r\n  \r\n\n\n9.  The cell suspension \\(hundred to hundred fifty thousand  cells) is analyzed by flow cytometry.  The number of fluorescent cells is compared to the number of total cells.  Control experiments are carried out by injecting only PBS.  The ratio of control and lectin-inhibited experiments are compared."

The effect of lectins is highest in lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes, moderate to mesenteric lymph nodes and very moderate to Peyer&#x2019;s patches."
