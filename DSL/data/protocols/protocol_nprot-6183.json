            "content": "Alveolar epithelial type II \\(AT2) cells are tissue stem cells contributing to alveolar homeostasis by self-renewing, differentiating into alveolar type I \\(AT1) cells and producing pulmonary surfactant<sup>9</sup>. However, AT2 cells have been known to lose their specific properties such as the expression of SFTPC immediately after starting conventional two-dimensional culture<sup>10</sup>. Despite the high demand for research use of human alveolar epithelial cells, it has been difficult to obtain primary AT2 cells from clinical lung tissues or achieve efficient induction and expansion of hPSC-derived AT2 cells<sup>4-6,8</sup>. In this protocol, we established a 35-day protocol for induction of alveolar stem cells by forming alveolar organoids \\(AOs) involving human fetal lung fibroblasts \\(fibroblast-dependent AOs, FD-AOs) using preconditioned CPM<sup>high</sup> alveolar progenitor cells derived from hPSCs. This protocol was highly reproducible in multiple hPSC lines and adaptive to long-term expansion of alveolar stem cell maintaining their properties as alveolar stem cells. Finally, we alternatively developed a 28-day protocol for generation of AOs without using human fetal lung fibroblasts \\(fibroblasts-free AOs, FF-AOs). Our methods provide a versatile platform of studying human alveoli in vitro for researchers."

Prepare the required volume of mixture of CPM\nhigh\nprogenitor cells \\(1.0 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells / well) and fibroblasts \\(5.0 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells / well). \r\n  4. Centrifuge the mixture at 900 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n  5. Carefully discard the supernatant and resuspend the mixed cells in required amount of 100 \u00b5l / well of alveolarization medium supplemented with Y27632 \\(10 \u00b5M). \r\n  6. Dispense the cell suspension into 100 \u00b5l. \r\n  7. Mix the cell suspension with equal volume of Matrigel and seed a total volume of 200 \u00b5l / sample onto a cell culture insert prepared in step 1. \r\n  TIPS: In this step, keep Matrigel on ice prior to use.\r\n\n\n8. Change the alveolarization medium without Y27632 every 2 days for 14 days.\r\n   \r\n\n\nE-3.  Passaging of human PSC-derived alveolar stem cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPreparation\r\n\n\n\u00b7 The procedure described in Section E-1 is required a week before passaging. \r\n\n\n\u00b7 Warm required amount \\(2 ml / well) of 0.1 % Trypsin / EDTA. \r\n\n\n\u00b7 Cool centrifuge at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n\n\n\u00b7 Cool 2% FBS / DMEM at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n\n\n\u00b7 Prepare anti-EpCAM antibody solution by mixing 10 \u00b5l / 1.0 \u00d7 10\n7\ncells of APC-conjugated mouse anti-human EpCAM antibody diluted in FACS buffer \\(1:10) on the day of use. Keep away from light and store at 4 \u00b0C.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProcedure\r\n\n\n1. Prepare required number of 15 ml tubes \\(a tube / well) with 6 ml of PBS in a tube. \r\n  2. Remove cell culture inserts from a 12-well plate using sterilized forceps and tap it on a 6-cm sterilized dish. Fibroblast-dependent AO \\(FD-AO) can be easily removed from cell culture inserts. \r\n  3. Mince the FD-AO to about 2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm using sterilized forceps and a disposable scalpel. \r\n  CAUTION: Do not mince FD-AO to too small size. It causes damage of the contained cells. \r\n\n\n4. Wash the dishes three times with 2 ml of PBS and collect the fragments in 15 ml tube prepared in step 1. \r\n  5. Centrifuge the fragments at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n  6. Discard the supernatant and add 2 ml / tube of prewarmed 0.1 % Trypsin / EDTA. \r\n  7. Incubate the tubes at 37 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. \r\n  NOTE: In this step, the fragments of FD-AO will become soft. \r\n\n\n8. Reduce the fragment size by pipetting gently 10 times using P-1000 tips. \r\n  9. Incubate the tubes at 37 \u00b0C for 5 minutes.\r\n  10. Dissociate the fragments by pipetting gently 10 to 15 times using P-1000 tips. \r\n  NOTE: In this step, the fragments will be almost diminished. \r\n\n\n11. Incubate the tubes at 37 \u00b0C for 5 minutes.\r\n  12. Pipetting 10 times again using P-1000 tips and neutralize 0.1 % Trypsin / EDTA by adding 8 ml of precooled 2 % FBS / DMEM. \r\n  CAUTION: Be sure to use precooled 2 % FBS / DMEM. If not, aqueous Matrigel will clot again in the tube involving the cells and spoiled in subsequent steps. \r\n\n\n13. Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 rpm for 7 minutes at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n  CAUTION: Precool the centrifuge machine, or Matrigel may clot again in the tube, which can cause the subsequent steps to fail. \r\n\n\n14. Carefully collect the supernatant to another tube and centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes, 4 \u00b0C.\r\n  NOTE: This step will improve the recovery of the cells. \r\n\n\nCAUTION: Do not aspirate the supernatant adjacent to cell pellets. Occasionally, Matrigel remains in this layer adhering to the cell pellets.\r\n\n\n15. Collect the recovered cells in one tube with 5 ml of FACS buffer and count the number of the cells. \r\n  16. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 \u00b0C and carefully discard the supernatant.\r\n  17. Incubate in anti-EpCAM antibody solution at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes. Keep away from light during incubation.\r\n  18. Add 5 ml / tube of FACS buffer, and centrifuge the cell suspension at 900 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n  19. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 5 ml / tube of FACS buffer. \r\n  20. Centrifuge them at 900 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n  21. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 ml / 8.0 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells of FACS buffer with 1/1000 volume of PI stock solution. \r\n  22. Strain the cells through a cell strainer with 40 \u00b5m mesh.\r\n  CAUTION: If not, the buffer containing the cells can splash in Step 23\r\n\n\n23. Prepare cells for FACS in a round bottom tube capped with a cell strainer. \r\n  24. Prepare the collection tubes with 1 ml / tube of FACS buffer for sorted cells. \r\n  25. Sort the EpCAM\n+\nSFTPC\n+\ncells using FACS Aria II or Aria III. \r\n  26. Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n  27. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 500 \u00b5l of FACS buffer.\r\n  28. Repeat the steps described in Section E-2 with replacing CPM\nhigh\nprogenitor cells by EpCAM\n+\nSFTPC\n+\ncells. \r\n   \r\n\n\nF.  Induction of alveolar stem cells WITHOUT fibroblasts\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPreparation\r\n\n\n\u00b7 The following medium should be prepared before use.\r\n\n\nFibroblast-free \\(FF) alveolarization medium: \r\n\n\nAlveolarization medium \\(described in Section E-2), CHIR99021 \\(3 \u00b5M), SB431542 \\(10 \u00b5M) and Y27632 \\(10 \u00b5M). \r\n\n\nNOTE: Add CHIR99021, SB431542 and Y27632 on the day of use.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProcedure\r\n\n\n1. Suspend 2.0 \u00d7 10\n5\nCPM\nhigh\nprogenitor cells prepared in Section D in 250 \u00b5l of FF alveolarization medium. \r\n  2. Add the cell suspension onto a non-adherent surface 96-well plate \\(Kuraray, SQ 200 100 NA). \r\n  3. On day 2, collect cell aggregates into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube by gently pipetting and aspirate using P-1000 tip.\r\n  4. Wash the wells with FACS buffer once and collect the remained cell aggregates. \r\n  5. Spin down the cell aggregates for 3 minutes using a tabletop personal centrifuge. \r\n  6. Remove the supernatant using P-1000 tip. \r\n  7. Remove the remained supernatant carefully using P-200 tip as possible. \r\n  CAUTION: Too much remained supernatant can cause the subsequent steps to fail. \r\n\n\nCAUTION: Remove the supernatant quickly, or the pellet will crumble.\r\n\n\n8. Resuspend the cell aggregates in 20 \u00b5l of precooled Matrigel and place onto a well of 12-well cell culture plate quickly. \r\n  CAUTION: Use P-20 tips and precooled Matrigel. If not, Matrigel will rapidly clot inside the tips. \r\n\n\n9. Incubate the cell culture plate for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. \r\n  Add 1 ml of FF alveolarization medium and change the medium on day 2, 4 and 6."

Although we previously developed a method of 3D co-culture differentiation of CPM<sup>+</sup> cells with fetal human lung fibroblasts to induce alveolar stem cells<sup>6</sup>, the induction efficiency had been < 20% and it was difficult to maintain the alveolar stem cells for a long term. In this protocol, we added a step for preconditioning NKX2.1<sup>+</sup> cells toward alveolar stem cell differentiation and established a method of their passages. Moreover, we also developed a method of fibroblast-free induction of SFTPC<sup>+</sup> alveolar stem cells in order to avoid the usage of human fetal lung fibroblasts.  This protocol accompanies Yamamoto et al \\(10.1038/nmeth.4448), Nature Methods, published online October 2, 2017.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Corrections have been made to this protocol since it was published**\r\n\n\nIn the version of this protocol initially published, the concentration of 8-Br-cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and KGF in \u201cAlveolarization medium\u201d described\u3000in\u3000\u201cE-2\u201d section\u3000of \u201cProcedure\u201d was incorrectly typed; \r\n\n\n8-Br-cAMP \\(it was 100 nM; the correct units are \u03bcM), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine \\(it was 100 nM; the correct units are \u03bcM) and KGF \\(it was 100 ng/ml; the correct concentration is 10 ng/ml).",
