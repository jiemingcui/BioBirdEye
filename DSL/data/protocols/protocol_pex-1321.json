            "content": "<p><strong>Background and rationale</strong></p><p>Pediatric patients with cancer and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia are at great risk to develop severe and potentially life threatening infections. Initially, fever is often the only clinical detectable sign of such an infection. Therefore, fever in neutropenia is treated as an emergency, including hospitalization, start of intravenous empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and close monitoring.</p><p>Several clinical decision rules have been established to distinguish between severe and less severe infections, based on the patient\u2019s history, clinical appearance and laboratory signs [1, 2], but with the exception of fever, vital signs are hardly explored. Delay of diagnosis and treatment can result in increased mortality [3], more intensive treatment [4] and more adverse events [5]. Time from hospital admission to antibiotics has been shown to influence clinical outcomes [5].</p><p>Wearable devices (WD) are already frequently used by athletes to monitor their activities and vital signs. Those devices are becoming smaller, more powerful and sophisticated and allow continuous recording of health data nearly everywhere and under any condition. Also in medical settings, WD are increasingly used for continuous measurements of patients\u2019 health data [6, 7]. Non-invasive on-skin wearable monitoring devices offer a broad set of health data that is recorded continuously.</p><p>It is hypothesized that continuous health data monitoring will provide more detailed information, and an more exact representation of the patient\u2019s health status than discrete measurements.</p><p>Specifically it has been shown, that infections trigger changes of vital-signs very early in their course. For example heart-rate variability has been identified to change before clinical symptoms are detectable in neonates with sepsis [8] and in adults who underwent bone marrow transplant [9, 10]. Using a WD therefore opens the possibility to identify health data patterns that might be used as an additional diagnostic tool or a tool predicting imminent fever or infection in the near future. This may lead to earlier diagnosis and shorter time to antibiotics in patients at high risk for severe infection and the distinction from patients at lower risk.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Primary objective</strong></p><p>To assess the feasibility of continuous monitoring of heart rate in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer using the WD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Secondary objectives</strong></p><p>Secondary objectives are related to:</p><p>A. Further feasibility aspects</p><p>B. Comparison of continuously recorded data with results of discrete measurements performed for clinical routine care</p><p>C. Exploration for specific patterns in continuously recorded data before and during episodes of fever and infection</p>"

            "content": "Project design\nIn this study the WD will be studied in the patients for 14 days. A total of 20 patients will be included, including at least 4 patients <6 years. As this is a feasibility study, a formal sample size calculation has not been performed. However, this sample size allows to assess the primary outcome with clinically meaningful precision and to roughly assess the primary outcome in the group of patients <6 years of age.\nProject population, inclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chemotherapy treatment because of any malignancy, expected to last \u22651 month at time of recruitment for \t\t myelosuppressive therapy; or at least one cycle of myeloablative therapy requiring autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Age from 1 month to 17.99 years at time of recruitment\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Written informed consent from patients and/or parents\nExclusion criteria:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Local skin diseases prohibiting wearing of the WD.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Denied written informed consent from patients and/or parents\nPhases of the study:\nRecruitment, screening and informed consent procedure\nThis study will be conducted at the Inselspital, Bern University Hospital. Patients will be screened for eligibility and recruited by a study investigator or treating physician. Patient recruitment will stop when the aimed number of twenty patients is reached. No payment or compensation will be given to study patients or their parents. The investigators will explain to the parents/legal representative and the patient if applicable, the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits and any discomfort it may entail. The participation in the study is voluntary and the participants may withdraw from the study at any time. The formal consent of the parents/legal representative and the patient if applicable, using the approved consent form, must be obtained before the patient is submitted to any study procedure.\nStudy visit\nThe study visit will be done during a routine outpatient visit, or during hospitalization. One of the study investigators will distribute the WD, the charger, and if needed a mobile phone to the parents or patient. Parents and/or patients, with no suitable mobile phone, will be provided with a phone for the study time. This phone will not be usable for other purposes than data transfer. Basic characteristics will be assessed at the study visit.\nThe WD is fitted using body size-appropriate elastic bands and the fitting is controlled by the investigator. Parents and patients if applicable, will be instructed in the handling and charging of the WD. For instructions, the pictures and descriptions provided by the manufacturer on the website, in the \u201cinstructions for use\u201d handbook and the information in the study information form will be used. The WD will be put on the upper arm or, if anatomically reasonable, on the upper leg.\nStudy period\nThere will be no additional examinations or procedures performed for this study, specifically no additional discrete measurements of vital signs will be undertaken unless the clinically indicated measurements. Daily activities and temperature measurements if taken during outpatient stay will be recorded on case report forms (CRF) by parents and/or by patients. Questionnaires will be used for the assessment of WD acceptance, side effects and reasons not to wear the device.\nParents, patients and members of the treating staff will not be able to access the continuously measured data, in order to avoid any influence on clinical decision making due to these data.\nDuring the whole study period, one of the investigators will do a daily data-check, to see if data is recorded properly or not. If no data is recorded or if there are signs for reduced data quality, the parents and/or patients will be contacted by phone. Possible reasons for non-recording or reduced data quality will be discussed on the phone and instructions will be given to parents and/or patients.\nDuring the study period, parents and/or patients will be in charge for battery charging (approx.2 hours each day) and data upload via mobile phone app. Parents and/or patients will fill out a CRF daily and note time of charging, connection to the mobile phone, reasons for not wearing the WD, any side effects, activities and temperature measurements, if applicable.\nDuring hospitalization treating staff will perform discrete measurements as clinically indicated and note them in the patient chart. Parents and/or patients will continue to fill out the CRF daily. The charts will be assessed by the investigators to match the recorded data with the data from the WD.\nThe study period ends regularly for each patient after the planned period of 14 days, in case of intensive care unit admission or at the day of death from any cause, unrelated to the study.\nFollow-up\nFollow-up period covers 24hours after the end of the study period. The respective follow-up interview by phone or if applicable during a routine hospital visit will take place 1 to 3 days after the end of the study period."
