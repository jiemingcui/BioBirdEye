            "content": "MicroRNA \\(miRNA) are short \\(~22 nucleotide) non-protein-coding, evolutionary conserved RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level 1-3. The number of miRNAs in human genome is estimated to be over 1000 and at least 30% of all genes are under their regulation 4. The cellular processes involved include differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation and stress response 1, 2, 5, 6. Aberrant expression of miRNA is involved in tumorigenesis. Tumor suppressor and oncogenic actions of miRNA have been described 7-9. In many malignancies, miRNA rich regions are susceptible to genetic alterations \\(fragile sites, deletions, amplifications) 10, 11. Methods used for the detection and quantification of miRNA are northern blotting, real-time RT-PCR, and microarrays for genome wide expression profiling 12-14. The main limitation of these methods in cancer research is their inability to discriminate miRNA from neoplastic and other cells \\(connective tissue, vessels, inflammatory cells etc). In situ hybridization \\(ISH) is a powerful tool that provides information on gene expression in a heterogeneous cell population at cellular and sub-cellular level.  Due to the small size and varied gene expression pattern of miRNAs, ISH for them is technically very challenging.  However, the use of locked nucleic acid \\(LNA) probes where nucleotide bases are modified markedly increases the thermal stability between probe and target and also provides excellent mismatch-discrimination 15, 16. LNA probes are reported to dramatically increase the efficiency, sensitivity and specificity of the hybridization signals.  LNA based ISH protocols for detection of miRNA in fresh frozen and paraffin sections has been reported 17-20. However, published protocols are not optimized for performing chromogenic ISH on paraffin embedded tissue microarray \\(TMA) consisting of heterogeneous collection of tissue samples which has undergone different formalin fixation procedures. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTMA \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nToday, TMAs are widely used in research of molecular pathogenesis of many types of neoplasias 21. With TMAs expression of multiple targets on RNA or protein level in up to 1,000 tissue samples can be examined in single experiment. Unlike mRNA, miRNAs are relatively stable and tolerates molecular cross-linking caused by formalin used in fixation of routine surgical tissue samples17, 20, 22, 23, which makes TMAs prepared from archival tumor samples a potentially powerful tool in miRNA research.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProteinase K treatment\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor optimizing the hybridization conditions different buffers and various concentrations of proteinase K were tested. It turned out that 10 \u00b5g/ml proteinase K concentration was required. A crucial factor for successful hybridization is addition of EDTA in the proteinase buffer. Our protocol also gave successful signals when applied to the paraffin sections of various tissues like ovarian cancer, breast cancer and gastric cancer. Different probes and tissues gave excellent results with our protocol \\(Fig.1-2.) Many probes were tested and shown to work in TMA of 98 cases of serous ovarian carcinoma. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIntra-tumor heterogeneity issue\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDue to genetic evolution and microenvironmental heterogeneity mRNA and protein expression levels may largely vary in different parts of tumors, which may limit the usefulness of TMAs. To test the intra-tumor heterogeneity of miRNA expression we prepared TMAs consisted of four samples taken from various parts of same tumor. Our TMA consisted of 98 cases of serous ovarian carcinoma. In 12 cases \\(12/98) the four samples showed heterogeneous staining pattern, indicating the need of multiple samples while using TMAs.  In five cases the miRNA-ISH was not analyzable due to loss of tissue or lack of carcinoma cells. Thus in 81/98 \\(82.6%) of cases the result was conclusive.  In many occasions the signal in carcinoma cells was weak/negative while the stromal cells were strongly positive highlighting the need of miRNA-ISH complementing the results obtained by other more quantitative means. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDetection methodology\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn order to enhance the signal intensity specially in the cases were the low expression of the miRNA was expected several colorimetric antibody based  kits  were tested \\(Power Vision + TM Poly HRP IHC detection kit \\(PV6104),  EnVision\u2122 G|2 System/AP, Rabbit/Mouse \\(K5355), and EnzMet\u2122 HRP Detection Kit for IHC / ISH\\(6001). In our experience none of the above mentioned kit gave successful in situ signals."

Probes were diluted and stored according to published protocol 18 and manufactures instruction. Pre-hybridizations and hybridizations were performed at temperature 20-25\u00b0C below the Tm of the given LNA probe. Working conditions and the efficiency of the in situ hybridizations were determined by using both positive \\(U6, miRNA known to be ubiquitously expressed in most of the tissues) and negative \\(scramble, has no homology to any known miRNA/ mRNA sequence) control probes\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHybridization Mix 10ml: \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAccording to published protocol 18 \\(To 1.8 ml DEPC-treated water add 5ml of ultra pure 50% formamide, 2.5ml of 20x SSC, 500\u03bcl of 10 ug/\u03bcl yeast t-RNA, 200 \u03bcl of 50x Denhardt\u2019s solution for a total volume of 10ml.

Here we present protocol for fast and sensitive chromogenic miRNA-in situ hybridization \\(ISH) for analyzing paraffin embedded tissue microarray \\(TMA).  This protocol is based on combination of locked nucleic acid \\(LNA) probes and chromogenic detection system. Particular conditions for proteinase treatment are a prerequisite for specific and sensitive staining and in this protocol proteinase K treatment for TMA was optimised This protocol gave successful signals with various probes and tissues, thereby enabling the miRNA detection in wide range of cancers using TMA.",
