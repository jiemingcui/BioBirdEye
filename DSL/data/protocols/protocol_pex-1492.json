            "content": "Fascia is a band&nbsp;portion of connective tissue. It surrounds any muscle and organ in the body. When fascia tissue becomes too rigid, it loses its pliability, making it impossible for the fascia to reach its maximum length.<sup>3</sup> The increase in fascia tightness contributes to a decline in fascia stability. Reduced joint motion capability, muscle strength, and soft tissue extensibility result from increased fascia tightness. <sup>4</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The plantar fascia originates from medial aspect of calcaneus tuberosity and inserts into the (dorsal aspect) proximal phalanges and the sheaths of flexor tendon and is formed from collagen fibres<sup>5</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The middle, medial, and lateral portions of the plantar fascia are made up of dense connective tissue.<sup>6</sup>. The fascia system provides static and dynamic support to the arch of the foot while also transmitting forces between the heel and forefoot.<sup>7</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plantar fasciitis is a very common foot ailment.<sup>8</sup> It is caused by collagen degeneration of the plantar fascia and the surrounding perifascial structures<sup>1</sup>. Also known as jogger's heel, plantar heel pain, or plantar fasciopathy.<sup>.9</sup></p><p>A sharp insidious pain under the heel and along the medial border of the plantar fascia up to its insertion at the calcaneus are signs of plantar fasciitis.<sup>7</sup> Pain is unbearable in the morning, for the first few steps out of bed, after a long time of inactivity, or at the start of a workout.<sup>10</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It can be caused by something that puts mechanical strain on the plantar fascia. Intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors may be distinguished.<sup>3</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Excessive weight , flatfoot, pes cavus, decreased range of ankle dorsiflexion, Gastrocnemius, Soleus and underlying muscle tightness and/or weakness affecting the patient.<sup>11</sup> Environmental and workout factors include running on raw floors, walking without footwear, abrupt growth in running pace and/or length, and sustained walking/staying.<sup>12</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the considerations involved in the development of PF was suggested to reduce the dorsiflexion angle of the ankle in association with calf muscle tightness.<sup>13</sup> The most common cause of biomechanical changes in PF is calf muscle tightness. During the stance process of gait, it will result in increased tensile force on the plantar fascia.<sup>14</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Orthotics-night splint, Rest, silicone heel cups, massage, myofascial release and positional release therapy have all been advocated in the past as physiotherapy care strategies.<sup>15</sup> U.S., phonophoresis, laser, iontophoresis, cryotherapy and contrast baths have all been used as electrotherapy modalities in the past.<sup>16</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To counteract the harmful effects of muscle exercise, deep percussive massage is often used. The physiological responses to the mechanical stimulation of massage have been linked to beneficial effects, which may help you prepare for or recover from exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;There have been three Proposed massage reactions:</p><p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhanced permeation of the semipermeable membrane enclosing the cytoplasm of a cell to toxic products that gather within cells;</p><p>&nbsp;2) increased blood pressure for the reduction of toxic substances and the supply of oxygen and other nutrients;</p><p>&nbsp;3) the influence of massage on sensory receptors in muscles.<sup>17</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Percussive Therapy is a relatively new technique that uses a mechanical system, such as the Theragun, to provide percussive massage.<sup>2</sup> The application of theragun activates the Golgi tendon organ, which triggers a relaxation response from the higher middle, lowering calf muscle stress, improving circulation and nutrition to the tissue, and reducing tightness and improving flexibility. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vibrations also reduce pain perception through the pain gait theory process.<sup>18</sup></p><p>Muscle stretching, are also used to ease symptoms during this transitional period. A new systematic review of randomized trials looked at the effect of calf muscle stretching on the ankle range of motion and found that stretching increases the ankle range of motion by a limited but statistically important amount.<sup>8</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Due to the strain exerted on the plantar fascia by the calf muscle during standing and ambulation, this improvement will help to reduce the effects of plantar heel pain.<sup>19</sup> </p><p>Calf muscle stretches are often recommended in the hopes of increasing ankle dorsiflexion and alleviating the symptoms of these disorders.<sup>20</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The stretch-induced strength loss theory proposed by Nelson et al. in 200128 states that when muscle length is shortened for an extended period of time, sarcomere length shortens. Since this isn't the right duration for muscle contraction, it just produces mild isometric stress. Stretching exercise is thought to improve muscle-tendon unit acquiescence, allowing for greater sarcomere shortening during isometric contraction.<sup>21</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stretching exercises for the calf muscle and plantar fascia are likely to be linked to improved muscle strength in all of the testing muscles. <sup>14</sup></p>"

A sharp insidious pain under the heel and along the medial border of the plantar fascia up to its insertion at the calcaneus are signs of plantar fasciitis. The most common cause of biomechanical changes in PF is calf muscle tightness. Percussive Therapy is a relatively new technique that uses a mechanical system, such as the Theragun, to provide percussive massage.(17) Therefore, this Research will explore the current literature regarding the effect of massage gun device on Pain, Range of Motion, Muscle Strength and Functional Outcomes in Patients with Plantar Fasciitis.</p><p>Methodology:</p><p>In the study, 48 patients diagnosed with Plantar fasciitis will be enrolled for a week. One group will receive conventional therapy and the other group will receive a percussive therapy treatment via Theragun for a week. Pain, flexibility, ROM and Muscle strength will be evaluated using to standard technique.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>The goal of this Interventional study is to examine the impact of Percussive Massage Therapy in Patients with Plantar Fasciitis. The study findings would help prospective patients with Plantar Fasciitis, which may include a newly designed method of rehabilitation.</p><p><br></p><p>The clinical trial registry-India(CTRI) registration number for this trial is CTRI/2021/05/033460.</p>",
