This may be a result, in part, of the heterogeneity that exists within stem cell cultures. We have generated a new stem cell medium PRIMO Plus, which biases cells towards mesodermal differentiation without losing pluripotency. The cells can be maintained over multiple passaged and when cultured in this medium appear to be trapped at a relevant development stage on a mesoderm differentiation trajectory that impact upon their differentiation outcome. We hope that this medium could be used as a tool in both improving the differentiation of hPSCs towards mesodermal derivatives but also to investigate the basic biological principles behind biased sub-states, the exit from pluripotency and the commitment to differentiation.</p>"

Our E8 was made in house with a recipe adapted from Chen et al, 2011, although commercially available version can be used instead. One key difference in the in-house media from the recipe published by Chen et al, 2011 is the replacement of standard glutamine with GlutaMax (Thermofisher).\u00a0Glutamax is a thermostable form of glutamine, which is bound to alanine to increase stability.\u00a0Large batches of 50X E8 supplements were prepared and frozen as 10ml aliquots at -20\u00b0C. Defrosted 10ml aliquots were added to 490ml of DMEM/F12 without glutamine and filtered using a CytoOne Bottle Top Filtration Unit 0.2\u00b5M filter.\nE8 Composition:\n1 litre of 50X concentrate: DMEM/F12 (Used neat to make mixture up to 1 litre), L-ascorbic acid (3200mg/L), Sodium selenium (700\u00b5g/L), Insulin (970mg/L), NaHCO\n3\n(27.15g/L), Transferrin (535mg/L), Glutamax (50X, 500ml), FGF2 (5mg/L) and TGFB1 (100\u00b5g/L).\n1 litre of E8: DMEM/F12 (Used neat to make mixture up to 1 litre), L-ascorbic acid (64mg/L), Sodium selenium (14\u00b5g/L), Insulin (19.4mg/L), NaHCO\n3\n(543mg/L), Transferrin (10.7mg/L), Glutamax (1X, 10ml/L), FGF2 (100\u00b5g/L) and TGFB1 (2\u00b5g/L).\nPRIMO Plus medium:\nPreparations:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CHIR99021: resuspend the powder in DMSO at 10mM.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IWP-2: resuspend the powder in DMSO at 5mM.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cholesterol:\u00a0resuspend the powder in 100% ethanol at 20mM.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LPA: resuspend the powder in PBS with 0.1% Fatty acid free BSA at 381\u00b5M.\nPreparation of 40ml 5X stock\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissolve 400mg of BSA (1% in final volume) in 5ml of E8 media at 37\u02dac.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add ~0.5ml (amount for 4.8 \u00b5M in 40ml) of LPA and incubate for 5 minutes.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 40\u00b5l of 20mM Cholesterol (20\u00b5M in 40ml) and incubate for a further 5 minutes.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add ~34.5ml of E8.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filter sterilise with a 0.22\u00b5M filter.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Freeze or make smaller aliquots and freeze at -20\u02dac\nPreparation of PRIMO Plus:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dilute 5X stock 1 in 5 with E8 media, ie 10ml of stock with 40ml of E8.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add CHIR99021 at 3\u00b5M.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add IWP-2 at 1\u00b5M.\nPRIMO Plus Composition:\n5x stock: Desired mL of E8 as basal, Fatty Acid Free BSA (1%), Cholesterol (20\u00b5M), and LPA (4.8\u00b5M).\nPRIMO Plus complete: Desired mL of E8 as basal, Fatty Acid Free BSA (0.2%), Cholesterol (4\u00b5M), LPA (0.96\u00b5M), CHIR99021 (3\u00b5M) and IWP-2 (1\u00b5M).\nCell culture:\nPreparing Vitronectin Flasks (*can be substituted with Geltrex (Thermofisher #A1413201) following manufacturers instructions):\n1. Remove Vitronectin (ThermoFisher, A14700)\u00a0Aliquot from -80\u00b0C Freezer and allow to thaw at room temperature.\n2. Dilute Vitronectin at 1:100 in 1X PBS.\n3. Coat the surface of a Tissue Culture flask with Vitronectin (3ml per T25, 2ml per T12.5) and leave at room temperature for minimum of 1 hour.\nFollowing incubation at room temperature, flasks are now ready for use or alternatively can be stored in the fridge and used within 2 weeks. If stored in the fridge prior to use flasks must be left to return to room temperature for a minimum of 1 hour.\nPassaging hES cells using ReleSR (Stem Cell Technologies, # 05873):\n4. Aspirate Vitronectin and replace with PRIMO PLUS; 3ml per T25/ 1.5ml per T12.5, place flasks in the incubator until cells harvested.\n5. Remove media from confluent flask of hPSCs and wash gently with 1X PBS.\n6. Add 1ml ReleSR to the bottom of flask, rock the flask back and forth to ensure all cells have been coated, incubate for ~20 seconds at RT.\n7. Tilt the flask sufficiently that ReleSR pools in one of the bottom corners of the flask and aspirate away the ReleSR.\n8. Incubate cells for 2-4 minutes at room temperature \u2013\nIncubation period is dependent on cells line and colony size and should be adjusted appropriately.\nFor large colonies the incubation time will have to be increased. Cultures on Geltrex usually require longer incubation.\n9. Inactivate ReleSR by adding 2ml of\nPRIMO PLUS medium\nand slowly rocking back and forth, cells can be encouraged to detach by tapping the flask \u2013\navoid very aggressive tapping of the flask which will encourage any differentiated cells to also detach.\n10. Check cells under the microscope to assess colony size\n11. Resuspend pellet in appropriate volume of PRIMO Plus medium and distribute into prepared flasks as relevant for the desired splitting ratio. Normally passaged as small clumps using ReleSR at a ratio of 1:6, sometimes 1:12, every 3-4 days (optimal split ratios and growth periods will have to be established experimentally for different PSC lines).\n12. Final volume of media in flasks or plates should be kept to a low volume, for a T25 this should be~ 3ml.\u00a0Higher volumes result in poor plating efficiency.\n13. Place cells into 37\u02dac 5% CO\n2\nIncubator for culture.\n14. Medium must be replaced daily because of LPAs short half-life.\n15. Cells should be passaged again before reaching high confluency (over 90%), dense areas will lead to differentiation.\nImportant Notes: The medium is delicately balanced, over feeding can push the cells towards differentiation but under feeding can do the same as the cells degrade the LPA. We suggest to have cells growing in E8 first and allow them to reach high confluency (~80%) then passage with standard ReleSR technique into PRIMO Plus medium.\u00a0Feed so that you see the visible colour change in the media the following day. For T25s we would normally passage into 3-4ml, then over the days increasing the volume by 1-2mls up to 10ml the day before passage."

This can appear as flat, spread and distended colonies, these should compact over the days of culture, with colonies appearing rounder and with shinier edges under the microscope. After the line has adapted to the medium, colonies favour the more compact morphology post-passage but the flat colonies can sometimes still be seen. When differentiation occurs, it has appeared as small, spiky, fibroblast like cells that do not maintain a colony morphology. This can normally be removed with accurate ReleSR passaging to leave the differentiated cells in the flask. Decreasing the incubation time of ReleSR can be helpful to achieve this clean-up.</p><p><br></p><p>Assessing cells in mesoderm biased state:</p><p>Surface marker analysis:</p><p>Cells can be harvested and assessed for pluripotency associated surface marker expression by flow cytometry.
