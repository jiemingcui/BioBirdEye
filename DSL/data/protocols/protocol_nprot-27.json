            "content": "Following injury, the adult mammalian central nervous system has limited capacity to repair. Transected nerve fibers do not spontaneously re-grow, due in part to myelin-associated neurite growth inhibitors such as Nogo-A. After section of the corticospinal \\(CS) tract in adult rats, neutralizing Nogo-A with monoclonal antibodies leads to enhancement of axonal re-growth and compensatory sprouting, accompanied by increased motor recovery. The neutralization of Nogo-A represents a promising approach for therapy after lesion if its enhancement of functional recovery can be transposed to primates. The aim of our study was to extend these data in rodents to macaque monkeys and assess whether neutralization of Nogo-A enhances motor recovery from spinal lesion in primates."

The second antibody used, mAb hNogo-A is directed against the Nogo-A specific region of the human Nogo-A sequence. Both antibodies recognize primate Nogo-A monospecifically on Western blots \\[2]. Both antibodies increase neurite outgrowth in vitro and penetrate deeply the CNS in vivo in monkeys \\[3]. The antibodies were purified as IgGs and concentrated to 3.7-10 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline \\(PBS).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Control antibodies**\r\n\n\nPurified IgG of a mouse mAb directed against wheat auxin \\(AMS Biotechnology, Oxon/UK) was used as control antibody.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Muscimol \\(GABA agonist)** for reversible inactivation of motor cortex \\(see Kermadi et al. 1997 for more information).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Biotinylated Dextran Amine** \\(=BDA; Molecular Probes) used as anterograde anatomical tracer."

Therefore, a survival time of 60 days was considered here.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA double-blind procedure is required \\(the experimenter testing the monkeys behaviorally should not know which antibody was infused, e.g. anti-Nogo-A or control.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCheck body weight of the animals daily."
