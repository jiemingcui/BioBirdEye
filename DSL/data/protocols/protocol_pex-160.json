            "content": "<p>Mouse intestinal organoids grow from single cells over days to form 3D structures composed of crypts and villi containing all cell types present in the mouse intestine<sup>1</sup>. They represent an example of self-organization where the different cell types occupy precise locations and establish spatial functional relationships with each other. To achieve such a level of organization, single cells undergo a series of morphological and functional changes relaying on gene expression networks, cell migration and cell-cell interactions.</p><p>Comprehensive investigation of such processes requires a systematic approach combining different experimental techniques. Moreover, the ability to investigate hundreds or thousands of organoids in parallel is fundamental for systems that present an intrinsic degree of variability. Here, we report a workflow to study intestinal organoid development by immunofluorescence, high-throughput microscopy and RNA extraction. Our protocol describes a droplet organoid culture method on 96 well-plate format compatibles with multiple rounds of multiplexing immunofluorescence staining<sup>2</sup>and optical clearing<sup>3</sup>. The same platform can be used for RNA extraction. This approach is particularly powerful to characterize the development of organoids that grow over several days and allows to link morphological changes and cell interactions to the underlying gene regulatory networks.</p><p>Many in-vitro model systems are now emerging which can be used to study self-organization starting from few cells<sup>4,5,6</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The protocol presented here is not limited to intestinal organoids and can be adapted to other in-vitro organoid systems. We believe that a systematic and quantitative analysis of such multi-cellular systems will be essential for interpretation of experiments across different laboratories, especially when used in perturbation experiments and for personalized medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

            "content": "Organoid cultures prior to time course experiments\nOrganoids are cultured in 50 \u00b5l/well of 1:1 Matrigel/culture maintenance medium mix within wells of 24 well-plates and in the presence of 500 \u00b5l of culture maintenance medium. Organoids are split mechanically every 5-7 days.\n\ufeff\nOrganoid time course experiment from single cells\nSample preparation and single cell seeding\n1.\nRemove the medium from the wells and collect Matrigel droplets containing organoids with ice cold PBS into a falcon tube (use 0.5 ml of PBS per well). Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 400 rcf and 4\u00b0C to pellet the organoids\nNote:\nNumber of wells to collect depends on the type of experiment conducted (number of replicates and number of plates to prepare). For a normal time course experiment, we usually collect between 12 and 24 wells\n2.\nDiscard supernatant and re-suspend pellet in Tryple (add 100 \u00b5l of Tryple with 10 \u00b5M of Rock inhibitor for each collected well)\n3.\nIncubate 20 min at 37\u00b0C with harsh pipetting every five minutes\n4.\nAddDMEM/F-12 (~3 times the amount of used Tryple) and centrifugefor 5 min at 400 rcf and 4\u00b0C\n5.\nDiscard supernatant and re-suspend in 0.5 ml of cold PBS (PBS plus 10 \u00b5M Rock inhibitor)\n6.\nFilter cell suspension through a 30 \u00b5m cell strainer directly into a FACS sorting tube\n7.\nKeep samples on ice until sorting (ideally this should be done within 30 min)\n8.\nPrepare a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube with 200 \u00b5l of ENR medium (add 10 \u00b5M Rock inhibitor to ENR medium) to collect the sample (collection tube, store on ice)\n9.\nFACS sort single alive cells into prepared collection tube\n10.\nAfter sorting, centrifuge collection tube for 5 min at 800 rcf and 4\u00b0C\n11\n. Discard supernatant carefully, re-suspend in 1:1 ratio of ENR medium and Matrigel\nNote:\nDilute pellet with a 1:1 ratio of ENR medium and Matrigel to obtain a final concentration of ~3000 cells/5 \u00b5l droplet. Depending on batch to batch variability of the medium compounds, organoid forming efficiency can show some variation. For this reason, adjustment of seeding densities might help (usually in a range between 2500 and 5000 cells/5 \u00b5l droplet). A final density of 100-200 organoid/well represents a good number for further analysis\n12.\nSeed 5 \u00b5l droplet of the prepared cell suspension for each well of a 96 well-plate\nNote:\nNumber of plates and number of wells per plate to prepare depends on the experiment. Usually we prepare 6 plates with multiple wells containing organoids which we fix after 3h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h and 120h after plating\n13.\nIncubate the plate for 15-20 min at 37\u00b0Cin an incubator to let the droplets solidify.\n14.\nAdd 100 \u00b5l/well of ENR medium supplemented with 20% Wnt3a-CM, 10\u00b5M of Rock inhibitor and 3\u00b5M of CHIR99021\nRemark:\nIf FACS sorting is not possible, after step 6, count the cells and continue with step 10 to seed them.

Intestinal organoids, in particular, can develop from a single cell into a fully-grown structure that contains most of the cell types, patterns, and morphogenetic properties of the adult intestine. Here we present a protocol for high-throughput organoid culture in multi-well plate format combined with high content immunofluorescence imaging and RNA extraction. Our protocol allows recording and analysis of thousands of organoids during several days of development.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",
