Our aim, guided by standards of excellence, ethics and equity, remains to guide healthcare personnel in neurosurgical practice in limited-resource communities, reaching the unreachable, in low- and middle-income countries.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>\u201c</strong><em>It may be part of human nature to err, but it is also part of human nature to create solutions, find better alternatives and meet the challenges ahead\u201d (Kohn LT, Corrigan J and Donaldson MS)</em></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>CRANIOPLASTY: BASIC CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p><p>Neurological disorders constitute a large and increasing share of the global burden of diseases studies by the WHO, with much of this burden originating in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Feigin <em>et al</em>., 2019). Along with the categorization of neurological diseases, which account for as much of 25% of global death and disability, massive stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), brain tumors, congenital deformities and gunshot wounds frequently require large decompressive craniectomy (DC) to reduce intracranial pressure and cerebral edema. For patients who survive, subsequent cranioplasty (i.e., cranial repair) aims to provide cerebral protection, improve blood perfusion and cerebrospinal fluid (CBF) dynamic restoring function and esthetics (see reviews by Hutchinson <em>et al</em>., 2019;, laccarino <em>et al</em>., 2020, 2021). However, varying shapes, sizes and complexities of defects observed in these patients present reconstructive challenges dispensing a customized solution to each individual case (Gil <em>et al.,</em> 2019). As a result, cranial prostheses production is often pricy, becoming out of reach to patient populations that do not have the resources to defray the costs and that are not funded by public health systems in resource-deficient countries. Therefore, despite advancements in bioengineering and medicine, patients in resource-deficient countries continue to face wait times of years \u2013 or stand in line over their lifetime - to repair their skull to relieve psychological drawbacks and to increase both mental and social performances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For centuries, several materials have been tested to repair cranial defects, ranging from coconut shells, allogenic and xenogenic bone grafts, metals to biosynthetic materials, such as ceramics and resins (Alkhaibary A <em>et al.,</em> 2020; Aydin <em>et al</em>., 2001; Khader and Towler, 2016). The characteristics of an ideal prosthesis are resistance to mechanical deformation and to infection, inability to cause inflammatory responses, chemical inertness, non-carcinogenicity, nonconductive to heat/cold, capacity to be sterilized and to be molded into the desired shape, lightweight and low cost. Although there is no \u2018silver bullet\u2019, low-cost intraoperatively produced Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement, approved by regulatory agencies worldwide, has been increasingly used in cranial repair with good biocompatibility, and great cosmetic and functional results, presenting performance similar To other available materials and little related implant complications when done with proper techniques (Giese <em>et al</em>, 2019; Gil <em>et al</em>., 2019; Khader and Towler, 2016; Las <em>et al.</em>, 2021). Because PMMA has strength comparable to the bone, our safety design in the current protocol assures mechanical and impact properties to be a little weaker than the bone tissue around it to prevent fracturing the skull after a subsequent episode of TBI (<em>see </em>Procedures). Thus, customized 3D PMMA cranial prostheses offers a greater cost-effective strategy for both patients and society, reducing operative time and presenting a maximum gain in overall well-being per unit of expenditure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here, we provide step-by-step instructions to help carry out TC imaging, computational workflow, operational additive manufacturing- and intraoperatively-procedures to perform cranioplasty using a PMMA customized implant. A list of reagents, equipment and troubleshooting is provided to ensure that prostheses manufacturing is replicated in a strongly-consistent manner on multiple machines and/or by groups with limited-resources.&nbsp;</p>"

The possibility to establish a nearly wasteless 3D printing process is within reach.<strong> </strong>However,<strong> </strong>creating a successful Additive Manufacturing Unit that will not fail, while keeping the process cost-effective is challenging if you do not have the proper structure. Too often, engineers must scrap multiple parts before they find the optimal build orientation and support strategy. For beginners, the initial investment required for producing a product using 3D manufacturing processes may exceed that of traditional methods. But, again, the investment on 3D printing is booming because this technology has the potential to resolve the \u201cscale-scope\u201d dilemma on the cost side and because there are no penalties associated with a higher degree of product variety. Below (<strong>see Table 6 - <em>Suppl. Files</em></strong>), we provide a list of basic equipment and reagents required for 3D printing of cranial prostheses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Table 6</strong> illustrates a quotation inquiry of 3D Systems for a basic infrastructure composed of an additive manufacturing equipment, related peripherals and basic consumables. Substitute products with similar technical aspects, at a lower cost or value added benefits, may be offered by other companies like EOS, Germany.

In this case, the answer is simple: it depends on what branch of healthcare you are in, ranging from a few to a large number of patients. 3D printers may cost up to $1M. However, there are plenty of efficient printers in the mid-range ($100,000 - $250,000), which suits well mid-size medical groups with prostheses manufacturing needs. To work out your ROI (\u2018<em>return on investment\u2019</em>), take the current market prostheses costs, the potential number of patients that could benefit from this solution, and subtract the cost to print the corresponding parts to determine the savings. Take the price of the printer, divide by the cost of savings to determine the number of printed parts needed to pay off a specific printer.

            "content": "Our protocol provides clear, step-by-step instructions to help healthcare professionals carry out routine cranioplasty procedures, ranging from CT imaging acquisition, PMMA prostheses manufacturing to intraoperative flap implantation (\nFig. 1\n). Given that a manufacturing facility is capable of printing a significant number of customized cranial prostheses without retooling, and that each printing can be performed without additional cost, establishment of a single central Manufacturing Additive Unit in low-income economies could provide effective assistance (cost-effectiveness analysis) in a timely fashion to an increasing number of patients in need of cranioplasty procedures.\n** Figure 1 **\nThe constructive guidelines comprise 3 phases which are covered in the following manner:\nPhase #1:\nCT Imaging\n; Phase #2:\n3D manufacturing\n; and, Phase #3:\nIntraoperative molding, fitting and adjustment of PMMA prostheses.\nPhase 1: CT imaging\n\u00b7\nPatient Population\nWe performed a review of 54 consecutive patients undergoing CT-based, low-cost, customized intraoperative PMMA cranioplasty implants over a 26-month period (Jan 2019 - Feb 2021) at Hospital da Restaura\u00e7\u00e3o (HR), Recife, Pernambuco, and at Hospital Municipal Miguel Couto (HMMC), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Ethical and Institutional review board approvals (CAAE: 79457617.9.0000.5198 [HR/PE]; CAAE: 96263418.0.0000.5279 [HMMC/RJ]) and patient or caregiver consent for data release for scientific purpose and photographs were obtained prior to the project\u2019s initiation.\n\u00b7\nCT scanners\nMultidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and volume computed tomography (VCT) have made it simple to obtain a volume data set that can be reconstructed as well as viewed with multiplanar reformation tools (MPR). Studies of the cranial and facial region, although viewed in both soft tissue and bone windows, render its use primarily for osseous and dental structures of the cranio-maxillofacial complex.\nIt is crucial for image quality to position the patient in the center of the scan field. Patients lying in supine position, head first into the gantry, should be assessed at rest, maintaining teeth occlusion, and must not swallow nor chew during the imaging acquisition process. The table height should be centered such that the external auditory meatus (EAM) is at the center of the gantry so that the desired cranial defect area lies within the boundaries of a selected field of view (FOV). This is achieved by moving the patient\u2019s head in the FOV or moving the FOV over the patient\u2019s region of interest (ROI). Use the lowest head rest available to get the patient\u2019s head back sufficiently so that the occlusal plane is vertical (\nsee\nTable 1 \u2013\nSuppl. Files\n). It is easier to acquire high quality images for a particular ROI using a larger FOV. To reduce or avoid ocular lens exposure, the scan angle should be parallel to a line created by the supraorbital ridge and the inner table of the posterior margin of the foramen magnum - perform one or both of these maneuvers whenever possible. Finally, a helpful way to determine the orientation of a CT scan image is to use radiopaque markers. Remember: gantry tilt is available for sequence scanning, not for spiral scanning and that gantry tilt is not available for dual source scanners.\n** Table 1 **\nIn the CT scanner, settings are based on image slice thickness, slice spacing, number of pixels, and grey scale. Grey scale, according to Hounsfield dimensionless units (HU), represents tissue density for prompt identification of different tissues in sequential images. Accordingly, bones appear in white, soft tissues in grey, and air cavities in black. For CT of the head, contiguous or overlapping axial slices should be acquired with a slice thickness of no greater than 1 mm (\nsee\nTable 2 \u2013\nSuppl. Files\n). Data sets, presenting maxilla and mandible for standard reference, should cover 10 mm above and below the patient\u2019s region of interest (ROI), determined by the surgeon. Please, consult manufacturer specific protocols and medical physicist to assist in determining mode and features of the CT scanning available at your hospital facility to maximize image quality and acquisition and compare to the parameters suggested in\nTable 1\nand in\nTable 2\n(\nSuppl. Files\n)\n(\nlinks A,B\n).\n** Table 2 **\nIn the current study, cranioplasty CT scanning was performed using helical/spiral scanners: Somatom Definition AS 64 slice, Simens (HR/PE); Brilliance Multislice 16 Channels, Phillips, RJ (HMMC/RJ). Contiguous \u2264 1-mm reconstructed slices were produced from the data volume. The data was then downloaded from the scanner workstations and files were saved in DICOM format (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)\n(\nlink C\n),\nwhich is standard format for management of medical information and related data, including CT images, for subsequent editing. This Protocol does not include Cone Beam CT, a volumetric method for integrating images, although these data can be processed using our methodology.\nTransfer of CT images in a single array (DICOM) for use and processing in an Additive Manufacturing Unit.\nDue to its bigger size relative to the other standard sizes of the image file, the storage and transmission of DICOM files become one of the problems in a hospital information system with limited resources assisting patients who undergo cranioplasty. The volume itself,\njust over 500 slices, becomes over 250 MBytes of data \u2013 and for subsequent image processing tasks one can approximately multiply that by 4, so the computer should have > 1 GB RAM. Modern hard disks should provide read performance exceeding 25 Mbytes/sec, so anything beyond 10 sec is probably not optimal. Of importance, DICOM can hold both raw pixel data and JPEG-compressed pixel data, as well as many other formats. Compression aims to reduce file size, but, with decreasing data quality of the original image. Thus, original image files should be kept at the primary hospital facility until receipt confirmation by the Additive Manufacturing Unit (Lopes da Silva et al., 2017).\nTransfer or sharing of larger medical DICOM image data-sets (\u2248 250 MBytes) ensures that images conform to high quality standards.

The cost of delivering the CD must also be taken into account. Also, CDs and DVDs can be easily lost, misplaced or get damaged.\nCD-RW (Compact Disc-ReWritable) often get scratches that ruin the data and are not recommended to be used.\nii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cloud-based DICOM solutions, such as the GoogleDrive (Google\u00ae), OneDrive (Microsoft \u00ae) and AppleCloud (Apple \u00ae). Most providers have free versions of their services. Enable users to access DICOM images without installing special software on their devices. Cloud-based DICOM viewers are usually \u2018zero footprint\u2019. This means that the device somebody else use to view the images will not be affected by the viewer. This offers several advantages, among them: i) almost any device can work with cloud-based viewers; and, that, ii) most standalone DICOM viewers are compatible with only one particular type of operating system (OS), either Windows or Mac OS. Zero footprint viewers, however, work through the internet browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and, therefore, do not require a specific kind of OS. Summary of advantages: greater accessibility, lower costs, security and safety.\niii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sending DICOM files via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) using WeTransfer.com services\u2013 send up to 2 GBytes in one go for free.

At this point, the image data of the CT scanned area is a series of 2D images that need to be segmented, in order to separate the bone from other tissues, and converted into 3D mesh, to generate volumetric reconstruction (\nFig. 2\n)\n** Figure 2 **\n3D modelling and printing hardware\nImage processing is classified as a high performance computing task. This means that computers used for such applications must meet high requirements in terms of CPU, RAM, and graphical specifications in order to achieve optimal performance. Sufficient power supply and cooling must also be ensured for the server or workstation. We strongly recommend that the chosen hardware meets minimum requirement (\nTable 3 \u2013\nSuppl. Files\n).\n** Table 3 **\nThe image segmentation process can be performed manually, automatically or using both algorithms and filters (Abdullah\net al.\n2019).\u00a0There are several segmentation methods and algorithms for medical images, among them the threshold base, where a threshold value is chosen using the radiodensity of different tissues to select a range of pixels, which highlights and separates specific structures in the image, making for easier identification of bones and other tissues (\nFig. 2A-D)\n.\nThe 3D model used in the computational simulation consists of the PMMA prosthesis and half of a skull. The cranial geometry was obtained from DICOM images of a cranium of a patient with bone defects. The 3D geometry of the cranium exhibiting defects was obtained by rendering images via InVesalius\n\u00ae\n.\nInVesalius\u00ae\u00a0is an in-house free open-source 3D medical imaging reconstruction software that generates a 3D image from a sequence of 2D DICOM images (CT or MRI) (\nFig. 2A-D; Fig. 3A,B\n). It has been developed by the Renato Archer Information Technology Center (CTI-RA) under the leadership of Dr Jorge Silva, Campinas/S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, supporting 24 languages (\nFig. 3B,D\n). The software is compatible with Windows, Linux and macOS. The application of this widely used and reproduceable software has been benefiting research institutions and public hospitals in LMICs to produce accurate STL skull models for teaching, medical training or clinical purposes over the last eleven years (\nFig. 3A,B\n). The 3D models produced by InVesalius\u00ae 3.1v are comparable to those produced by MIMICS 17.0v software (\nAbdullah\net al.\n2019; Lo Giudice\net al\n., 2020;\nlink D\n).\n** Figure 3 **\nUsing Magics\u00ae, the prosthetic geometry was generated in correspondence to the cranial defect. The .stl files of the skull and the prosthesis were processed through\nGeomagic Design X\n\u00ae\n, in which the component mesh was optimized (\nFig. 2E,F\n). Of note, the three-dimensional finite element method (3D-FEM) is limited to at one-time use, to resolve the general geometry stress analysis of the skull and to define the optimized thickness of the cranial prostheses, and the concept applied to all 3D modeling. Afterwards, the skull and prostheses images were exported to CAD Rhinoceros\n\u00ae\nwhere the region of contact between components was adjusted, as well as where the solid model of the combined components was generated. Fig. 4 shows the prosthesis geometry (\nA\n), the skull geometry (\nB\n) and the combined assembly (\nC\n). As seen in\nFig. 4A\n(\nleft side\n) the prosthesis possesses variable thickness. The value in the region of least thickness is approximately 2.75 mm, the central region contains a value of approximately 3.95 mm and the thickest region is approximately 5 mm thick. The average thickness for the model is around 4 mm. Fig.\n4A\n(\nright side\n) shows a circular region previously defined by geometry for applying force in the computational model to be analyzed using the finite element method.\n** Figure 4 **\nAfterwards, each component was saved through the extension.step\n,\nand the model was sent to the commercial software for finite elements, Hypermesh\u00ae for mesh optimization. Each component was built with a 2D mesh using triangular elements. Subsequently, a 3D mesh was generated from solids using first order tetrahedral elements (CTETRA).\nTable 4\n(\nSuppl. Files\n) presents the quantity of nodes and elements, \u2018backbones\u2019 of finite element analysis (FEA)\n[1]\n, from the skull and prostheses.\nFig. 5\npresents the finite element mesh of the model components.\n[1] In\nFEA,\nthe model is divided into small pieces, called\nFinite Elements (FE).\nThose elements connect all characteristic points (called\nNodes\n), that lie on their circumference. This \u2018connection\u2019 is a set of equations termed shaped functions. Adjacent\nElements\nshare common\nNodes\n(the ones on the shared edge). Thus, the shape functions of all the\nElements\nin the model are tied by common\nNodes.\n** Figure 5 **\n** Table 4 **\nMechanical Properties of the materials.\nThe properties of the skull and prosthetic material were assumed to be linearly elastic, homogenous and isotropic for analysis of resistance. The mechanical material properties of the PMMA and cortical bone are listed in\nTable 5 (\nSuppl. Files\n)\n(Ridwan-Pramana\net al\n., 2016, 2017).\n** Table 5 **\nMechanical contact characteristics\nIn mechanical systems, the contact between bodies is a non-linear problem that presents certain solution difficulties. The formulation of a mathematical model that appropriately expresses the stress distribution and the displacement field is one of the main difficulties of mechanical contact between solid bodies.\nIn a finite element analysis, contact conditions are special classes of discontinuous constraints establishing that loadings are transmitted from one part of the model to another. In this Protocol, we used Hypermesh\u00ae software to establish a relationship between the \u2018glued\u2019 contact surfaces of the skull and the prosthesis, with the skull being the \u201cmaster\u201d and the prosthesis being the \u201cslave\u201d. Therefore, it is expected that the customized prostheses and the bone are in perfect contact.\nContour and loading conditions\nThe prostheses resistance was evaluated using three different values of static loading: 50 N, 600 N and 1200 N. The 50 N load was based on the work performed by Ridwan-Pramana and collaborators (2016) and is an approximation of the reaction force induced in the skull (\u2248 5 kg) when resting on a flat surface without any other force acting on it. A 1200 N force was chosen to simulate an extreme impact condition in the prosthesis region. The 600 N load was chosen as an intermediate value between 50 and 1200 N. Each load was applied perpendicularly to a circular region defined in the center of the PMMA prostheses. The contour of half of the skullcap was fixed in order to prevent translation and rotation on an xyz-coordinate axis.\nFig. 6\nshows the application of the force perpendicular to the prostheses and the location of the skull fixation.\n** Figure 6 **\nThickness of the cranial prostheses \u2013 \u2018bench\u2019 (modeling and simulation)\nThe objective of the simulation was to verify whether the thickness of the PMMA cranial prostheses would be sufficient to support loads imposed on it.\nFig. 7\nshows the results obtained for the Von Mises equivalent stress when the applied force in the central region of the PMMA prostheses was 50 N (\nA\n), 600 N (\nB\n), and 1200 N (\nC\n).\nAs seen in\nFig. 7\n, the stress distribution in the three models demonstrated the same behavior. In addition to the central region where the force was applied, it is evident that there was a tendency for stress to concentrate on the inferior edge that corresponds to the location of least prosthetic thickness. The values maximum stress were 4,25 MPa, 22,38 MPa and 44,83 MPa for loads of 50 N, 600 N and 1200 N, respectively. According to these values, the prostheses would not fail due to flow stress, since the PMMA flow stress is 72 MPa (Ridwan-Pramana\net al.,\n2016, 2017).\n** Figure 7 **\nDisplacement analysis is important to verify the stability of the prostheses. Therefore, the total displacement observed in all of the conditions analyzed, remained acceptable and below 1 mm. The highest displacement was 0,83 mm and was observed in the 1200 N load simulation. The distribution of displacement levels in each model can be seen in\nFig. 8\n. The finite element analysis showed that the thickness of the prostheses was sufficient to support loads imposed on the PMMA structure. The resistance was also ensured by the safety factor (SF) attributed to the design of the thickness of the prostheses. To properly design a structure, it is necessary to restrict the stress imposed on a material to a level that is safe and stable. Thus, it is essential that the stress generated in the analyzed structure, labeled as the allowable stress (\u03c3adm), is less than the rupture stress\u00a0of the material (\u03c3rup). Among the reasons for this relationship is the fact that the load for which the structure was designed for may be different from the actual loads applied to it. Another fact is that the projected measurements of the structure may not be exact, due to errors in manufacturing (Shigley\net al\n., 2004).\n** Figure 8 **\nA Safety Factor (SF) for the cranial prostheses was calculated considering the maximum loading applied to the model, which was 1200 N. For this, the maximum stress obtained was 44 MPa (\u03c3adm), considering a uniform prostheses thickness of 4 mm. Since the PMMA rupture stress is 72 MPa (\u03c3rup) (\nTable 5\n), the SF calculated according to the formula below it is 1.6, consistent with the literature (Shigley\net al.,\n2004).\nSF for the prostheses:\nSF = \u03c3rup\u2215 \u03c3adm = 1.60\nTherefore, considering the above-mentioned conditions for SF simulation, the cranial prostheses thickness of 4 mm was adopted in all prostheses produced by our group. It is worth mentioning, again, that this procedure of simulation is limited to a one-time event.\nThe molding of a personalized prostheses, in general, is done manually during surgical procedures (Maricevich\net al\n. 2018, 2019). This can lead to variations in the thickness of the prostheses in addition to specific defects, such as bubbles, which can form during the polymer curing process. The person responsible for the production of the prostheses should also ensure the homogeneity of the mixture (liquid and solid components). Such factors could influence the final resistance of the cranial prostheses.\nAccording to Saura (2014), one of the requirements for materials for craniofacial bone reconstruction is that these materials shall have considerable order of magnitude in terms of mechanical resistance and deformation as the original bone. Thus, one of the reasons for choosing PMMA lies in the fact that the resistance prior to rupture is approximately 72 MPa (\nTable 5 \u2013\nSuppl. Files\n) while that of the cortical bone of the skull is in the range of 65 MPa to 130 MPa (Boruah\net al\n., 2020; Ridwan- Pramana\net al\n., 2016). On the other hand, the use of metal as titanium alloy prostheses with resistance of 900 MPa (Shigley\net al.\n, 2004) can result in force transmission between implant and skull, at increased risk of fracture of bone tissue around the prostheses.\nThickness of the cranial prostheses \u2013 \u2018bedside\u2019 (multiple episodes of TBI)\nWhen evaluating the need to perform a large cranial repairment procedure (> 50 cm\n2\n), the surgeon needs to be aware of the choice of the ideal material for reconstruction, adopting a safety design to prevent fracturing the skull again after multiple rather than a single episode of head trauma \u2013 as\n\u2018a lightning may definitely strike the same place twice\u2019\n(\nFig. 9\n).\n** Figure 9 **\nFrom bench to bedside: proof-of-concept\nLack of complications following prosthetic replacement in a patient with subsequent episodes of TBI, under real life conditions, supported our computational strategy, using the finite element method, simulating the stress of static device placed onto the skull.\u00a0From the obtained results, we confirmed that the 4 mm thickness PMMA prostheses is effective for cranioplasty. Therefore, the 4 mm-thickness is adequate to guarantee the mechanical protection of the skullcap considering the conditions imposed on the product \u2013 and also biomechanical properties similar to the bone tissue (\nsee\nFig. 12\n). Thus, in contrast to a range of materials available, comminuted fracture of the PMMA prostheses, associated with eventual subsequent episodes of head injury, spares the bone framework as predicted, efficiently preventing enlargement of the primary bone defect.\nAutogenous bone grafts remain the gold standard for cranial reconstruction. While several problems remain that limit the wide utilization of such option, including regulatory requirements, high costs, comorbidity as well as method-specific limitations, customized intraoperative PMMA implants manufactured over the rapid prototyping molds proved to be effective and feasible. Thus, although advances in tissue engineering and biomaterials technology are expected alternatives on the long-run, the current cranioplasty Protocol represents a realistic approach that support a safe and cost-effective delivery of care."

Mixing of the components is followed by polymerization of the liquid monomer becoming a solid mass (\u2018dough-like) after 3-5 min: the lower the heat of polymerization, the longer the setting time for the cement to harden; the greater the heat of polymerization, the shorter the setting time. \u201cCement\u2019 is formed by way of polymerization of the MMA initiated by free radicals produced by the reaction of the BPO, present in the powder, with DMPT, present in the liquid. Notably, PMMA is currently available with different viscosities, different peak reaction temperature and different hardening temperature. Therefore, mixing formulations from different brands or mixing PMMA subtypes from the same brand is not recommended.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>** Figure 11 **</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The reaction starts with the addition of the liquid to the powder, and ends when the dough appears homogeneous (time to place it into the molding) (<strong>Fig. 11A,B</strong>). The cement \u2018dough-like\u2019 consistency and time point parameters depend on the mixing speed and time, ranging from 3-5 min to reach the setting point. Mix thoroughly, but for better consistency, the prosthetist should maintain routine pace, from start to finish, to obtain similar end results. At the end of the \u2018mixing phase\u2019, the mixture should be a homogeneous and sticky mass, displaying a consistency similar to \u2018cookie-dough\u2019. The mixing phase is then followed by swelling of the beads, leading to an increase in viscosity. Polymerization proceeds and the cement mixture turns into a sticky dough. The beginning of the \u2018modelling phase\u2019 occurs when the cement mixture is no longer sticky. At this stage, apply Dersani<sup>\u00ae </sup>Oil, an essential thermal stable fatty acid, to the inner faces of the molding (both upper and lower moldings) \u2013 this simple procedure will facilitate detachment of the cranial prostheses from the molding after the heat curing of the PMMA. That is the key time to start spreading the cement mixture homogeneously along the concave surface of the molding (<strong>Fig. 11C</strong>) - <em>spreads</em>&nbsp;\u2018like <em>butter on bread\u2019</em>. Remember: the ideal thickness of the prostheses is 4 mm; thus, do not overload the molding shell with PMMA-dough. Firmly hold the molding shells containing the PMMA-dough with both hands, engaging the two complementary halves of the mold (<strong>Fig. 11E</strong>). Polymerization continues and the viscosity increases inside the molding as exothermic reaction associated with polymerization leads to generation of heat (up to 90\u00b0C). Keep firmly holding the molding shells containing the PMMA-dough. An estimate of the ideal curing time of the compressed PMMA inside the moldings can be obtained, in parallel, by feeling the increase in hardness of small leftover \u2018dough balls\u2019 (\u22481 cm<sup>3</sup>) with gloved fingers every 30 sec until it reaches the desired consistency. Cranial prostheses were fixed with 4 titanium bridge miniplates, each held down with 2 titanium screws.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Post-cranioplasty procedures: </em></strong>A procedure-control CT scan was performed within the first 12 hr after surgery (<strong>Figs. 11G, 12D</strong>).

Schiavini, at HMMC, give us a perspective, timing and guidance for execution of particular techniques in detail. </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>* The patient should be placed supine, with the shoulder at the edge of the surgical table in a neutral position. Ideally, the head should be secured by a three-pin skull fixation device (Mayfield or Sugita model). Mild elevation of the head, above the level of the right atrium, facilitates venous return and proper cerebral hemodynamics (<strong>Fig. 13A-C</strong>). <em>Trichotomy:</em> the traditional razor must not be used (WHO 2016), as it can cause skin microtraumas and abrasions that favor bacterial colonization of the surgical site. An electric clipper which cuts the hair at the base, 2-3 mm from the skin is indicated. It must have disposable or reusable razor blades, which can be properly disinfected for every new patient.</p><p>* Re-operative procedures (<strong>Fig. 9</strong>) should make use of prior incisions for DC, being the new incisions exactly through the surgical scar of the previously made surgery. </p><p>* In essence, dissecting the subcutaneous layer and the temporal muscle (<em>temporalis</em>) entails exposing well-defined borders of large cranial defects (<strong>Fig. 12C,D</strong>).&nbsp;</p><p>* At last, suture discontinuity and/or any lesion in the dura must be repaired seeking a hermetic closure of the edges. In cases of dural detachment, and subsequent bleeding, it is strongly recommended to additionally anchoring it along the bone edges in the craniotomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>* On a parallel track, the PMMA prosthesis is molded intraoperatively and drill bits are used to create simple burr holes. We strongly recommend surgeons to make at least 3 successive pairs of holes in the prostheses, through which sutures may pass in order to simultaneously anchor the dura and the subcutaneous tissue. Typical bit diameter are&nbsp;1\u20132 mm (0.0393 - 0.0787 in).&nbsp;</p><p>* Following surgical access (large incision) and screening for hemostasis, dural tenting sutures and subcutaneous sutures are placed through the 6 drill holes. At least 3 anchors are performed on each plane (i.e., frontal, temporal and parietal-occipital) to run dural tent and subcutaneous suturing. The threads are kept isolated from one another (<strong>Fig. 14A-D</strong>). </p><p>* The prostheses are installed and fixed with titanium mini bone plates (n=3 or 4) and screws (2 per plate) to the surrounding host bone tissue.</p><p>* The next step is performed anchoring the dura (n\u22653 suture anchors) to the cranial vault. A surgical silicone drain is placed subgalealy, then tunneled and delivered through a separate stab incision and attached to a closed drain system to gravity.</p><p>* At last, suture anchors (n\u22653) are performed to fix the subcutaneous tissue to the prostheses, and surgical wound plane closure is executed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>** Figure 13 **</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>** Figure 14 **</strong></p>"

Assuming that an average 3.3 kg PA is laid down on the print bed/set, and that only about 1/3 (\u2248 1 kg) of the mass is sintered by the SLS per cycle to produce a 3-piece customized set, 69.7% of the powder load will not be used during a typical cycle.&nbsp;Thus, recycling of PA represents one of the most dynamics areas in 3D manufacturing of cranial prostheses. Recycling PA is both economically and environmentally beneficial, not only providing opportunities to reduce costs, but also to reduce quantities of waste. In our Protocol, \u2018leftover\u2019 PA was purified from the degraded components and was reintroduced into the 3D process 6-7 additional times by combing it with virgin PA powder. Including other consumables and personnel salaries, the 3-piece customized set costs \u2248U$ 1,800 to manufacture (without scale manufacturing).&nbsp;Although the initial setup costs for 3D printing is relatively high compared to hand-crafted prosthetic modelling, this is a one-time fixed cost. Additionally, additive manufacturing mold-based prostheses have the advantage over intraoperative molding of reduced surgical time, better fit geometry, less distortion, better mechanical behavior, lower blood loss and infection rate, and, finally and equally important, great aesthetic results. Also, polymerization of PMMA bone cement undergoes an exothermic reaction, during which the cement hardens and the temperature increases. In order to prevent tissue necrosis, the ISO 58833 (2002) places a limit of 90\u00b0C on the hardening of bone cements.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>** Figure 10 **</strong></p>"

Indications for the primary craniectomy at HMMC were tumor resection, infection and stroke in contrast to that of closed traumatic brain injury (TBI) in civilian settings at the HR. The cranial repair study at HMMC also included 3 military policemen (38 \u00b1 4 years old) who underwent decompressive craniectomy (DC) following gunshot wounds to the head (<strong><em>links F,G</em></strong>).

An evaluation of the signs and symptoms was performed through a \u2018Trephine Syndrome\u2019 questionnaire, for all patients, at T0 and T6. Common reported complaints in both cohorts (HMMC and HR) were local discomfort, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, depression, insecurity, paresis, dysphasia, dyspraxia, attention deficit, memory deficit, and worsening symptoms in orthostatic position. Seizures, associated to TBI, were frequently reported at the cohort conducted at HR (TBI patients), but rarely observed in the cohort developed at HMMC \u2013 and thus were considered a non-specific implant-related complication. At T6, patients were evaluated regarding aesthetic result of their cranial repair (excellent, very good, good, regular, and bad). Complications within the follow\u2011up period were assessed as: grade #1: no invasive treatment required; grade #2: invasive treatment required, but not intensive care unit admission (ICU); grade #3: invasive treatment required and ICU admission; grade #4: death]. All patients assisted at HR and HMMC reported enhanced self-esteem and built confidence after surgery. Participants also reported increase in cognitive ability, physical capacity and performance after reconstruction of their skull bone. The proposed PMMA cranial repair Protocol, in addition to reestablishing the cranial aesthetic contour, protected the underlying cerebrum by promptly restoring the brain vascular compliance (<strong>Fig. 13A-C</strong>). Improvement in cerebral hemodynamics was further confirmed by fMRI tests on patients up to 12 months after cranioplasty (<strong>Fig. 13D-F</strong>). The Chi\u2011square test for independence was used to test relationships between categorical variables between the cohorts, considered significant for <em>P </em>&lt;0.05.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>** Figure 13 **</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Seromas may develop where any skin break occurs (De La Pe\u00f1a <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Maricevich <em>et al</em>., 2018). The formation of seroma in cranial repair frequently raises questions about the need for implant fenestration, aspiration and/or drainage (Maricevich <em>et al.,</em> 2018). Studies have suggested that seroma production in implant-based to reconstruct the cranium varies with different types of matrices (De La Pe\u00f1a <em>et al.</em>, 2018) and biomaterials, namely metals (\u2018titanium mesh erosion\u2019), ceramics (\u2018associated infections\u2019), synthetic and natural polymers, as well as composite materials. However, lack of standard cranial-based guidance prostheses guidelines, including sterilization, intraoperative cleaning and manipulation of the flap and associated antibiotics regimen, does not explicitly preclude clinical success of any of the above-mentioned biomaterials.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the tacking sutures applied to cranial reconstructions with PMMA prostheses in reducing the incidence of seroma (Maricevich <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Therefore, we adopted this intervention in the current protocol (<strong>Fig. 14A-D</strong>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Accordingly:</p><p>I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;postoperative follow-up for the detection of seroma should continue for at least three months.</p><p>II)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instances of seroma - the patient should be evaluated at least 2x/week until resolution of the seroma with emptying and compressive dressing. Seromas should be addressed only by the scar (less likely site of vascular injury) with aspirated and drained using a 40 \u00d7 12 needle and a 10 ml syringe (Maricevich <em>et al.</em>, 2018).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>** Figure 14 **</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>HOW CAN WE IMPROVE GUIDELINES USE?</strong></p><p>The outlook for using 3D printing manufacturing PMMA cranial prostheses is bright, with rapidly progressing intraoperative adjustments. Continuing efforts to improve intraoperative performance will facilitate translation of the technology and design methods. Following are some organizing strategies that are being developed to manage to handle the PMMA dough.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Handling sticky PMMA dough: a simple guide to plastic molding</strong></p><p>You have carefully prepared and assembled the customized PPMA prostheses. After a tantalizing 5 min wait for the curing process of the PMMA-flap, you are now ready to take it off the molding set. However, as you go to slide the prostheses off, you notice that it is stuck to the mold. What do you do? You will know how stressful of an experience it can be, since you can\u2019t physically pry the prostheses off and leaving bits of it behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Any type of dough, including PMMA, tends to be fairly sticky. This is why we routinely greased the molds with inert oil (e.g., Dersani) to facilitate detachment of the PMMA cranial prostheses from the PA molding. Alternatively, if circumstances permit, other methods, including making a heated plastic vacuum-mold making and silicone (<strong>Fig. 15, Fig. 16</strong>), may be used to form a \u2018coat barrier\u2019 between the PMMA prostheses and the PA mold.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At first glance, this is an ideal solution, leaving less of a mess than oil to deal with during the intraoperative period. Some advocates argue silicone is somewhat of a hybrid between a synthetic rubber and a synthetic plastic polymer, which means it is still a plastic, no matter how it is spun. Regardless of your choice, the important step is to weigh the advantages/ disadvantages of each method to effectively prevent attachment of the PMMA prostheses to the PA mold, reducing the intraoperative time and without causing formation of reactive metabolites.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Compression Molding</strong></p><p>A heated plastic material is placed into a heated mold and then pressed into a specific shape (<strong>Fig. 15A,D</strong>) (<strong><em>link H</em></strong>). The plastic comes either in sheets or in bulk. Once the plastic is compressed into the right shape, the heating process ensures that the plastic retains maximum strength. The final steps in this process involve cooling, trimming, and then removing the plastic part from the mold. The automotive industry frequently uses the compression molding technology to manufacture resistant and durable final products.</p><p><em>Cost-effectiveness:</em> the cost of each individual part is low at high quantities. This methodology provides an alternative choice to the intraoperative use of oil in facilitating detachment of the PMMA cranial prostheses from the PA molding.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>** Figure 15 **</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>MANUAL silicone molding</strong></p><p>The silicone coating provides a cost-effective barrier, preventing PMMA dough attachment to the molds imposed by thermal contraction and expansion. Silicone coating maintains its barrier properties even when submitted to 3 consecutive loads (time of discarding) of autoclaving, at 121\u00b0C under a pressure of 106 kPa and kept for 15 min to sterility-testing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Preparation method for silicone coating per mold: begin mixing the batch of semi-crystalline silicone (we used batches from Redelease\u00ae). Combine equal volumes of parts A and B (totaling 20 ml). Equal amounts of both catalyst and base are combined to produce a silky smooth, low viscosity&nbsp;<em>liquid</em>&nbsp;<em>silicone rubber</em>&nbsp;that reproduces the finest details. A&nbsp;1:1 mix ratio&nbsp;is very convenient for large projects and also enables mold makers to easily pour lightweight molds. Mix thoroughly for about 15 min and apply homogeneously to the model with a brush in order to obtain a layer of about 1 mm. Conventional liquid silicone<em>&nbsp;</em>mold making rubber often has a cure time of 24 hr. Thus, after a 24 hr rest period, repeat application of the silicone mixture to add a second layer, totaling about 2 mm thickness (<strong>Fig. 16</strong>). Let it dry naturally. Then, the silicone-mold is ready to be sterilized. To ensure reliability of this sterilization method, the critical factors are: (i) <strong>proper temperature and time</strong>; and (ii) <strong>the complete replacement of the air with steam</strong> (i.e. no entrapment of air). It is a simple, cheap and very effective method \u2013 provided that the healthcare personnel follow the basic procedures (<strong>in bold</strong>).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>\ufeff<strong>** Figure 16 **</strong></p><p><br></p>"

At T6, patients were evaluated regarding aesthetic result of their cranial repair (excellent, very good, good, regular, and bad). Complications within the follow\u2011up period were assessed as: grade #1: no invasive treatment required; grade #2: invasive treatment required, but not intensive care unit admission (ICU); grade #3: invasive treatment required and ICU admission; grade #4: death]. All patients assisted at HR and HMMC reported enhanced self-esteem and built confidence after surgery. Participants also reported increase in cognitive ability, physical capacity and performance after reconstruction of their skull bone. The proposed PMMA cranial repair Protocol, in addition to reestablishing the cranial aesthetic contour, protected the underlying cerebrum by promptly restoring the brain vascular compliance (<strong>Fig. 13A-C</strong>). Improvement in cerebral hemodynamics was further confirmed by fMRI tests on patients up to 12 months after cranioplasty (<strong>Fig. 13D-F</strong>). The Chi\u2011square test for independence was used to test relationships between categorical variables between the cohorts, considered significant for <em>P </em>&lt;0.05.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>** Figure 13 **</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Seromas may develop where any skin break occurs (De La Pe\u00f1a <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Maricevich <em>et al</em>., 2018). The formation of seroma in cranial repair frequently raises questions about the need for implant fenestration, aspiration and/or drainage (Maricevich <em>et al.,</em> 2018). Studies have suggested that seroma production in implant-based to reconstruct the cranium varies with different types of matrices (De La Pe\u00f1a <em>et al.</em>, 2018) and biomaterials, namely metals (\u2018titanium mesh erosion\u2019), ceramics (\u2018associated infections\u2019), synthetic and natural polymers, as well as composite materials. However, lack of standard cranial-based guidance prostheses guidelines, including sterilization, intraoperative cleaning and manipulation of the flap and associated antibiotics regimen, does not explicitly preclude clinical success of any of the above-mentioned biomaterials.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the tacking sutures applied to cranial reconstructions with PMMA prostheses in reducing the incidence of seroma (Maricevich <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Therefore, we adopted this intervention in the current protocol (<strong>Fig. 14A-D</strong>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Accordingly:</p><p>I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;postoperative follow-up for the detection of seroma should continue for at least three months.</p><p>II)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instances of seroma - the patient should be evaluated at least 2x/week until resolution of the seroma with emptying and compressive dressing. Seromas should be addressed only by the scar (less likely site of vascular injury) with aspirated and drained using a 40 \u00d7 12 needle and a 10 ml syringe (Maricevich <em>et al.</em>, 2018).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>** Figure 14 **</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>HOW CAN WE IMPROVE GUIDELINES USE?</strong></p><p>The outlook for using 3D printing manufacturing PMMA cranial prostheses is bright, with rapidly progressing intraoperative adjustments. Continuing efforts to improve intraoperative performance will facilitate translation of the technology and design methods. Following are some organizing strategies that are being developed to manage to handle the PMMA dough.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Handling sticky PMMA dough: a simple guide to plastic molding</strong></p><p>You have carefully prepared and assembled the customized PPMA prostheses. After a tantalizing 5 min wait for the curing process of the PMMA-flap, you are now ready to take it off the molding set. However, as you go to slide the prostheses off, you notice that it is stuck to the mold. What do you do? You will know how stressful of an experience it can be, since you can\u2019t physically pry the prostheses off and leaving bits of it behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Any type of dough, including PMMA, tends to be fairly sticky. This is why we routinely greased the molds with inert oil (e.g., Dersani) to facilitate detachment of the PMMA cranial prostheses from the PA molding. Alternatively, if circumstances permit, other methods, including making a heated plastic vacuum-mold making and silicone (<strong>Fig. 15, Fig. 16</strong>), may be used to form a \u2018coat barrier\u2019 between the PMMA prostheses and the PA mold.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At first glance, this is an ideal solution, leaving less of a mess than oil to deal with during the intraoperative period. Some advocates argue silicone is somewhat of a hybrid between a synthetic rubber and a synthetic plastic polymer, which means it is still a plastic, no matter how it is spun. Regardless of your choice, the important step is to weigh the advantages/ disadvantages of each method to effectively prevent attachment of the PMMA prostheses to the PA mold, reducing the intraoperative time and without causing formation of reactive metabolites.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Compression Molding</strong></p><p>A heated plastic material is placed into a heated mold and then pressed into a specific shape (<strong>Fig. 15A,D</strong>) (<strong><em>link H</em></strong>). The plastic comes either in sheets or in bulk. Once the plastic is compressed into the right shape, the heating process ensures that the plastic retains maximum strength. The final steps in this process involve cooling, trimming, and then removing the plastic part from the mold. The automotive industry frequently uses the compression molding technology to manufacture resistant and durable final products.</p><p><em>Cost-effectiveness:</em> the cost of each individual part is low at high quantities. This methodology provides an alternative choice to the intraoperative use of oil in facilitating detachment of the PMMA cranial prostheses from the PA molding.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>** Figure 15 **</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>MANUAL silicone molding</strong></p><p>The silicone coating provides a cost-effective barrier, preventing PMMA dough attachment to the molds imposed by thermal contraction and expansion. Silicone coating maintains its barrier properties even when submitted to 3 consecutive loads (time of discarding) of autoclaving, at 121\u00b0C under a pressure of 106 kPa and kept for 15 min to sterility-testing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Preparation method for silicone coating per mold: begin mixing the batch of semi-crystalline silicone (we used batches from Redelease\u00ae). Combine equal volumes of parts A and B (totaling 20 ml). Equal amounts of both catalyst and base are combined to produce a silky smooth, low viscosity&nbsp;<em>liquid</em>&nbsp;<em>silicone rubber</em>&nbsp;that reproduces the finest details. A&nbsp;1:1 mix ratio&nbsp;is very convenient for large projects and also enables mold makers to easily pour lightweight molds. Mix thoroughly for about 15 min and apply homogeneously to the model with a brush in order to obtain a layer of about 1 mm. Conventional liquid silicone<em>&nbsp;</em>mold making rubber often has a cure time of 24 hr. Thus, after a 24 hr rest period, repeat application of the silicone mixture to add a second layer, totaling about 2 mm thickness (<strong>Fig. 16</strong>). Let it dry naturally. Then, the silicone-mold is ready to be sterilized. To ensure reliability of this sterilization method, the critical factors are: (i) <strong>proper temperature and time</strong>; and (ii) <strong>the complete replacement of the air with steam</strong> (i.e. no entrapment of air). It is a simple, cheap and very effective method \u2013 provided that the healthcare personnel follow the basic procedures (<strong>in bold</strong>).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>\ufeff<strong>** Figure 16 **</strong></p><p><br></p>"

(A) A mechanical NI-sensor & transducer set consists of a support bar for detection of local bone tissue or prosthesis deformations adapted with strain sensors. The equipment filters, amplifies, and digitalizes the signal from the sensor (Sensor PICNI2000, monitor bc 2.0; Brain4care), and sends the data to a computer. Detection of these deformations, modeled by finite elements calculations, reveals waveforms: i) the Percussion P1 wave represents cerebral arterial pulsation; while, ii) the tidal P2 wave represents brain \u2018compliance\u2019 (Hawthorne and Piper, 2014). Bone defect features (patient AJLJ): surface area (cm2): 145.50; prosthetic volume (cm3): 51.17. (B) Abnormal noncompliant ICP waveform before cranioplasty (sensor positioned adjacent to the bone defect). Under abnormal conditions (e.g., decompressive craniectomy), brain compliance starts decreasing resulting in reversal of P1:P2 ratio (i.e., P2\u2265P1) which is a sensitive predictor of poor brain compliance. (C) Immediately after cranioplasty, a \u2018normal-like\u2019 ICP waveform is reestablished, indicative of a normal compliant brain. (D,E,F) Improvement of brain perfusion suggested by fMRI exams 3-4 months after surgery. Net flow (D), flow vs time (E) and velocity over time (F), respectively. The PMMA flap biomechanical data and hemodynamic perfusion responses after cranial repair showed good agreement with the biomechanical data suggested by modelling and further supports its implementation on a larger scale. \n\n",

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>We present a detailed step-by-step approach for the low-cost production and surgical implantation of cranial prostheses, aimed at restoring aesthetics, cerebral protection, and facilitating neurological rehabilitation. This protocol uses combined scan computed tomography (CT) cross-sectional images, in DICOM format, along with a 3D printing (additive manufacturing) setup. The in-house developed software InVesalius\u00ae\ufe0f is an open-source tool for medical imaging manipulation. The protocol describes image acquisition (CT scanning) procedures, and image post-processing procedures such as image segmentation, surface/volume rendering, mesh generation of a 3D digital model of the cranial defect and the desired prostheses, and their preparation for use in 3D printers. Furthermore, the protocol describes a detailed powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process, known as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), using Polyamide (PA12) as feedstock to produce a 3-piece customized printed set per patient. Each set consists of a \u201ccranial defect printout\u201d and a \u201ctesting prosthesis\u201d to assemble parts for precision testing, and a cranial \u201cprostheses mold\u201d in 2 parts to allow for the intraoperative modeling of the final implant cast using the medical grade Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in a time span of a few min. The entire 3D processing time, including modelling, design, production, post-processing and qualification, takes approximately 42 h. Modeling the PMMA flap with a critical thickness of 4 mm by means of Finite Element Method (FEM) assures mechanical and impact properties to be slightly weaker than the bone tissue around it, a safety design to prevent fracturing the skull after a possible subsequent episode of head injury. On a parallel track, the Protocol seeks to provide guidance in the context of equipment, manufacturing cost and troubleshooting. Customized 3D PMMA prostheses offers a reduced operating time, good biocompatibility, and great functional and aesthetic outcomes. Additionally, it offers greater than 15-fold cost advantage over the usage of other materials, including metallic parts produced by additive manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>",
