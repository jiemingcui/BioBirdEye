This protocol describes the steps of CleaveSeq that can be used to characterize a library of biosensors under multiple conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of distinct sequences that can be characterized in parallel are limited only by the number of NGS reads dedicated to this \u2013 typically thousands of sequences can be characterized using a single Illumina run.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each different condition, such as a different chemical addition or concentration, requires a separate tube for the reactions that form the steps of CleaveSeq, with them all combined after barcoding into a single Illumina run.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the protocol below is written as a manual set of steps, the bulk of the procedure is amenable to operation on a liquid-handling robot.</p>"

2-20nM\nSequencing Library Mixdown\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mix products above such the number of moles added to the mixture correspond to the relative number of NGS reads that are desired for each condition.\u00a0\u00a0For equal coverage the mixture should include the same number of moles of each component.\u00a0\u00a0A minimum of 50 usable reads per library entry is required and >100 is preferable.\u00a0\u00a0Note that after removal of low-quality reads, single-base errors, references, amplicons, and other undesired sequences, approximately half of the total reads are typically usable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compute the concentration of the mixture based on the contribution of each component.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dilute the mixture with TE8 to the required concentration for the sequencing platform of choice.\u00a0\u00a0For example, for iSeq, dilute to 100pM, for other Illumina platforms dilute to 4nM.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Addition of ~10% PhiX to the library is recommended to reduce issues related to amplicon sequencing on Illumina platforms.\nSequencing\nSequencing should be performed using paired-end reads long enough to read the entirety of the longest library entry including prefixes, suffixes and an overlap of at least 10nt for the two reads.\u00a0\u00a0Typically, 2x75 is adequate for short loop sequences (<40 nt in the two loops combined), or 2x150 for longer libraries. Both indexes should also be read using 8 cycles each.\nData Analysis\nThe sequencing data should be demultiplexed into separate fastq files for each of the dual unique indexes by the sequencing platform such as Illumina basespace. Following this, the following steps should be performed:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paired reads can be assembled using PEAR\n2\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joined fastq files can be preprocessed to form a text file of total reads of each unique sequence in each file. This can be done using shell scripts (such as fastq2counts.sh from\nhttp://github.com/btownshend/NGSDatabase\n) or other tools.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each sequence in the library, there will be reads of that sequence prefixed by one of two sequences.\u00a0\u00a0Reads corresponding to uncleaved RNA will be prefixed the same as they were in the input library:\n. Reads corresponding to cleaved RNA will be prefixed with\n.\u00a0\u00a0For each sequence, find the counts, Nc and Nu, of cleaved and uncleaved reads.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculate cleavage of each sequence as Nc/(Nc+Nu).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compare cleavage of each sequence under each condition tested.\u00a0\u00a0For example, if one condition included no added chemicals and another had a chemical addition, then the ratio of cleavages in those two conditions, which mapped to different fastq files from the demultiplexing, will give the fold change due to addition of the chemical."
