            "content": "The niche hypothesis, designed by R. Schofield in 1978, predicted that quiescence, reactivation, and asymmetrical division of the haematopoietic stem cell \\(HSC) are maintained by specific tissue domains localized in the adult mouse BM<sup>1</sup>. Extended to other tissues and organisms, and proven widely, the niche hypothesis became a physiological reality in the animal kingdom<sup>2-10</sup>. During the past decade rapid progress has been achieved in our understanding of the functional organization of solid tissues which offer an advantage when histologically visualizing tissue units and putative SC niches. Nascent tissue units can be recognized in many organ rudiments during morphogenesis, however, definitive tissue units, to permit experimental studies or therapy, have been isolated from only a few organs, such as taste buds<sup>11</sup>, Lieberk\u00fchn crypts/villi<sup>12,13</sup>, Langerhans islets<sup>14,15</sup> or hair follicles<sup>16,17</sup>.  \r\n\n\nAlthough the BM looks like a solid tissue on histological sections, where the cells associate tightly in a space-filling manner<sup>18</sup>, tissue units cannot be recognized or distinguished within the whole BM. However, previous works aimed at deciphering the BM microenvironment<sup>19-24</sup> have identified osteoblasts<sup>25</sup>, vascular endothelium<sup>26,27</sup>, reticular stroma cells<sup>28</sup>, mesenchymal stem cells<sup>29</sup> and non-myelinated Schwann cells<sup>30</sup> as critical niche forming cells operating via a plethora of effector signaling factors \\(see for Review<sup>22,31,32</sup>). \r\n\n\nThese accumulating complementary and sometimes concurrent data reflect the complexity of the HSC niche\u2019s function and reinforce the emerging consensus accordingly the HSC niche is a dynamic, multicellular construct<sup>32</sup>. Concordant information obtained in solid organs documents that \\(a) tissue units are quantifiable \\(hair and whisker papillae, taste buds, nephrons<sup>33</sup>), \\(b) SC niches are basic, constitutive elements of individualized tissue units<sup>2,3,4,8</sup>, and \\(c) functional niches are multi-cellular constructs which always involve several interacting cell types<sup>6,8</sup>. Based on these universal characteristics of tissue units we have postulated previously that HSCs and several interacting stroma cells constitute, together, the functional core of BM. We have, indeed, identified such native tissue units in the human and mouse BM<sup>34-38</sup> but theirs in situ topography, cellular and molecular composition and their relationship with the HSC niche have not been clearly documented. We have now improved our previously described techniques, adapted pertinent methods and thus elaborated a robust protocol for the reproducible purification and structural-functional analysis of stem cell/stroma units in mammalian blood-forming tissues. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Diverse applications of the protocol_\r\n\n\nThe protocol, optimized for mouse blood-forming organs includes whole body perfusion, recovery of the whole BM parenchyma and surrounding endosteum by micro-dissection, biophysical separation in three principal cell compartments and comparative structural, functional and quantitative analyses. The protocol can be routinely applied for: \\(i) topographical investigation of critical marrow stroma cells and haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells,  \\(ii) purification of putative niche-forming cells such as mesenchymal stem cells \\(MSC), pre-osteoblasts, pre-adipocytes, pericytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells, neuronal elements \\(Schwann cells ) for ex-vivo modeling and tissue engineering<sup>39</sup>, \\(iii) phenotypic, functional and molecular biological analysis of HSC populations isolated from distinct BM compartments, \\(iv) supravital micro-angiography imaging, \\(v) bulk purification and banking of haematons, and \\(vi) 3D in situ or ex-vivo analysis and reconstitution of haematon units<sup>40</sup>. \r\n\n\n  <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://path.to/image.ext\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\\(Fig. 1|<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2400/thumbnail/Figure_1.png?1357726382\">See figure in Figures section.</a> ) <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://path.to/image.ext\">See figure in Figures section.</a>,\r\n\n\n_Versatile adaptations of the protocol_ \r\n\n\nInvestigation of HSC niches in the haematon is a novel approach that brings closer theoretical and applied studies. \\(i) The protocol details how to manipulate and analyze tissue units in the adult mouse femur and the techniques can be adapted easily to map their emergence in liver and BM during mouse ontogenesis<sup>37, SAR-1-3,5,6</sup> or to study the organization of blood-forming tissues in human<sup>34-36, 38</sup> or in other vertebrate classes \\(L. Laguerre & S. Mazan, unpublished results). \\(ii) We have shown that in the human BM the presence of tissue units hallmarked normal blood-forming activity, however they were undetectable in acute and chronic myeloid leukaemias<sup>34, 38</sup>. The results indicated for systemic defects in the marrow microenvironment<sup>38, 41</sup>, and our protocol can be adapted to investigate the cellular and molecular basis of a potential \u201closs of niche-functioning\u201d in these pathologies. \\(iii) In another setting we have shown that large quantities of haematons containing MSCs and marrow progenitors could be recovered from the filters used to purge the pooled BM aspirate prior to transfusion<sup>38</sup>. Remarkably, eminent clinical trials confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of filter-retained haematon material when it was re-administered with the conventionally prepared BM filtrate to leukemia patients<sup>42</sup>. \\(iv) Deciphering the key components of complex biological systems became central to theoretical and applied medicine<sup>43</sup>. The haematon is a physiological reality that may provide a model for tissue engineering studies. For examples, heterotypic aggregation of selected cell populations, reminiscent of haematon units, could be fabricated by dielectrophoresis<sup>40</sup>. However, a better characterization of native haematons and their key cellular and molecular composition are still needed prior to preclinical use of such ex vivo generated blood-forming tissue units<sup>44-46</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Advantages and limitations of the protocol_\r\n\n\nIn mouse studies, current preparative methods use the BM shaft obtained by flushing long bones, followed by triturating in serum-containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer or complete medium and filtration through \u226530 \u00b5m mesh filters to clear the bulk marrow suspension from residual tissue aggregates. In some protocols the low density, mononuclear cell \\(MNC) fraction is prepared, applying hypotonic lyses, or Ficoll or Pancoll density gradient \\(d=1.077-1.086 g.cm<sup>-3</sup>) centrifugation to remove red blood cells \\(RBCs) and mature granulocytes, prior to FACS or clonal cell assays. \r\n\n\nFor immunohistochemistry and LSCM analysis standard semi-thick sections are usually prepared. In other trials GFP-tracked HSCs were followed by real-time video-microscopy in the thin alveolar calvaria in vivo<sup>47</sup> or ex vivo in BM nodules which attached firmly to the epiphyseal spongiosa<sup>48</sup>. In other works the frequency of HSCs \\(marrow repopulating ability, MRA) in compact bone and the bulk marrow suspension was compared following short enzymatic dispersion and removal of persistent aggregates by filtration prior to analysis<sup>49</sup>. These experiments characterized several aspects of niche functioning in BM, but at the same time pointed to important variations too, which make new data on the HSC niche difficult to interpret and quantitatively reproduce. For example the relationship between tissue units and SC niches has not been addressed and neither the quantitative aspects nor the topographic allocation of SC niches in a femur have been clearly resolved. \r\n\n\nWe have found previously that the frequency of long-term-culture initiating cell \\(LTC-ICd35) population, mesenchymal CFU-F cell population and native cobblestone-like islets were respectively 3.8-fold, 7.8-fold and 55-fold higher in the whole, node-like haematon fraction as compared to the bulk BM suspension. This argued against that aggregates are incompletely dispersed tissue artifacts and pointed to the importance of BM handling from the very beginning of preparation.       \r\n\n\nQuantitative variations between different BM isolates may be due to \\(a) the contamination by peripheral blood cells, and clumping of platelets, dead cells and some living cells, \\(b) the variable loss of marrow parenchyma that stands tightly attached to the spongy/trabecular bone, \\(c) the incomplete dispersion of critical cell aggregates, \\(d) the filtration of marrow suspension which removes only larger \\(\u226540 \u00b5m or \u226570 \u00b5m) aggregates, \\(e) the sensitivity of some antigens to proteases, \\(f) the purity of different enzyme preparations, or to \\(g) the length of enzymatic treatment used for BM dispersion, which varies importantly, between ~6 min<sup>49</sup> and 2 h<sup>27,28</sup>.    \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOur protocol tends to eliminate these variations and offers several advantages.  \r\n\n\n\\(i) Whole body perfusion, bisection of femur and recovery of marrow and endosteal bone minimizes contamination by blood cells and periosteal cells. Although these steps are easy to perform they take longer than the usual BM recovery by flushing. These steps are not applicable for human studies, but adaptable widely to animal experiments. \r\n\n\n\\(ii) Collection and fractionation of the whole BM parenchyma in a suspension \\(buffy coat) and a node-like aggregate \\(haematon) compartment and isolation of the endosteum separately results in three fractions \\(Fig. 1| & Fig.2|) allowing the comparative analysis of discreet BM micro-domains. \r\n\n\n\\(iii) The protocol allows the 3D location and number of tissue units exactly determined in distinct skeleton segments or other blood-forming organs.\r\n\n\n\\(iv) Purification of functional tissue units in native form is feasible in only a few cases from adult solid tissues. In contrast, haematon units can be isolated from both embryonic and adult tissues and this can be achieved without enzymatic treatment. \r\n\n\n\\(v) Whole-body, vascular casting with coloured alginate reveals the vascular framework and 3D allocation of tissue units in many solid organs. This can be combined with enzyme histochemistry, immunocytochemistry or in vitro culture techniques \\(Fig. 3|).     \r\n\n\n\\(vi) This protocol is cost effective, easy to perform and to standardize. Because it respects the native tissue architecture the information obtained is directly applicable for modelling normal tissue units or pathologic BM functions.\r\n\n\n\\(vii) Preliminary works in other vertebrates uncovered that haematons may sediment in a pellet \\(fish kidney, bird and mouse BM), may float to the uppermost layer \\(human BM) and some haematons may remain in suspension at isopycnic density. Nevertheless, they can be recovered in all cases using filtration through small porosity 30-40 \u00b5m mesh filters.\r\n\n\n\\(viii) Although haematons are compact aggregates they lack net cellular borders.  They are relatively homogeneous in size and may attach to each other firmly via the vasculature. These characteristics may cause some uncertainty during initial handling and quantitative estimations. Our protocol provides guidelines to overcome these difficulties working with haematons.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Experimental design_\r\n\n\nThis protocol has been developed progressively<sup>34-38</sup> for mouse blood-forming organs to detect and identify specific tissue units, to analyze their cellular and supra-molecular composition as well as functional properties. Fig. 1| shows the protocol conventionally as a step-by-step flow diagram and indicates connections to potential complementary analysis.   \r\n\n\nWhole-body perfusion has been introduced to remove blood cells and prevent artificial aggregation and clotting in BM preparation. In addition, systemic evacuation of blood from the vasculature is a preparatory step to optical micro-angiography.  \r\n\n\nBisection of skeleton units \\(i.e. autopodes, stylopodes, zygopodes and vertebrae) longitudinally, and/or transversally and recovery, is a novel, practical way to isolate predefined micro-domains physically and to compare the constitution of these isolates. \r\n\n\nSeparation of BM into three defined fractions i.e. a bulk single-cell suspension \\(buffy coat), heterotypic haematon aggregates and endosteum containing firmly attached, residual marrow permits critical regulatory elements to be investigated in these compartments.        \r\n\n\nDissociation of BM fractions to single-cell suspensions using optimized enzymatic treatment is mandatory prior to comparative FACS analyses and colony forming assays.\r\n\n\nFunctional analysis of the three BM fractions in native state or following culture using micro-cinematography provides a reproducible tool for searching and better characterizing putative HSC niches.     \r\n\n\nLaser Scanning Confocal Microscopy \\(LSCM) following Zn-7 fixation and stabilization in alginate hydrogel has been introduced for the simultaneous detection of endogenous enzymes, for multi-colour immuno-cytochemistry and LSCM in whole mount preparations.\r\n\n\nTransmission electron microscopy \\(TEM) is a powerful method to identify fine details of intimately associated and interacting cells within the haematon.  \r\n\n\nHigh resolution micro-Computer Tomography \\(\u00b5CT) provides information on the topology and quantitative parameters for better understanding the relationship between the endosteal bone surface and the mass of BM parenchyma at predefined, micro-dissected tissue domains."

            "content": "Stem cell niches are critical, constitutive elements of tissue units in most self-renewing organ, therefore it can be expected that deciphering the entity of haematons will provide theoretical information for better understanding the physiology and pathology of blood forming tissues. Moreover, the use of haematon isolates provides unique tools to investigate HSC niches in blood-forming tissues of other vertebrates and to elaborate new tissue engineering strategies in human.   \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Cell yields, haematon recovery and micro-CT morphometry_\r\n\n\nWhole body perfusion, longitudinal and/or transversal dissection of long bones permits recovery of the whole haematopoietic marrow and surrounding endosteum from mouse foetal or postnatal BM; this ensures minimal cell loss and minimizes contamination by blood cells and the compact bone. Fractionation of the whole marrow in three defined compartments \\(buffy coat suspension, haematons and endosteum-associated cells), followed by dissociation of these isolates to single cell suspension provides a novel and easily reproducible tool for the analysis of HSCs and niche-forming cells in discrete anatomical and histologically defined compartments. Supplementary Table 4| shows examples of cell yields that can be expected in the whole or fractionated BM using 3-6 month old C57/B6 male mice. Comparative analysis indicates significant difference in number of TNCs, haematons and colony-forming stroma cells among discreet BM isolates. Frequency analysis of data may reveal localized, physiological association among rare cells in the marrow microenvironment.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Quantitative and functional analysis of the haematon ex-vivo_\r\n\n\nNative or hydrogel casted haematons demonstrate a surprising biophysical stability. This allows their manipulation counting and long-term follow up in culture. Due to their integrity the haematons are ideal for structural-functional investigations, for example, applying video-microscopy in organotypic culture. The use of cells carrying stable or conditional genetic markers can provide further insight into the origin and physiology of haematons. Haematon cultures are particularly ideal for testing the effects of biological substances \\(cytokines, colony stimulating factors, morphogen substances) and pharmacological agents \\(neurotransmitters, inhibitors of morphogen signaling) on HSC functioning within their natural microenvironment. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_3D topography of tissue-specific haematon units/niches_\r\n\n\nWe show here that haematon isolates can be embedded in a thin sheet of alginate in order to protect them and then to process for LSCM combined with light-microscopic micro-angiography and/or whole mount enzyme-histochemistry. The use of Zn-7<sup>51</sup>, instead of neutral formalin or PFA fixatives, proved to be critical in this analysis because it accelerated polymerization of the alginate cast, conserved enzyme reactivity \\(ALP, TRAP, acetyl-cholinesterase, X-gal) and made retrieval unnecessary for most antigens investigated by LSCM. Further improvements with the application of dual image reconstitution \\(the combination of optical light microscopy and LSCM) thus might permit one to obtain up to eight colour combinations allowing the localization of tissue units, containing putative stem cell niches.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTaken together, this protocol provides a framework for isolating and characterising blood-forming marrow units and to study putative HSC niches in a wide range of vertebrate tissues. Moreover, isolated haematons can be analysed further either as a whole fraction or as single tissue units using conventional cell and/or molecular biological methods.\r\n\n\n\\(Supplementary Table 4|)"

The protocol is optimized for the mouse femur but it can be adapted widely to other blood-forming organs (embryonic liver, spleen). Moreover, the protocol allows further prospective analysis, for example, to study the proteomic or transcriptome of enriched HSC and stroma cell populations (from G & H) or 3D gene expression by in situ hybridization (from I). \r\nSymbols & Abbreviations: red arrows - living state; blue or yellow arrows \u2013 fixed materials;  Zn-7 - zinc fixative; PFA - paraformaldehyde fixative; ELMI \u2013 electron microscopy. \r\n",

Cut the femoral bone longitudinally at two opposite sides and detach the two bone hemi-cylinders carefully to uncover the intact marrow parenchyma (Supplementary Video 1A). Recover the whole marrow parenchyma by gentle pipetting and pool the resulting material in a 4 ml tube (Supplementary Video 1B). Separate the suspension (buffy coat) fraction and haematon particles either on a 50% (vol/vol) FCS gradient, or by three repeated 1g sedimentation and decantation (Supplementary Video 1C). Remove the endosteal layer with a fine scalpel which constitutes the third fraction (Supplementary Video 1D). Recoveries of total nucleated cells (TNC) in the three isolates are shown following enzymatic dissociation.  Scale bars: 200 \u00b5m.\r\n2B| Micro-Computer-Tomography (Micro-CT).  Following euthanasia dissect and clean the skeleton segment, fix in 4% PFA (1 h), dehydrate in 30%-50% and 70% (vol/vol) ethanol for 1 h each and then rehydrate in 20% (vol/vol) glycerine prior to immobilisation in the sample holder with Heliobound-Light Curing Bonding Resin and scanning. This figure represents a part of the 3D map and quantitative parameters of the surface and volume at the predefined range of interest (ROI) are given as anticipated results in Supplementary Table 5\u2502. \r\n2C| Haematon counting. Stir up the whole haematon fraction in 1 ml IMDM and count discreet particles (usually 20 to 150 \u00b5m in diameter) in 50 \u00b5l aliquots under a phase contrast microscopy (slide preparation). From parallel setting count functional haematons in triplicate on 4 d and 35 d of Hem-LTOC. Active haematons adhere to the plastic dish rapidly, when seeded in small amount of medium (800 \u00b5l per 25 sq cm) and maintain long-term haematopoiesis for \u226535 d (Figures 4a| and 4b|). When applied to different BM fractions (BC, haematon, endosteum) the two parameters (native particles vs CAFI at d4 and d35) show high positive correlation (R = 0.92). Note that the buffy coat suspension is depleted of haematons, some secondary islands appear in LTC at d35. \r\n",

Analogous tissue units in haematopoietic systems, however, have remained elusive. We design here a step-by-step protocol for in situ mapping, purification, enumeration and structural-functional analysis of the haematopoietic tissue unit, termed haematon. Longitudinal bisection of mouse femur and careful, limited dispersion of bone marrow \\(BM) parenchyma reveals compact, node-like haematons at discreet capillary loops along the diaphysis and spongy metaphysis. Recovery and fractionation of the whole BM in a bulk cell suspension, haematon units and endosteal layer provides a reproducible tool for quantitative and topographical analysis of putative SC niches in defined tissue compartments. We show examples how to characterize haematons in native state or following long-term culture using laser-scanning confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, clonal bioassays and videomicroscopy.",
