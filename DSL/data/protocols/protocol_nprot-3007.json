            "content": "Bio-imaging has become an indispensable technique for collecting relevant information in cancer research, clinical trials and medical practice.<sup>1</sup> Hitherto, new technologies for bio-imaging \u2014 such as computed tomography \\(CT), positron emission tomography \\(PET), magnetic resonance imaging \\(MRI), sonography, fluorescence imaging \u2014 have been emerging for diagnosis and visualization of the tumor behavior. Although these different technologies have greatly improved the ability of tumor diagnosis and facilitated the surgical planning/resection of tumor, many challenges remain in medicine applications. For instance, the modalities of CT/PET do not provide real-time intraoperative assistance; MRI is time consuming and substantially adds to the length of surgery, anesthesia time, and financial costs<sup>2</sup>; the spatial resolution of sonography only limits to several mm<sup>3</sup>. In view of these considerations, tissue-selective fluorescence imaging is an emerging field which attains widespread biomedical application to reveal highly diverse anatomical, physiological, and molecular features of the structure studied, and thus attracts increasing attention for in vivo imaging of development, disease and drug discovery.\r\n\n\nIn vivo fluorescence imaging of tumors can be used to assess dynamic biological processes \\(i. e. vascular morphology<sup>4</sup>), and is also a potential technology for precise diagnosis of cancer and visualization of the treatment processes<sup>5, 6</sup>. In this perspective, gold nanoclusters are novel promising biocompatible nanoprobes, offering surfaces and cores exhibiting physicochemical properties \\(e.g., optical chirality<sup>7, 8</sup>, fluorescence<sup>9, 10</sup>, near-infrared photoluminescence<sup>9, 11, 12</sup>, and ferromagnetism<sup>13</sup>) that provide a panel of suitable labels for cellular, subcellular and molecular imaging in clinical analysis and diagnostics. As such, these materials will undoubtedly play a critical role in the early diagnosis and sensitive detection of cancer. Recently, significant interests have been rising in the potential biomedical applications of functional nanocomposites, especially, nanocomposites based on carbon nanomaterials \\(i.e., graphene<sup>14</sup>) and gold nanoclusters, as they can integrate the advantages of several nanomaterials and overcome the weaknesses of a single material, reflecting their \"cooperation\" strengths. Functional nanocomposites have shown their great potential in biological imaging and biomedical applications, such as the disease diagnostics and treatments as well as point of care testing. Wang group has established a novel strategy through designing ultra-small gold nanoclusters \\(GNCs) impregnated onto reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites \\(GNC-RGO) as target optical labels for effective cancer cell image.<sup>14</sup> In this protocol, we report an approach that the prepared nanocomposites through impregnating reduced grapheme oxide nanosheets with gold nanoclusters could allow a clear fluorescence imaging of the edges and morphology of the cells by the swift absorption by cancer cells, but more interestingly for oncotherapy it could carry anticancer agents such as doxorubicin \\(DOX) inside the cells while leading to some synergy in inducing karyopyknosis. Therefore, GNC-RGO could become a multimodal probe and drug carrier for targeting, detection, and oncotherapy.\r\n\n\nIn particular, in situ fluorescent bio-imaging can also be used as \u201cthe third eye\u201d to help doctors monitoring the expression and activity of tumor bio-markers in vivo and evaluating how their location changes over time, which could be further utilized to assess the activity of the biological process that influence the behavior of tumors and/or their responsiveness to therapeutic drugs<sup>1</sup>. This may also raise the possibility for the surgical excision of tumors following self-imaging of small tumor ramifications in order to reduce potential risks associated to metastasis. This is, however, balanced by the difficulty of targeting nanoparticles synthesized ex-situ towards one type of cell, and by the fact that such nanoparticles are prone to easily disseminate inside most cells neighboring the targeted ones. In addition, even if when injected intravenously, circulating nanoparticles may be transferred to tumors through pores created in blood capillaries in the vicinity of tumors,<sup>15</sup> it remains that such nanoparticles will be readily recognized by the immune system, removed from circulation, and stored in the liver and kidneys, unless they are first capped with specific molecules to elude the immune system.\r\n\n\nFaced with these difficulties, we reported a gold nanocluster-based approach for specific cellular imaging and in vivo self-bio-marking of tumors, where the gold nanoclusters could be in situ biosynthesized in the specificity of tumor sites or microenvironments<sup>16</sup> taking advantage of the fact that cancer cells have a completely different redox homeostasis from normal cells. They are generally qualified as being in \u201chigh oxidized status\u201d because they spontaneously produce high quantities of oxidants \\(ROS and RNS, viz., reactive oxygen or nitrogen species).<sup>17, 18</sup> However, ROS and RNS are ultimately generated inside such cells by reduction of dioxygen in order to eliminate excesses of electron production due to their high metabolic status. This peculiarity is exploited hereafter by providing cancer cells with an alternate biocompatible Au\\(III) electron acceptor short-circuiting these mechanisms and forcing them to biosynthesize in situ fluorescent gold nanoclusters inside their cytoplasms. This approach is established using chloroauric acid biocompatible salts, which are shown to undergo a more rapid and efficient spontaneous reduction into gold nanoclusters inside cancerous cells than in normal ones, enabling self-bio-imaging of cancer cells and tumors by long-lasting fluorescent markers.\r\n\n\nWe report hereafter a protocol that offers an alternative to the injection of the precursor of fluorescent nanoparticles by letting the tumor cells biosynthesize themselves excellent fluorescent labels leading to their sensitive bio-imaging with remarkable targeting and no toxicity. As a simple, safe and inexpensive bio-imaging strategy, this method excludes side effect of nanoparticles and provides a challenging multimode platform for cancer diagnosis and therapy, which could be also utilized for example by surgeons for excision of tumors \\(i. e., to see their exact mass during surgery)."

            "content": "Self-imaging of cancer cells based on in situ biosynthesized gold nanoclusters\r\n\n\nIn the case of HepG2 cells incubated with chloroauric acid solutions, scanning electron microscopy \\(SEM) \\(\\(Fig. 3A), black or gray areas) showed that cells retained their shape and morphology. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy \\(EDS) observation indicates that after HepG2 cells incubation with chloroautic acid solutions, the calculated atom content of Au reaches 0.66% \\(from a random region of 2 \u03bcm \u00d7 2 \u03bcm, Fig. 3A inset). Simultaneously, the oxygen and nitrogen contents are ca. 23.01% and 20.54%, respectively, which originate from the cell components. It is then evident that a significant quantity of gold nanoclusters could be obtained by in situ biosynthesis inside cytoplasms of HepG2 cells. The absence of cytotoxicity of this protocol in cells was established by MTT assays \\(see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Information \\(SI)). The SEM images also demonstrated the presence of in situ biosynthesized gold nanoclusters \\(white spots indicated by the white arrows in Fig. 3 \\(B)) by HepG2 cells incubated with chloroauric acid solutions. It is noted that initially, large gold nanoclusters with a rather uniform size distribution could essentially be spotted by SEM near the cell membranes \\(Fig. 3 B), but these were ultimately disseminated in the whole cell cytoplasm, as shown by fluorescence microscopy \\(Fig. 4 A for HepG2; see Fig. S3 in SI for K562) and fluorescence tomography images \\(Fig. S2 in SI for HepG2). These observations proved that gold nanoclusters could readily be prepared by in situ biosynthesis by live tumor cells in their inside, offering a promising opportunity for in vivo bio-imaging applications. \r\n\n\nTEM analysis \\(Fig. S4 \\(A) in SI) verified that 90% of the in situ biosynthesis gold nanoclusters ranged between 2\u20133 nm in diameter. HRTEM \\(Fig. S4 \\(A), inset) showed that the gold nanoclusters kept their interplanar Au\u2013Au spacing at ~0.2 nm. To further confirm the formation of gold nanoclusters by in situ biosynthesis inside the cells, XPS was used to investigate the valence of gold atoms in the gold nanoclusters after the reaction. As shown in Fig. S5, there were two peaks located at the binding energies of 84.15 and 87.53 eV, which was consistent with the emission of 4f photoelectrons from Au\\(0),<sup>19</sup> thereby indicating the successful formation of gold nanoclusters.\r\n\n\nThe present biosynthesized gold nanoclusters displayed the same typical UV/Vis absorption spectrum \\(Fig. S4 \\(B)) as observed for chemically prepared fluorescent gold nanoclusters. In addition, the fluorescence of gold nanoclusters biosynthesized in situ could be observed clearly \\(Figs. 2-3 and Figs. S2-S3 in SI), which corresponded with the steady-state fluorescence spectrum of gold nanoclusters in aqueous solution with an emission peak at ca. 580 nm.\r\n\n\nThe bright green fluorescence of gold nanoclusters biosynthesized in situ inside HepG2 and K562 cancer cells appears to be adequate for their use for in vivo bio-imaging of relevant live tumor cells. This is validated in Fig. 4 and Fig. S3 in SI, which also demonstrates that after incubation with 10 \u00b5M chloroauric acid solutions, a biologically safe molecular Au\\(III) precursor, the gold nanoclusters biosynthesized in the cells were well distributed in the cells, so that the resulting edges and morphologies of the cells were neatly delineated. Importantly, the fluorescence intensity increased with incubation time, especially in the nucleoli regions \\(Fig. 4 B). On the basis of the relative cellular fluorescence intensities, comparison between the fluorescence micrographs in Fig. 4 A and Fig. 4 B clearly demonstrates that the concentration of biosynthesized gold nanoclusters inside the cells not only increased with time in the cytoplasm, but also progressively settled inside or around the nucleoli at longer times, suggesting that the gold nanoclusters are biosynthesized in the cell cytoplasm and then migrate towards their nuclei. Raman spectroscopic investigations of HepG2 cells after 48 h-incubation with 10 \u00b5mol/L chloroauric acid solutions \\(see Fig. S6 in SI) evidenced that the biosynthesized gold nanoclusters interacted with biomolecules inside or around the nucleoli,<sup>14, 20-23</sup> giving rise to Raman enhanced effect spectroscopic bands. This confirmed the above fluorescence studies demonstrating that biosynthesized gold nanoclusters progressively settled inside or around the nucleoli \\(Fig. 4 B) involving close interactions with proteins and nucleic acids.<sup>20-22</sup>\r\n\n\nImportantly, this biosynthesis of nanoparticles from chloroauric acid solutions seem specific to the cancerous cell model, since no formation of gold nanoparticles was observed in control experiments involving normal embryo liver cells \\(L02 cells). This is indicated in Fig. 4 C and 4 D, which show that there is no significant fluorescence for L02 cells subjected to the same incubation conditions as used for the HepG2 cells. This is further confirmed by a quantitative comparison of the fluorescence pixels collected along the indicated lines in Fig. 4 C and 4 D for both cell types, as shown in Fig. 4 E. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that, compared with their normal counterparts, many types of cancer cells have increased levels of reactive oxygen species \\(ROS) originating from dioxygen reduction<sup>15, 23, 24</sup>. Thus, when easily reducible Au\\(III) salts are offered to the cells, their reduction may compete with that of dioxygen provided that gold nanoclusters may be formed. However, reduction of Au\\(III) into nanoclusters requires the simultaneous presence of specific ligands prone to favor the aggregation of gold\\(0) nuclei. Yet, it is reported that hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide<sup>25</sup> could act as such ligands, both species being present at higher levels in cancer cells than in normal ones. Hence, there are circumstances of established factors, which support our present finding that cancer cells submitted to HAuCl<sub>4</sub> solution generate spontaneously gold clusters.\r\n\n\nIn vivo self-bio-marking of tumors through biosynthesized gold nanoclusters\r\n\n\nThe above results established the in vitro validity of the present approach, forcing these cancer cells to spontaneously produce and confine self-imaging fluorescent markers when incubated with chloroauric acid solutions. We further investigated the feasibility of in vivo bio-imaging of tumors by fluorescence based on in situ bio-synthesized fluorescent gold nanoclusters. For this purpose, we relied on a xenograft tumor model of hepatocellular carcinoma or chronic myeloid leukemia in nude mice \\(see SI for construction of the xenograft tumor mouse model). As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S7, subcutaneous injection of chloroauric acid solution around xenograft tumors allowed the clear observation of bright fluorescence around the tumor after 4 or 24 hours, while the control mouse was hardly observed by in vivo fluorescence imaging 48 h after a subcutaneous injection of 10 mmol/L HAuCl4 solution in the right side of their abdomen \\(Fig. 5 \\(D)). After 72 hours, the fluorescence was still observable, though the fluorescence area was slightly extended, indicating that the biosynthesized gold nanoclusters may weakly diffuse around the tumor after exceedingly long time durations. In this respect, application of this protocol requires a sufficient \\(24-48 hours) but not too long incubation period after the injection of Au\\(III) salts in order to allow a selective efficient biosynthesis of nanoclusters only by cancer cells or tumors in their inside but refrain contamination of non cancer tissues. No obvious toxic effects were observed over the experimental period, suggesting that chloroauric acid solutions could be administered in situ, and thus leading to long-lasting biosynthesized gold-nanocluster fluorescent labels for the in vivo self-bio-imaging of relevant tumors.\r\n\n\nGNC-RGO nanocomposites for cancer cell imaging\r\n\n\nBoth GNCs and GNC-RGO nanocomposites are well-distributed within the cells, and that the edge and morphology of the cells are delineated well. Moreover, GNCs impregnated onto RGO nanosheets could reinforce anticancer molecular drugs, such as doxorubicin \\(DOX) to realize accumulation in cancer cells. The strong spontaneous fluorescence of DOX could be also used to follow its distribution in the cells cytoplasm after incubation with or without the presence of GNC-RGO. DOX alone did not distribute well in the cells, with about half of the DOX molecules resting on the cell membrane surface or in between cells \\(Fig. 6 a & b). Conversely, when loaded onto GNC-RGO nanocomposites, DOX was well-distributed inside the cancer cells \\(Fig. 6 c & d), establishing that GNC-RGO could act as a multifunction platform for targeting, detection, and oncotherapy."

In this contribution, the protocols of the design of gold nanoclusters \\(GNCs) and their nanocomposites for cancer cell imaging and tumor target bio-marking in small animal models have been demonstrated. The gold nanoclusters impregnated on the reduced graphene oxide nanosheets allow a clear fluorescence imaging of the edges and morphology of the cells. The specific and sensitive self-bio-marking of cancer cells and tumors is also achieved through in situ biosynthesized fluorescent GNCs, which are spontaneously and selectively biosynthesized by cancerous cells or tumor sites / microenvironments when incubated with a biocompatible molecular Au\\(III) species. These procedures take various times ranging from 0.5 h to 3 d.",
