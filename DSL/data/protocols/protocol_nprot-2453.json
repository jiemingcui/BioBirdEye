            "content": "Endocytosis is an important cellular process by which cells internalise macromolecules impermeable to cell membranes.  During the endocytosis, a portion of cell surface membranes invaginates inwardly with extracellular and membrane-embedded substances including signalling molecules, growth factors, and nutrients to form small membrane vesicles which are destined to be transported toward the intracellular compartments like endosomes and lysosomes.  \r\n\n\n The endocytosis is not only important for taking up nutritional macromolecules including a transferrin-iron complex, lipoproteins, immunoglobulins, but plays a central role in downregulation of cell-surface receptors for various signalling molecules as well.  Moreover, in the various systems, signal transductions from the activated receptors to cytosolic mediators occur after ligand-receptor complexes are endocytosed.  Therefore, the endocytosis plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in the signal transduction.  \r\n\n\n The visceral endoderm, a polarised absorbing epithelium overlying embryo proper, actively internalises various molecules including transferrin, immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, and albumins \\[1-3].  This tissue controls multiple signalling cascades that ultimately governs antero-posterior axis formation and epiblast differentiation\\[4, 5].  This process, in principle, is highly dependent upon the endocytic pathways in the embryonic tissues \\[6-8].  The endocytic activity of rodent embryo has been documented by electron-microscopy in the earlier literatures.  The endocytic pathway in the visceral endoderm cells is composed of the apical canaliculi, spherical bodies, and giant organelles referred as to apical vacuoles \\[9, 10].  \r\n\n\n We optimise protocols for observing the endocytosis under fluorescence microscopes, and with appropriate equipment setting, one can follow the endocytic process in live embryos.  Here, we describe step-by-step protocols for different labelling schemes for the endocytic compartments."

Pour 500-1000 \u03bcL of hot Gellan gum/PBST/glycerol solution into a 35 mm glass-bottom dish.  Once solidified, cool in a refrigerator to harden further.  Used and washed glass-bottom dish gives less fluorescence background.  \r\n  8. Under a dissection microscope, make a slit reaching the bottom glass with a dissecting needle.  Embed an embryo into the slit, and adjust its orientation \\(Figure 1).\r\n  9. View under/on microscopes, and record.  Gellan gum gel sustains the embryos and gel itself even if the dishes set inverted, therefore the samples can be viewed on upright microscopes."

The slit should reach the bottom so that the embryo can be located close to the surface of glass.  Embryo is embedded into the slit using the dissecting needle.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "In this protocol we describe methods for observation endocytic activity in the mouse embryos.  The methods are optimised for mouse embryos at E5.5~E7.2 pregastrulation/gastrulation stages.  We optimise three different experimental schemes for tracing the embryonic endocytosis.  In utero labelling scheme, an endocytic tracer is introduced into circulation of a pregnant mother to follow bulk uptake of fluid phase endocytosis.  Rodent embryos are known to internalise maternal immunoglobulins, thus steady-state levels of endocytosis can be visualised by subcellular localization of mouse IgG.  We also describe an in vitro labelling method for the isolated embryos.  The last method allows pulse-labelling and chase experiments thus one can follow the temporal orders of events.  Further, cellular processes involved in the endocytosis can be dissected pharmacologically by applying small- or large molecules with biological activities.",
