            "content": "We report an efficient and facile stepwise Stille polycondensation with an additionally embedded low-temperature step for the preferential step growth of low-Mw fractions to formulate high-quality polymers. We choose a well-known high-performance polymer, poly\\[4,8-bis\\[\\(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo\\[1,2-b:4,5-b\u2032]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-\\[\\(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno\\[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl] \\(PTB7), as a test-bed polymeric material for our study. After extensive screenings of the key aspects of the polymerization in context, we employ stepwise Stille polycondensation upon the optimized synthesis condition, affording ultrahigh-quality PTB7 having high Mw \\(223 kDa) and very narrow \u00d0 \\(1.21). Despite the similar optical, electrochemical, and morphological properties between the stepwise protocol-derived and commercially available PTB7 polymers, the resulting ultrahigh-quality polymer-based solar cells exhibit superior PCEs of up to 9.97% with impressively negligible device-to-device performance variations, constituting a substantial improvement from control devices based on the commercial polymer. The stepwise Stille polycondensation process is readily applicable to a wide variety of other polymer systems requiring ultrahigh quality and can be immediately incorporated into synthetic organic chemists\u2019 repertoire as a principal reaction protocol."

We reacted the mixture in a preheated oil bath at 120 \u00b0C for 1 h for the initial stage, after which allowed the temperature to reduce and kept the tube cooled for 11 h. \r\n  4. Reset the temperature to 120 \u00b0C and continuously maintain this temperature for 1 day. \r\n  5. After cooling to room temperature, purify the precipitates in methanol by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform."

Using a stepwise heating protocol in the Stille polycondensation in conjunction with optimized processing, we obtained an ultrahigh-quality PTB7 polymer having high Mw and very narrow \u00d0. The resulting ultrahigh-quality polymer-based solar cells demonstrate up to 9.97% power conversion efficiencies \\(PCEs), which is over 24% enhancement from the control devices fabricated with commercially available PTB7. Moreover, we observe almost negligible batch-to-batch variations in the overall PCE values from ultrahigh-quality polymer-based devices. The proposed stepwise polymerization demonstrates a facile and effective strategy for synthesizing high-quality semiconducting polymers that can significantly improve device yield in polymer-based solar cells, an important factor for the commercialization of organic solar cells, by mitigating device-to-device variations.",
