            "content": "ER-PM junctions are defined as spatially extended or small circular compartments in which the PM and ER membranes are stably separated at a distance of approximately 10-20 nm without direct membrane fusion \\(1). The broad significance of this structure has only recently begun to be appreciated, with emerging roles in lipid metabolism and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis \\(1-4). Although ER-PM junctions were first observed over half a century ago \\(5), systematic dissection of this specialized subcompartment at the molecular level remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate methods and convenient tools: first, ER-PM junctions can hardly be isolated in vitro by conventional biochemical methods due to their unique spatial organization; second, even though RNAi screening has proven quite effective for discovering unknown regulators for biological pathways or physiological processes \\(6), reliable cellular assays representing functional ER-PM junctions, to our knowledge, are not available in mammalian cells to enable a high-throughput screen. These difficulties motivated us to explore a non-biased yet effective approach to obtain an integrated picture of ER-PM junctions. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBy taking advantage of a recently-developed in situ protein labeling technique \\(7, 8), we set out to map the proteome of ER-PM junctions that are dedicated to store operated calcium entry \\(SOCE), a fundamental physiological process that is mediated by two major protein families, STIM and ORAI\\(3). The ER-resident Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein, STIM1, when fused to an engineered ascorbate peroxidase 2 \\(APEX2), enables proximity biotin labeling with least perturbation to the architecture of ER-PM junctions, thereby opening new avenues for capturing protein complexes situated at or in close proximity of STIM1 in living cells \\(**Fig. 1a**). At the heart of this in situ protein labeling technique is the APEX2-catalyzed conversion of biotin-phenol in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to phenoxyl radicals, which could attack electron-rich amino acids and covalently attach biotin tags to targeted proteins \\(7, 8). Biotinylated proteins can be subsequently enriched by streptavidin beads and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Notably, these radicals have very short lifetimes \\(<1 ms) with an estimated labeling radius of <20 nm \\(7, 9, 10), which matches the maximal distance between the membranes of ER and PM at junctional sites. One additional benefit of this approach is that it enables dynamic sampling of this specialized cellular compartment during the translocation of STIM1 from ER toward PM, thus allowing us to compare protein complexes surrounding STIM1 before and after store depletion."

This process was dependent on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> since biotinylation was not observed while omitting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the reaction medium. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>- and APEX2-dependent biotinylation of protein complexes surrounding STIM1 was further confirmed by silver staining after affinity enrichment and independently by western blotting probed by streptavidin-HRP \\(**Fig. 1d**). Because ORAI1 \\(MW = 33 kDa) is a known binding partner of STIM1, we first analyzed a gel slice corresponding to 25-37 kDa on the SDS-PAGE with mass spectrometry in our pilot experiment and confirmed the presence of ORAI1 using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry \\(LC-MS/MS). In the same gel band, we repeatedly detected the gene product of TMEM110 \\(NCBI RefSeq ID: NM_198563), hereafter designated as STIMATE \\(for STIM-activating enhancer). In our subsequent LC-MS/MS analyses on all the eluted products, we further identified a total of 73 potential STIM1 interactors, with 17 detected in both store-full and store-depleted HEK293 cells. The majority of them fall into the categories of ER/PM-resident proteins, cytoskeletal components, and proteins functioning in intracellular membrane trafficking or posttranslational modifications \\(**Fig. 1b**)."

Store operated calcium entry mediated by dynamic STIM1-ORAI1 coupling constitutes one of the most well-established molecular events occurring at ER-PM junctions, but the protein composition at this particular subcellular compartment remain poorly defined. Using an in situ spatially-restricted biotin-labeling coupled with mass spectrometry, we mapped the proteome of intact ER-PM junctions in living cells without disrupting their architectural integrity. Our approaches lead to the discovery of >70 candidate proteins at ER-PM junctions, with the majority falling into the categories of ER/PM-resident proteins, cytoskeletal components, and proteins functioning in intracellular membrane trafficking or post-translational modifications. Although the current protocol is limited to ER-PM junctions, the methods described herein can be readily extended to study other types of inter-membrane appositions in various types of cells.",
