            "content": "In many eukaryotic cells, ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria is the major source of energy \\[1]. Furthermore, mitochondria play a key role in cell signaling, in particular through the production of reactive oxygen species \\[2]; they also initiate or contribute to several cell death pathways \\[3]. Mitochondrial dysfunctions underlie several human diseases and are implicated in physiological aging \\[4]. For example, mitochondrial malfunction is linked to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson and Alzheimer disease \\[5], type 2 diabetes \\[6] or ischemia/reperfusion injury of the heart \\[7]. \r\n\n\nMitochondria are organized into different compartments; the matrix is surrounded by the inner mitochondrial membrane, which in turn is separated by the intermembrane space from the outer mitochondrial membrane. The outer mitochondrial membrane contains several proteins involved in organellar protein import, such as Tom70 or Tom20 \\[8]. Both proteins are suitable to detect mitochondria by immunostaining. \r\n\n\nActive mitochondria are characterized by a membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is the driving force for ATP production. Thus, the mitochondrial membrane potential serves as one parameter that can monitor organellar performance. Several commercially available compounds concentrate in mitochondria in a membrane potential-dependent fashion.\r\n\n\nWhile some of these dyes can only be used in living cells, others are retained in mitochondria after fixation. This applies to several fixable MitoTracker\u00ae dyes \\[9]. \r\n\n\nFluorescence microscopy has been used extensively to study the morphology, mass and bioenergetics of mitochondria \\[10]. Although some of these microscopy-based methods are quantitative, they are frequently complicated and time-consuming. In this contribution, we present a microscopy-based protocol for assessing the mitochondrial membrane potential with fixable MitoTracker\u00ae dyes \\(Fig. 1). Our method relies on a quantitative fluorescence approach that combines confocal microscopy with computer-based image analysis to determine MitoTracker\u00ae dye uptake in a simple, fast and reliable fashion. Our protocol can be fully automated; it is ideal to detect changes in mitochondrial membrane potential that are relevant to drug discovery and development with high-throughput technology."

Our image analysis relies on identifying the organelle of interest \\(i.e., mitochondria) with a marker that properly demarcates the organelle. In the current protocol, this marker is Tom70; Tom70 is detected by immunolocalization with AlexaFluor\u00ae488-conjugated secondary antibodies. \r\n\n\nFor image analysis, the software  \\(i) corrects for background fluorescence; \\(ii) detects fluorescence associated with Tom70 \\(AlexaFluor\u00ae488); \\(iii) generates segments based on the AlexaFluor\u00ae488 signal that delimit mitochondria; \\(iv) overlays the segments onto the MitoTracker\u00ae image; \\(iv) quantifies pixel intensities for MitoTracker\u00ae fluorescence that is present in these segments. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step-by-step procedure to analyze MitoTracker\u00ae signals associated with mitochondria.**\r\n\n\n1. Open the images with MetaXpress\u00ae software.\r\n  2. Correct for background contribution using the _Statistical Correction_ option.\r\n  3. Open the _Multi Wavelength Cell Scoring Module._\r\n  4. In the module dialog box \\(Fig. 2), enter information necessary to quantify the image. This requires input for the number of wavelengths, the marker that identifies mitochondria \\(in our example Tom70) and parameters that demarcate mitochondrial compartments. These parameters include \\(i) dimensions for the compartment and \\(ii) fluorescence intensity above background for the marker. Assign the image for which the fluorescence intensity will be measured, i.e. the MitoTracker\u00ae image.  \r\n  5. Open the data log to save results in Excel format.\r\n  6. Once the required information has been entered in the module dialog box, run the analysis.\r\n  7. The software will now generate segments that colocalize with mitochondria and overlay these segments on the MitoTracker\u00ae image \\(Fig. 3).\r\n  8. Visually inspect the segments for their proper colocalization with mitochondria and exclude the segments that do not colocalize \\(Fig. 4). See troubleshooting, if segmentation is inaccurate.\r\n  9. Data will be displayed for each compartment \\(Fig. 5) and logged to Excel."

Some of the segments generated by the software do not properly colocalize with mitochondria or compartments are missed. \r\n   The information entered into the dialog box \\(intensity above background and compartment dimensions) can be modified to improve the accuracy of compartment identification. Fig. 2 shows values that can be used as guidelines for SCG neurons, MCF7 or LLC-PK1 cells. Other specimen may require further modifications. \r\n\n\n2. False positives. If the software recognizes false positives, increasing the threshold for intensity above background can ameliorate the problem. \r\n   Alternatively, if the antibody staining results in high background, affinity-purification of primary and/or secondary antibodies may reduce false positives. Compartment identification can be improved by combining two different mitochondrial markers. Together, two markers \\(such as of Tom70 and another mitochondrial protein) will increase the accuracy of compartment identification. This strategy has been successful for other cellular compartments \\[19]."

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to multiple diseases and pathophysiologies, including a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, as key regulators of cell death, mitochondria are also prime targets for cancer research and at the center of drug development. The mitochondrial membrane potential is essential for ATP production and an important parameter to assess the functional state of these organelles. As MitoTracker\u00ae dyes concentrate in active mitochondria, they are ideal tools to evaluate mitochondrial function. We have developed a simple, fast and reliable protocol that measures MitoTracker\u00ae signals associated with mitochondria. Our protocol was successfully applied to assess changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential in diverse cell types from different organisms. The method developed by us provides a powerful tool for mitochondrial research and can be easily adapted for drug screening.",
