serum (FBS) to the remaining volume of MEM.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 5mL of 100X penicillin/streptomycin to the medium.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mix thoroughly and label with the date and additives.\nCollagen Coating of Tissue Culture Plates\n16HBE cells should be grown on dishes/plates/inserts that have been coated with 50 mg/mL bovine collagen I solution according to the separate method \u201cCollagen Coating for Tissue Culture\u201d.\nThawing Cryopreserved Cells\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Warm media and prepare materials prior to obtaining a vial of cells from cryostorage.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This reduces the amount of time cells are thawed in the presence of DMSO.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove vial from liquid nitrogen (wearing eye protection) and thaw in 37\u00b0C water bath (1-2 min).\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is important that cells are thawed quickly to prevent damage and reduced viability.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 24 mL of growth medium to a 50 mL conical tube then add the thawed cells and gently mix by inversion.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pellet cells via centrifugation at 1,000 x\ng\nfor 3 minutes at room temperature.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carefully aspirate the supernatant.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gently resuspend the cells in 10mL of pre-warmed growth medium and transfer into a 10 cm collagen coated tissue culture dish (see separate method \u201cCollagen Coating for Tissue Culture\u201d).\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate in a humidified 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO\n2\novernight.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Check cells the following day for attachment to the dish.\u00a0Replace medium to remove dead cells (rounded, unattached cells).\u00a0Culture at least three passages before using in experiments.\nSub-culturing cells\nCells should be split three days after being plated at 2.5 x 10\n5\ncells/mL\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pre-warm growth medium and PBS in a 37 \u00b0C water bath and a trypsin aliquot at room temperature (~30 minutes).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the cull culture medium.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rinse cells in 10 cm plates with 10 mL pre-warmed PBS (use 20 mL for 15 cm plates), swirling gently.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the PBS wash.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 750 \u03bcL trypsin (for 10 cm plate, 1.5mL of 15 cm plate) and spread evenly across the cell surface\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place in 37 \u00b0C incubator for 4 minutes.\u00a0Following incubation, use the palm of your hand to hit the side of dish to facilitate detachment.\u00a0If cells are still attached, incubate for another 2 minutes.\u00a0Incubate and tap dish until >95% of the cells are detached.\u00a0Check detachment with microscope.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 12 mL medium and gently wash the surface of the dish with a pipette and triturate once to break up any large cell clumps.\u00a0Transfer to a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash the plate with an additional 12 mL of medium, collect, triturate, and add to the cell suspension in step #7.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge at 1,000 x\ng\nfor 4 minutes to pellet cells.\n10.\u00a0Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 12 mL of medium.\u00a0Add additional growth medium to dilute the cell suspension if desired.\u00a0Typically, medium is added such that there is a total volume of 12 mL per 1-2 15 cm plates collected.\n11.\u00a0Prepare a 1:5 dilution in PBS (800 \u03bcL PBS + 200 \u03bcL cell suspension) in an Eppendorf tube.\n12.\u00a0Count cells on a hemocytometer (do not use an automated cell counter as these cells tend to form small clumps that are not accurately quantified by automated methods).\n13.\u00a0Dilute cells to 2.5 x 10\n5\ncells/mL in growth medium in a 50 mL tube or larger sterile bottle to the total volume that will be used for plating (10 mL for each 10 cm plate and 25 mL for each 15 cm plate).\n14.\u00a0Mix thoroughly by swirling and dispense the diluted cell suspension into collagen coated tissue culture dishes (see separate method \u201cCollagen Coating for Tissue Culture\u201d).\n15.\u00a0Incubate in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\n.\u00a0Cells will be ready to split three days after plating.\na.\nNOTE:\nplating cells at a determined cell density will result in more predictable sub-culture and more reproducible performance in subsequent experimental assays.\nPreparing cells for cryopreservation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare freezing medium.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a050% FBS, 40% growth medium, 10% DMSO.\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filter through a 0.2 \u03bcm syringe filter.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Follow sub-culturing protocol through step #7.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determine the number of cells present and pellet cells by centrifugation at 1,000 x\ng\nfor 3 minutes at room temperature.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend the cell pellet at a density of 3.0 x 10\n6\ncells/mL in freezing medium.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aliquot into cryovials (1 mL per vial).\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put vials in a controlled cell freezing container (filled to indicated line with isopropyl alcohol) and place in a -80 \u00b0C freezer overnight.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The chamber regulates cooling to about 1 \u00b0C per minute.\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NOTE: isopropanol should be changed after every three freezing cycles.\nc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NOTE: do not leave vials at -80 \u00b0C longer than overnight as it will impact viability after thawing.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put the frozen vials in liquid nitrogen storage."
