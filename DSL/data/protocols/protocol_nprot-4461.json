            "content": "**INTRODUCTION**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNeurokinin-1 receptor \\(NK1R) is a member of the tachykinin family of G-protein-coupled receptors, which are widely expressed in various cell types in the lungs, including endothelial, epithelial, and smooth muscle cells, as well as in monocytes, neutrophils, fibroblasts, and mast cells<sup>1 2 3 4</sup>. Overexpression of NK1R, which functions as a mediator in physiological processes including proliferation, metastasis and overall survival, is observed in malignant tumors<sup>5</sup>. Given that background levels of NK1R in normal cells are relatively low <sup>6 7</sup> , these results implicate NK1R as a promising biomarker for clinical lung cancer research.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn addition to conventional detection methods such as molecular imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, and blood biochemistry tests, which are constrained to the detection of advanced-stage cancer<sup>8 9 10 11</sup>, molecular probes that bind specifically to NK1R may provide a more powerful tool with regard to early-stage diagnosis and therapy<sup>12</sup>. The neuropeptide substance P \\(SP, sequence: MLGFFQQPKPR) is a known ligand of NK1R with high affinity and selectivity, which can be used as a biotag in a detection probe<sup>13 14</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn terms of efficient detection, both MRI and FI have already been used for developing biomedical probes, thus improving the accuracy of disease diagnosis<sup>15 16</sup>. For example, fluorescent probes have been used to sense biomarkers such as mRNA<sup>17</sup>, proteins<sup>18</sup>, and enzymes<sup>19</sup>. In addition, MRI, as a non-invasive modality based on Gd \\(III)-DOTA complexes, possesses advantages in terms of stability, low cellular radiance, and accessibility into cells, as well as high spatial and temporal resolutions. MRI can thus be used as a central method for quantitative monitoring in biomedical systems<sup>20 21 22</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe recently developed a dual-mode probe for the detection of NK1R using the aggregation of modified substance P in a terpyridine-Fe\\(II) complex with Gd \\(III)-DOTA into well-defined nanostructures. The designed probe **1** is based on the following general principles: i) aggregation of the probe **1** complex containing four to six terpyridine-Fe \\(II) and Gd \\(III)-DOTA reduces the exchange rate of inner-sphere water molecules; ii) the fluorescence of probe **1** itself can effectively be weakened by an aggregation-caused quenching effect; iii) upon selective binding to NK1R, the distance between the initially hindered dyes is enlarged, leading to turning on of the fluorescent signal; and iv) the disaggregation of probe **1** upon binding to NK1R simultaneously causes an increase in the exchange rate of water molecules between the inner- and out-spheres resulting in MRI contrast enhancement \\(**Fig. 1**).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHere, we present a protocol for synthesizing probe **1** including the synthesis of peptide **1** and identification of the probe **1** complex. We emphasize its applications in serum from lung cancer patients. We explain the experimental procedures for NK1R expression and purification, the FI and MRI responses of probe **1** to NK1R _in vitro_, and the application of probe **1** in serum detection in lung cancer patents. These procedures will help to improve the clinical diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**METHODS**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Construction of dual-mode probes.** Peptide **1** was prepared using rink amide resin by an Fmoc-based solid-phase method \\(**Fig. 2**; steps 1-20). The crude product was then purified to 99.0 % and gave a total yield of 8.2 % after cleavage and deprotection. The probe of interest utilized the original SP sequence as the binding head group, with eight lysine residues attached with two terpyridines and a fluorophore \\(hemicyanine dye) <sup>23 24</sup> to construct a binary complex with Fe \\(II) ions for monitoring NK1R levels in cancer cells. Gd \\(III)-DOTA was connected to the N-terminus as a contrast agent to generate MRI signals. The Gd \\(III)-DOTA complex was subsequently attached by the dropwise addition of Gd \\(III) ions, and the product of peptide **1** and the Gd \\(III)-peptide **1** complex were then both confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight \\(MALDI-TOF). The Fe-terpyridine complex was further synthesized through dropwise addition of Fe \\(II) ions, and the resulting terpyridine-Fe \\(II)-Gd \\(III)-DOTA-complex was monitored using UV/visible and fluorescence spectra. After excitation at an appropriate wavelength for fluorescent peptides, new absorption peaks were observed at approximately 330 nm and 530 nm, confirming the formation of the terpyridine-Fe \\(II)-Gd \\(III)-DOTA complex.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**NK1R expression and purification.** Protein expression was induced with isopropyl \u03b2 -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside \\(IPTG) in liquid lysogeny broth \\(LB) medium with ampicillin \\(20 \u03bcg/mL) in Rosetta \\(DE3) cells overnight at 28 \u00b0C and purified using nickel-chelating affinity chromatography. The concentration of the NK1R solution was determined using the Bradford method<sup>25</sup> and an albumin from bovine serum \\(BSA) standard curve. NK1R protein identity was confirmed using NK1R samples dissolved in 50 mM Tris-buffered saline at a final concentration 0.928 mg/mL for analysis. Plasmid pET-21a provided with TACR1 \\(NCBI: NM-015727.27) was transformed into the host Rosetta \\(DE3) cells, and recombinant clones were screened using the solid LB medium with ampicillin \\(20 \u03bcg/mL)<sup>26</sup>. A single recombinant clone of Rosetta-TACR was selected from solid LB medium with ampicillin \\(20 \u03bcg/mL) and added to 4 mL fluid medium for cultivation overnight, with shaking at 200 rpm. A total of 5 mL fresh fluid medium in four tubes was prepared and used at a dilution of 100:1 with the fluid medium previously cultured overnight to allow the recombinant clones to reach logarithmic phase \\(optical density, OD<sub>600</sub> \u2248 0.5) at 37 \u00b0C. IPTG was added to three tubes to a final concentration of 1.0 mM, and clones were cultured at 37 \u00b0C, 28 \u00b0C, and 16 \u00b0C, respectively. The fourth tube at 37 \u00b0C served as a control. All fluid media included ampicillin \\(20 \u03bcg/mL). When the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 1.5, the cells were collected, disrupted ultrasonically, and the supernatants and precipitates were collected. Sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed to determine if the target protein was expressed in the supernatant or precipitate. Recombinant bacteria were inoculated into 4 mL liquid LB medium and activated overnight. The mixture was then transferred into fresh 400 mL liquid LB medium in a conical flask. Bacteria were treated with IPTG at a final concentration of 1.0 mM in the logarithmic phase, and induced overnight. The induced bacteria were collected by centrifugation at speed \\(1000 \u00d7 g) for 5 min at room temperature and disrupted by ultrasound \\(300 W, 5s/5s) for 30 min at ice bath. The supernatant was subjected to nickel ion metal affinity chromatography to purify the target protein.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Flow cytometry \\(FCM) and confocal laser-scanning microscopy \\(CLSM).** We applied probe **1** to determine the localization and expression levels of NK1R _in vitro_ based on a change in fluorescence as the detection signal. Human pulmonary carcinoma \\(A549) and normal human bronchial epithelial \\(HBE) cells uptake were evaluated quantitatively by FCM. Fold increases in mean fluorescence intensity \\(MFI) were calculated using the following equation: fold increase in MFI = \\(MFI of treatment group \u2212 MFI of control) / MFI of control. The change in fluorescence signal thus enabled the detection of overexpressed NK1R in A549 cells, with HBE cells as a negative control. We confirmed the localization of probe **1** in A549 and HBE cells using CLSM to track NK1R through co-localization. Both probe **1** and the nuclear-correlated counterstain 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole \\(DAPI, 10 \u03bcg/mL) were applied in A549 and HBE cells, and comparison of both signals in CLSM overlay images demonstrated that probe **1** accumulated in the cytoplasm and membrane in both A549 and HBE cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Determination of NK1R levels in serum from lung cancer patents using probe 1 MRI signals.** MRI provides a non-invasive method for the quantitative detection of NK1R, with no radiation burden, and with high spatial resolution. Probe **1** provides excellent sensitivity for the detection of NK1R because of its off/on MRI response, enhanced by the terpyridine-Fe \\(II)-Gd \\(III)-DOTA complex, which changes the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the complex by reducing the exchange rate of inner-sphere water molecules upon binding with NK1R. All serum samples \\(30 serum samples from lung cancer patents and 30 serum samples from healthy individuals) were treated with probe **1** \\(20 \u03bcM) before testing T<sub>1</sub> \\(the electronic longitudinal relaxation times). Serum samples treated with probe **1** were vortexed for 5.0 min and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min before addition to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy tubes \\(**Fig. 3**). The internal temperature of the instrument was used as a control. Serum samples from patients and healthy control individuals were collected and measured with and without probe **1**. T<sub>1</sub> values were acquired using a 0.5 T NMI20 analyst using a spin-echo pulse sequence with pulse repetition time D<sub>0</sub> \\(600 ms). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Statistics.** Results are expressed as means \u00b1 SD of n observations. To compare sets of data, we used Student\u2019s t-test. Differences were considered statistically significant when _*P_ < 0.05. All tests were performed using SPSS \\(Statistical Product and Service Solutions)."

            "content": "These results for various steps of the protocol are described below. The formation of probe **1** was characterized by TEM. As shown in **Fig. 4A**, peptide **1** can aggregate into a thread-like network of nanofibers with a diameter of around 3.5 nm and length of several hundred nanometers in TBS solution. In contrast, probe **1** \\(containing the terpyridine-Fe \\[II]) aggregated into a transparent thin film \\(**Fig. 4B**). NK1R multimers were observed to have a diameter of about 3.8 nm \\(**Fig. 4C**). Upon binding to NK1R, probe **1** started to disaggregate into nanofibers with a diameter of about 7.5 nm and length of 200\u2013500 nm \\(**Fig. 4D**).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe binding interaction between ligand and receptor increased the fluorescence, which could be used to detect NK1R overexpression in human pulmonary carcinoma A549 cells. The fluorescence intensity of probe **1** increased by approximately 3-fold at 610 nm upon binding to an equivalent amount of NK1R in TBS \\(**Fig. 5A**). The cellular uptake of probe **1** and overexpression of NK1R in A549 cells were quantitatively evaluated by FCM, with normal HBE cells as a negative control. The significant difference in \ufb02uorescence intensity between A549 and HBE cells after incubation with probe **1** at concentrations of 0.5\u201320 \u00b5M in RPMI-1640 medium is shown in **Fig. 5B**. The increase in MFI values between A549 and HBE cells was about 6.0-fold at 0.5 \u00b5M, but only 2.5-fold at 20.0 \u00b5M, and the fold difference in MFI between A549 and HBE cells increased with increasing probe **1** concentration from 2.0 to 20.0 \u00b5M, demonstrating that probe **1** was taken up by A549 cells because of the overexpression of NK1R<sup>27</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCLSM was used to track NK1R in HBE and A549 cells. The results of colocalization experiments of probe **1** with DAPI \\(nuclear counterstain) are shown in **Fig. 6**. The blue and red signals in cell images were from DAPI \\(**Fig. 6A, 6C, 6D** and **6F**) and probe **1** \\(**Fig. 6B** and **6E**), respectively. The overlay images demonstrated that probe **1** accumulated in both the cytoplasm and membrane in HBE \\(**Fig. 6C**) and A549 \\(**Fig. 6F**) cells. These results con\ufb01rmed that probe **1** speci\ufb01cally targeted NK1R.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe relaxivity of probe **1** was measured in TBS using a 0.5 T magnetic resonance \\(MR) system to validate the T<sub>1</sub>-weighted contrast ability \\(**Fig. 7A**). The r<sub>1</sub> of probe **1** was determined to be 34.9 mM<sup>\u20131</sup>s<sup>\u20131</sup>, which was approximately 3-fold greater than that of peptide **1** \\(r<sub>1</sub> = 11.8 mM<sup>\u20131</sup>s<sup>\u20131</sup>). The relatively high relaxivity was mainly attributed to the formation of four to six efficiently relaxing Gd \\(III) centers within a rigid supramolecular structure \\(high density of relaxivity). We then tested the T<sub>1</sub> relaxation rates of probe **1** at a fixed concentration \\(20 \u00b5M) in a series of NK1R solutions. Increasing amounts of NK1R triggered increased disaggregation of probe **1** with corresponding enhancement in T<sub>1</sub> relaxation rates up to a molar ratio of probe **1**:NK1R of 1:1 \\(**Fig. 7B**). The insert image in **Fig. 7B** shows an obvious change in signal intensity between T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images between molar ratios of 1:10 and 1:1 \\(NK1R:probe **1**).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSerum samples from patients and healthy controls were collected and measured with and without probe **1** \\(**Fig. 8**). The T<sub>1</sub> values for blood serum from both healthy individuals and patients were aound 950 ms. After the addition of probe **1**, T<sub>1</sub> values fell to < 810 ms and even as low as 710 ms in some patient samples, while T<sub>1</sub> values for healthy control serum remained around 850 ms, with no values < 810 ms. These results suggest that T<sub>1</sub> values in control, healthy serum samples treated with probe **1** were significantly higher than those from lung cancer patients because of the signal enhancement generated by binding to the overexpressed NK1R. A cutoff of 810 ms provided an experimental basis for determining if a patient was suffering from lung cancer. This cutoff value may be applicable for the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer through serum assays."

The development of a sensitive probe for detecting NK1R is thus an important goal in early lung cancer diagnosis and for clinical applications. In this study, we developed a detailed procedure for the synthesis of a dual-mode probe based on the characterization of magnetic resonance imaging \\(MRI) and fluorescence imaging \\(FI) signals. This probe allows the detection and localization of overexpressed NK1R using disaggregation-induced signal enhancement. With cut-off values \u2265 810 ms, MRI signals can provide an experimental basis for lung cancer diagnosis. The entire protocol takes about 20 days to complete, while the measurement of T<sub>1</sub> takes less than 8 h.",
