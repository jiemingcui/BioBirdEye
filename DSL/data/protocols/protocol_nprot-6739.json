            "content": "The islet of Langerhans is an important \u201cmini-organ\u201d with 3,000 to 4,000 endocrine cells including about 60 to 70% insulin-producing beta cells, 20 to 30% glucagon-producing alpha cells, <10% somatostatin-producing delta cells, and <5% pancreatic polypeptide-producing PP cells<sup>1</sup>. Although islet cells make up only 1 to 2 percent of cells in the entire pancreas, there are more than 1 million islets in a healthy, adult pancreas that involved in regulating glucose homeostasis. Type 1 Diabetes results from a lack of insulin production due to autoimmune destruction of beta cells in islets. Type 2 diabetes is due to resistance of insulin with a reduced beta-cell mass as well as a defective insulin\u2013secretory machinery contribute to the lack of compensatory beta-cell response and consequently to altered glucose homeostasis in the body<sup>2,3</sup>. Isolated intact islets are often used for in vitro study to investigate beta cell function, survival and regeneration<sup>4-7</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRecently, miRNAs-mediated regulation in islets has become the new focus in order to understand islet development, function, survival, and regeneration in relation to diabetes and to identify therapeutic targets<sup>8-11</sup>. miRNAs are highly emphasized non-coding class of RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in key biological events such as cell proliferation, differentiation, death and malignant transformation. Many miRNAs appear to regulate gene expression in a cell specific and developmental stage specific manner<sup>12</sup>. Dysregulated miRNA expression has been demonstrated widely in the pathogenesis of many diseases including diabetes<sup>13</sup>.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe biosynthesis of insulin by islet \u03b2-cells and glucose metabolism are tightly regulated processes controlled by many transcription factors and other stimuli. miRNAs regulate pancreatic development and cell fate, regulation of insulin synthesis and exocytosis, islet cell mass maintenance, and apoptosis. Pancreas enriched miR-375 and miR-7 upregulate during human pancreas development<sup>14-16</sup>. Genes involved in insulin synthesis are controlled by miR-30d, miR-15a, miR-375, miR-24, miR-148a, and miR-182 <sup>17-20</sup>. Interestingly, miR-375 decreases glucose-induced insulin gene expression and protein synthesis by targeting 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 \\(Pdk1)<sup>20</sup>. This miRNA is involved in maintaining the normal pancreatic \u03b1- and \u03b2-cell mass<sup>21</sup>. Alternatively, miR-30d evidently induces insulin expression in islet \u03b2-cells via inhibiting the negative regulator of the insulin transcription factor \\(MafA) and targeting mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4 \\(MAP4K4)18. In addition, pancreas-specific activation of miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16 and miR-195 favors the generation of new \u03b2-cells from pre-existing \u03b2-cells by inhibiting the translation of the ngn3 transcript<sup>22</sup>. miR-124a and miR-96 regulate insulin exocytosis<sup>23</sup>. Cytokine-mediated induction of miRNA expression \\(miR-21, miR-34a, and miR-146a) in islets or \u03b2-cells have been studied<sup>24,25</sup>. Moreover, miRNAs are reportedly involved in \u03b2-cell apoptosis. miR-21 has been identified as targeting Pdcd4 and inducing islet cell death through the Bax family of apoptotic proteins<sup>26,27</sup>, and miR-146 contributes to the enhancement of free fatty acid induced \u03b2-cell apoptosis<sup>24</sup>. Recently we determined the beta cell-specific miRNA expression in human islets by combining whole mount fluorescent in situ hybridization \\(FISH) of miRNA with immunofluorescence \\(IF) of insulin<sup>28</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDespite the increasing number of miRNAs appearing as important regulators in \u03b2-cell biology and in diabetes, cell-specific expression of most miRNAs in pancreatic islets is not known. Few methodologies exist to address this issue, and miRNA FISH is the most promising. Several attempts have been made to localize miRNAs in pancreatic sections which limits visualization and complete data on intact islets<sup>18,21,29</sup>. In addition, hybridization with pancreatic sections requires handling, managing, and imaging large number of sections, resulting in compromised islet morphology. Whole mount FISH offers advantages over conventional methods based on sectioning since an immediate 3-dimensional view of the samples enables enumeration and monitoring large number of cells for study in their natural structure. Furthermore, cell-specific miRNA expression in islets could be visualized after in vitro culture under different conditions. Most of the available whole mount FISH protocols are developed for embryos and based on bright field colorimetric detection, which in case of islet, does not allow for co-localization/visualization of multiple molecules and limits epitope preservation, compromising the islets for subsequent co-localization of protein with miRNAs. In addition, conventional washing and chemical treatment during the hybridization procedures disrupt the islet cells, inducing shrinkage to a jelly-like disc shape and hindering adequate morphology. Following extensive optimization of conventional and existing methods for FISH of embryos and tissues, we here reported a protocol for combing FISH of miRNAs with IF of protein for specific cells in whole mount human islets with visualization using laser scanning confocal microscopy. The tools used here also prevent accidental loss of islets which usually become buoyant in common buffers used for washing and treatment during FISH. This protocol has been tested with isolated mouse islets and could be readily utilized for other tissues of less than 1000 \u00b5m and early stage embryos as well as oocytes or cumulus-oocyte-complexes without difficulties in handling or mounting. Elucidation of islet cell-specific miRNA expression and dysregulation of miRNAs as well as their target protein using whole mount FISH will enhance our understanding of islet molecular pathophysiology with regards to diabetes development, biomarker discovery, and identification of therapeutic targets."

Total solution volume inside and outside of the insert should not exceed 1 ml. Solution volumes greater than 1.2 ml will cause the islets to float out of the insert. The insert will begin filtering once the media inside is in contact with the outside solution. Each time during transfer of insert, hold some media within the insert until the bottom side of the filter membrane contacts the solution in another well.

Most of the work was performed using the stereomicroscope to prevent loss of islets during transfer and washing procedures. Fixation with 4% PFA was done in the fume hood with appropriate PPE. All materials used were RNAse free. Tools and equipment were wiped with RNaseZap and then rinsed with DEPC water. Collection and disposal of waste was done using the approved disposal protocol. See flow chart for brief methodology \\(Fig. 1). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA. Sources of human islets/isolation of mouse islets and processing\r\n\n\nHuman islets were obtained through the Integrated Islet Distribution Program \\(IIDP, \"text to link\":http://iidp.coh.org) from multiple centers.

Wash the islets in PBS and prepare 50% PBST in hybridization solution in 1.5 ml RNAse free micro-centrifuge tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n17. Transfer the islets with PBS to 0.2 ml RNAse free PCR tubes. Let the tubes stand for 5 minutes to let the islets settle down. Remove as much PBS as possible from the tubes using a micropipette. Add 100 \u00b5l of 50% PBST in hybridization solution. Incubate 10 minutes at RT. Islets should settle.\r\n   \r\n\n\n18. Remove PBST/hybridization buffer without touching the islets pellet and add 100 \u00b5l of hybridization solution. Pre-hybridize at the appropriate hybridization temperature for 1 hour in a thermal cycler with pre-heated lid.\r\n  \r\n\n\nD. Hybridization and stringency washes \u25cf TIMING 13-17 h\r\n\n\n19.  Denature the LNA miRNA probes at 90 \u00b0C for 4 minutes and keep in ice for 5 minutes before diluting with hybridization buffer. Remove pre-hybridization mix and replace with 100-120 \u03bcl of prepared probes in hybridization mix and hybridize for 12 hours to 15 hours in thermal cycler with preheated lid. The unused portion of diluted probe in hybridization buffer can be stored at -20\n\u00b0\nC in aliquot and it is good for a month with single freeze-thaw cycle. Determine hybridization temperature as recommended by Exiqon. For miR-375 and U6 we used 59\n\u00b0\nC and 55\n\u00b0\nC, respectively. For multiple probes having different hybridization temperature could be incubated in a single batch using different wells of the block of thermal cycler with different nearest gradient temperature. \r\n  \r\n\n\n20. Remove 50 \u00b5l/50% of hybridization buffer and add an equal volume of 2XSSCT solution under the stereomicroscope using a micropipette. After 15 minutes of incubation at hybridization temperature in thermal cycler, remove as much 2XSSCT/hybridization mix as possible without touching the islets. Replace with fresh 2XSSCT buffer and repeat incubation for 15 minutes. \r\n  \u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Islets may look sticky and some might be floating. Allow additional time for the islet to settle or gently push the floating islets to the bottom of the tube by flushing the solution using a 10\u00b5l micropipette. Special care should be taken to not lose any islets during pipetting.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n21.

Make a circle of 2 cm with 120 \u03bcl of eukitt quick hardening mounting medium on a microscope coverslip using a 200 \u03bcl micropipette. Let the cover glass stand for a minute for partial hardening. Meanwhile remove extra PBS from the slide carefully. \\(Fig. 1)\r\n  Info: The circle of eukitt will prevent the islets from being flattened by the pressure of the coverslip as well as will make a barrier block to prevent the evaporation of mounting media.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n32. Add a small drop of fluoroshield media in the middle of the circle of eukitt media on the coverslip. Slowly overlay the coverslip on to the slide, positioning the drop of fluoroshield on the islets.\r\n  \r\n\n\n33. Keep the slide in dark at 4\n\u00b0\nC for at least 20 minutes or until imaging will be done.\r\n  \r\n\n\n34.

Therefore, the images from the successful in situ hybridization experiment will be evident with green cytoplasmic staining of miRNAs of interest and two target proteins with red and far red \\(yellow or custom color) signal and nuclear blue as counterstain. If U6 snRNA is used as positive control, it should produce a distinct nuclear green signal. 3-dimentional visualization of multicolor stained islets using maximum intensity projection \\(MIP) \\(or other strategies depending on the microscope) of all optical sections of 1.5-2 \u03bcm apart between z-planes will enable the collection of accurate and highly detailed data on the expression and distribution of miRNAs and proteins in intact islets. Typically, this protocol produces no background. If there is weak background, it will be covering the whole section including the nuclei and the extracellular matrix evenly but unspecific to any cell types similar to negative control \\(scrambled miRNA probes). Endogenous peroxidase activity and stringency washes can be adjusted to remove the noise and background if necessary for other tissue types. Changes in miRNA expression and their target protein expression as well as cell markers in an intact islet can be quantified using image processing software to elucidate the functional role of candidate miRNAs. Although the example images \\(Fig. 2) presented here are focused on the localization of miR-375 together with staining of insulin and glucagon, the protocol can be used directly with little modification of hybridization temperature for different miRNA probes simply by adjusting the dilution/incubation of the antibodies for the other target proteins of interest. In addition, we anticipate this protocol will be suitable for islets of other species as well as other tissues of small size that are difficult to handle, including early stages of embryos such as zygote to blastocyst and oocytes or cumulus-oocyte-complexes."

Whole mount in situ hybridization of miRNAs and co-localization of proteins is a powerful tool for studying cell-specific expression and regulation. Although many miRNAs are potential regulators of islet function and diabetes development, most of their cell specific expression remains unknown. We developed and optimized a protocol that combines fluorescent in situ hybridization \\(FISH) of miRNAs and immunofluorescence \\(IF) of two proteins at the same time in whole mount isolated intact islets for preserving islet morphology, eliminating the technical difficulties associated with handling isolated islets that are not amenable to conventional FISH, as well as for increasing sensitivity and resolution. This method can serve as a valuable tool for studying miRNA-mediated regulation of post-transcriptional gene expression in islet biology, diabetes research, and biomarker development.",
