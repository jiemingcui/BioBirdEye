Current methods involve HSC directed differentiation \\(using cytokines and/or over expression of transcription factors) from induced or native pluripotent cells or conversion from differentiated cell types including fibroblasts and B cell progenitors<sup>2-6</sup>. Directed differentiation of putative hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from pluripotent cell sources \\(PSC) constitute an attractive cell source. While directed differentiation of PSC into putative HSPC recapitulate the different waves \\(primitive followed by definitive) of hematopoiesis in the dish, the resulting <i>in vitro</i> derived population largely lacks robust lymphoid and engraftment potential<sup>3,7,8</sup>. </p>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<p>The inability to generate functional HSCs could be due the lack of appropriate environmental cues to fully support hematopoietic commitment. <i>Riddell et al. </i>converted murine lymphoid cells into engraftable HSCs \\(iHSCs) by expressing eight transcription factors \\(TFs) and using recipient\u2019s in vivo niche to support successful fate alteration<sup>9</sup>. While restoring proper niche signals endowed iHSC with robust lymphoid and engraftment capacity, this experimental strategy is not suitable for mechanistic studies of endothelial to haematopoiesis transition.</p>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<p>Here, we describe a hybrid method combining overexpression of transcription factors <i>in vitro</i> while restoring physiological microenvironmental cues to convert non-haematopoietic ECs to functional HSCs that recapitulates the endothelial to haematopoietic transition \\(EHT). </p>"

Within 8 days, FGRS-transduced Runx1-rtTA ECs \\(FGRS-ECs) turned on endogenous Runx1 expression giving rise to haemogenic-like ECs that have completed induction \\(<b>Fig. 2a,</b>). </p>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<p>2. <b>Specification phase</b> \\(days 8-20): Runx1<sup>+</sup> ECs commit to an haematopoietic fate transitioning from VEcad<sup>+</sup>Runx1<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup> to VEcad<sup>+</sup>Runx1<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> cells to VEcad<sup>-</sup>Runx1<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> cells and erase their vascular signature. This phase is characterized by morphological changes, acquisition of haematopoietic markers, and emergence of committed rEC-HSPCs with colony forming cell \\(CFC) function independent of FGRS expression. rEC-HSPCs are endowed with multi-lineage progenitor properties, yielding CFC-GEMM, CFC-GM, and BFU-E colonies \\(<b>Fig. 2a-d), Phase picture.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>In this method article, we are describing a multi-phasic approach for converting adult murine endothelial cells \\(ECs) to bona fide haematopoietic stem cells \\(HSCs) \\(rEC-HSCs) via transient expression of four transcription factors <i>FosB</i>, <i>Gfi1</i>, <i>Runx1</i>, and <i>Spi1 </i>\\(<i>FGRS</i>) and stimulation with angiocrine factors supplied by the vascular niche. Adult mouse ECs were isolated from <i>Runx1</i>-IRES-GFP; Rosa26-rtTa and maintain in culture with EC growth factor and tgfb inhibition. Induction phase \\(day 0-8) of conversion is initiated by expressing <i>FGRS</i> in mature ECs resulting in endogenous <i>Runx1</i> expression. During specification phase \\(day 8-20), endogenous <i>Runx1<sup>+</sup></i> <i>FGRS</i>-transduced ECs commit to a haematopoietic fate and no longer require <i>FGRS</i> expression. The vascular-niche drives robust self-renewal and expansion of rEC-HSCs \\(day 20-28). Upon conversion, rEC-HSCs are endowed with a transcriptomic signature and long-term self-renewal capacity similar to adult HSCs, and are competent for clonal engraftment and multi-lineage reconstituting potential, including antigen-dependent adaptive immune function. Our work provides a tractable strategy to interrogate the generation of engraftable hematopoietic cell, and advances the mechanistic understanding of hematopoietic development and HSC self-renewal.</p>",
