            "content": "<p>\tLateral Epicondylitis (LE), also known as Lateral Elbow Tendinopathy (LET) or Tennis Elbow, is one of the most frequent arm lesions <sup>1</sup>. Morris in 1882 was the first to name this condition as Lawn Tennis Arm<sup>2</sup>. The term tendinopathy is used to describe tendon disorders of chronic overuse that form a group of pathologies, a disease continuum. This condition is commonly seen in middle-aged adults with a highest incidence of 40 to 60 years, affecting lateral part of the forearm of the extensor tendons<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>\tTypically, its work or sport related condition triggered by prolonged sudden, uniform, repeated eccentric contractions and wrist gripping behaviours. Prevalence rate of 1-3 percent is seen in the general population where dominant arm is generally affected<sup>1</sup>. The word \"tennis elbow\" is inappropriate since only 5 to 10 percent of cases are tennis players, but racket sports activity raises the risk of developing and can develop this condition for 40 to 50 percent of players<sup>4</sup>. </p><p>\tPrevalence rates are seen equal in both the genders. It is seen that around 75 % of the population are affected in their dominant arms. Extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle with episodic participation of extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi ulnaris muscles are most frequently drawn in clinically as well as surgically<sup>2</sup>. </p><p>\tIt happens most often in men and women<sup>5</sup> with repeated upper extremity movements like computer usage, dominant forearm pronation and supination, heavy lifting&nbsp;and repetitive vibration. Consistently it is seen because upper limb counts on peripheral muscles, ligaments and capsules to codirect the movements<sup>6</sup>. This chronic condition is often widely seen in sports such as badminton, swimming, squash, baseball, and throwing activities, despite the name.</p><p>\tWhile the clinical signs of LE are evident and easy to diagnose, no optimal cure has yet emerged. Evidence reports, the use of corticosteroid injections is actively anticipated for the worse outcomes in the moderate and long lasting with controls<sup>7</sup>. As the therapy of choice for LE, many practitioners support a conservative approach. Physiotherapy is a conservative procedure generally prescribed for patients with LE. Most popular physical therapy rehabilitation is the exercise programme for LE. Basically, exercise program involves: exercises performed in clinical setting and home exercise programs<sup>1</sup>. They include stretching and strengthening, manual therapy, taping, electrotherapy, shock wave therapy, myofascial release, therapeutic ultrasound, mobilisation and many more<sup>7,8</sup>. </p><p>\tAmong those employed in high-risk industries involving loading, frequent gripping and/or wrist extension operations, also racquet sports players, there is a greater prevalence<sup>3</sup>. In terms of individual risk factors, age, profession, hobbies, or prior injury, the combination of excessive loading triggers the transition from normal tendons to degenerative tendinosis<sup>3</sup>. </p><p>\tVarious therapies for treating and preventing shoulder and elbow injuries have also been suggested in recent years which includes use of braces, isolated eccentric exercises and standard motions (wrist extensors stretching, strengthening exercise and orthoses), ultrasound, heat and cold therapy<sup>6</sup>. </p><p>\tAlso, effect of resistance training is being determined on raising shoulder and elbow muscle strength whereas eccentric exercises have already shown an improvement in the symptoms of tennis elbow to some extent. Recent studies have found that people with tennis elbow injuries have a high impact effect on the strength of the muscle, pain, ROM as well as health quality with vibrating tools (PowerBall device) more than dumbbell exercise. In the chronic phase \u201cPowerBall device\u201d exercise is considered to be an effective resistance training, putting extrinsic and intrinsic pressure on wrist, elbow and shoulder muscles<sup>6</sup>.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&nbsp;Research findings has shown the use of \u201cPowerBall device\u201d has led to an increased power. Even though use of a dynamic PowerBall has been shown to improve strength, function, ROM, tennis elbow pain and quality of life, most common problems among overhead athletes, have yet to be confirmed<sup>6</sup>. </p><p>Mulligan Mobilisation with movement (MMWM) is the type of manual therapy which includes sustained lateral glide with concurrent physiological movement to elbow joint. As compared to conventional mobilisation techniques in which mobilisation is applied in a static position, MMWM focuses on mobilizing the joint throughout physiological movements. Studies have suggested that MMWM is efficacious in relieving pain and functional ability of elbow joints in LE<sup>8</sup>.</p><p><br></p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p><strong>Background: </strong>Lateral epicondylitis (LE), most commonly referred to as Lateral Elbow Tendinopathy (LET) or Tennis Elbow is one of the commonest repetitive stress syndromes seen in elbow joint. Tendinopathy, an injury to forearm extensor muscles. These muscles arise from the distal end of humerus from lateral epicondylar region. In many cases, involvement of extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle\u2019s insertion is seen. This study focuses on the treatment of a person with LE which occurs in repeated upper extremity movements. There is no such research relevant to PowerBall device exercises on Lateral epicondylitis patients' pain and function. \u201cPowerBall device\u201d exercise is considered to be an effective resistance training, putting extrinsic and intrinsic pressure on wrist, elbow and shoulder muscles and has been shown to improve strength, function, ROM, tennis elbow pain and quality of life. Whereas MMWM has been proven to reduce the pain in patients with LE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Methods/Design: </strong>The participants (n=50) with lateral epicondylitis<strong> </strong>will be included in a single-blinded, randomised control trial. Participants will be categorised into either a control group or an intervention group after performing baseline assessments and randomization. The participants in the control group will be given Mulligan Mobilisation with Movement, and those in the intervention group will be given \u201cPowerBall device\u201d exercise and conventional physiotherapy. Basic exercises and ultrasound will be given to both groups with the given protocol. We will evaluate pain, function, grip strength and Range of motion, pre and post intervention period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Discussion: </strong>Efficacy of the intervention is evaluated by analysing the pain and function in patients with lateral epicondylitis using PRTEE scale, and grip strength using Hand-held Dynamometer. The results from the study will significantly provide affirmation on the application of \u201cPowerBall device\u201d exercise and Mulligan Mobilisation with Movement on the patients with lateral epicondylitis.</p><p><br></p><p>The clinical trial registry-India(CTRI) registration number for this trial is CTRI/2021/05/033363.</p>",
