            "content": "CoPIT \\(for Co-interacting Protein Identification Technology) is an experimental and computational framework that allows the comprehensive characterization of endogenous membrane as well as non-membrane protein interactomes using co-immunoprecipitations and mass spectrometry.  The protocol contains detailed experimental methods for successful membrane protein Co-IP, preparation of the sample for mass spectrometry as well as a description of the statistical methods used for identification of specific interactions and identification of differentially regulated interactions between samples.\r\n\n\nCoPIT consists of three individual workflows that are executed sequentially as shown in Figure 1.  First, an optimized experimental protocol provides enhanced sensitivity and efficiency for membrane protein interactome determination. To obtain meaningful results, it is absolutely critical to include proper controls in the experimental design \\(Figure 2).  Depending on the experimental setting, appropriate controls are \\(ideally isogenic) cell lines that do not express the bait protein to identify the background caused by the antibody and  \u201cmock-IPs\u201d, which are performed in the absence of specific antibodies against the bait, but in the presence of the beads that are used to couple the antibodies and which identify background caused by non-specific binding of proteins to beads. These controls must not be skipped as subsequent identification of the interactome relies on the results obtained in the control experiments. In the second part \\(step 5), CoPIT then determines the specificity of protein interactions in comparison to control experiments for unbiased discrimination of highly confident from less confident interactors.  Additionally, interactome changes between different experimental settings can be determined. In the third part,  the resulting interactomes are visualized with the Radial Topology Viewer \\(step 6), whereby the arithmetic distance of interactors to the bait protein in the center reflects a dynamic variable of the user\u2019s choice, and can be used to assess for example confidence of interaction or change in strength of interaction."

            "content": "**Step** **1** **Co-immunoprecipitation**\r\n\n\n**Timing**:  **1.5 days**\r\n\n\nAll steps should be performed as quickly as possible, on ice and with pre-chilled buffers.  It is very important not to use previously frozen or otherwise manipulated samples, as this will result in loss of interactors.  It is also strongly advised to test the specificity and suitability of antibodies for immunoprecipitation with Western blotting first, and verify the specificity of the antibody for the bait by including appropriate controls such as identical tissues or cells not expressing the bait \\(for example using a gene knockout model).  While mass spectrometry is exquisitely sensitive, it cannot correct for insufficient antibody specificity or affinity or for suboptimal performance of the immunoprecipitation.  Thus the bait should be highly enriched as compared to input and the antibody should be highly specific for best results.  In this regard, it is recommended to use only Sepharose beads that are sufficiently saturated with antibody and show better than 90% covalent coupling efficiency of antibodies to the beads. Saturation of ProteinA/G-Sepharose beads and covalent coupling efficiency can be easily checked by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining. Additionally, the optimal starting amount may need to be empirically determined for different bait proteins.  A very general recommendation is 1x 10\n8\ncells for bait proteins that are equal to or less than 100 molecules/cell. \r\n\n\n    \r\n\n\n1.1. Rinse cells with at least 10 volumes \\(v/v) of 1 x DPBS.  Remove excess 1 x DPBS by decanting or by vacuum suction and tapping on a paper towel.\r\n\n\n1.2. Immediately add 1.5 ml of ice-cold TNI lysis buffer per 15 cm cell culture dish \\(TNI: 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 50 mM Tris \\[pH 7.5], 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1x Complete ULTRA EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor cocktail, 1x PhosStop).\r\n\n\n1.3. Incubate for 20 min on ice on an orbital shaker.\r\n\n\n1.4. Scrape off cell lysate with a large cell scraper and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\r\n\n\n1.5. Sonicate the cell lysate for 3 min in a water bath sonicator operating at 55 kHz.  Critical:  Do not use a probe sonicator, this will result in loss of interactions.\r\n\n\n1.6. Centrifuge for 30 min. \\(18,000 x g, 4 \u02daC).  \r\n\n\n1.7. Preclear the cell lysate with an appropriate amount of Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads \\(100 \u00b5l of 50% slurry in lysis buffer) for 2 h at 4 \u02daC with head-over-head rotation.  The volume of preclear beads is the same as the volume of antibody coupled beads.  For volumes larger than 1.4 ml, pool the cell lysates and transfer into a 15 ml tube.\r\n\n\n1.8. Centrifuge for 3 min, 500 x g, 4\u02daC.\r\n\n\n1.9.

Carefully remove all of the supernatant with an insulin syringe.  Optional:  Freeze beads for >1 h at \u201380 \u02daC to increase yield. \r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT: beads can be stored at -80\u02daC for up to two weeks.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step** **2**  **Elution** **of** **protein** **complexes** **and** **sample** **clean** **up**  \r\n\n\n           **Timing**: **60** **min**\r\n\n\n2.1.

Prior experience in mass spectrometry as well as in data analysis software is very strongly recommended.\r\n\n\nConvert raw data with an appropriate converter \\(e.g. RawExtract) into a file format that is compatible with the database search engine \\(e.g. Sequest or ProLuCID).\r\n\n\n Search MS/MS spectra against the appropriate protein database with a search engine such as ProLuCID to determine cross-correlation scores of acquired to in silico calculated spectra.\r\n\n\n Filter search engine results to a low false discovery rate \\(FDR), for example using DTASelect2.  Search engine results from MS/MS spectra should be combined for all biological replicates before assigning peptides to proteins and filtering the results.  We also strongly recommend to conservatively filter the search results and adjust the false positive rate to a peptide false positive rate of less than 0.5% and a protein false positive rate of less than 1.0%.\r\n\n\n Resolve protein identification ambiguities for example by using a gene centric approach.  Redundant identifications can skew the statistical analysis towards genes identified with many protein isoforms.\r\n\n\nCritical:  The bait must be among the top 10 proteins with the highest number of spectral counts. Recommended minimum spectral counts for the bait protein is between 50 and 100 spectral counts per experimental replicate \\(SpC).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n To distinguish specific protein interactors from non-specifically binding   proteins, run CoPITgenerator according to the instructions \\(www.proteomicswiki.com) .  CoPIT generator reports a rank-ordered list of interactors with the bait protein that can be further analyzed.  A confidence score \\(_P_-value) is reported for every potential interactor that reflects its likelihood of interaction. A user defined _P_-value cutoff can be set to differentiate weak from strong interactors.\r\n\n\n To compare interactomes, the _P_-value cutoff can be adjusted according to the ratio of bait in the different experimental conditions:\nTo identify differentially binding proteins in two different experimental conditions, calculate ratios _r_\np\nfor individual proteins \\(_p_) from the sum of all intensities per protein _I_\np\nand experiment condition _e_\n1\nand _e_\n2\nand normalize to the sum of all bait intensities \\(SpC) according to:\nCalculate errors according to random error of measurement:\nin order to find significantly different proteins for example with a cutoff of at least 2-fold difference plus one or two standard deviations.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step** **6**  **Network** **representation** **and** **data** **presentation** \r\n\n\n            **Timing**: **2** **days** \r\n\n\n The core interactome can be loaded into the Radial Topology Viewer \\(www.proteomicswiki.com) for visualization.  The Radial Topology Viewer displays the bait at the center of the interactome network and arranges the interactors radially according to a user-defined distance.  Interactors can be further grouped in multiple spokes based on a user-defined classification scheme, for example according to GO-terms.\r\n\n\n Interactions between the identified interactors can be obtained with the GeneMANIA 2.2 Plugin in Cytoscape 2.8.2\n5,6\n. Export connectivity information to a .txt or .csv file to load into Radial Topology Viewer.  A step-by-step instruction how to obtain networks from GeneMania and Cytoscape is available in Morris et al., 2014\n7\n."

            "content": "CoPIT identifies and quantifies the interaction between a bait and interacting proteins using a label-free MudPIT approach.  The protocol is performed in three separate steps comprising 1) performing the experimental Co-IP and mass spectrometry, 2) analyzing the mass spectrometric data and carrying out statistical analyses to identify high confidence interactors and differential interactions if more than one experimental condition was analyzed, and 3) constructing interactome networks.  Typically, performing a CoPIT experiment results in an increase in sensitivity by 30-100 fold \\(see Extended Data Figure 2, Pankow, Bamberger et al., 2015 <sup>8</sup>) and should result in several hundred to thousands of Spectral Counts for the bait per experiment. The actual result is depending on a number of factors and will vary with affinity, specificity and suitability of the antibody used for Co-IP, the abundance of the bait protein in the experimental system, the amount of starting material available as well as the type of mass spectrometer used.\r\n\n\nFor example, a Co-IP performed for \u2206F508 CFTR as bait, \\(abundance: 100-200 molecules per cell) with a starting amount of 5 mg of protein from a whole cell lysate and using an LTQ Orbitrap Elite or LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro can result in over 3500-4500 spectral counts for \u2206F508 CFTR after stringent filtering to 0.2 % peptide FDR.  High sequence coverage of the bait \\(often greater than >60% per experiment) reflects the increased sensitivity of CoPIT.  In a successful experiment the bait will also usually be included in the list of top ten proteins in terms of spectral counts and will be highly enriched over input in a western blot experiment \\(see Pankow, Bamberger et al., 2015 <sup>8</sup>).\r\n\n\nHigh enrichment of the bait and broad coverage of the interactome in the Co-IPs is crucial for sufficient discriminative power of the subsequent data analysis. In a successful experiment, the bait and strong interactors will be in the outmost tail of the right descending flank of the normal distribution calculated for potential baits in CoPITgenerator. The maxima of the two normal distributions can be well discerned with one being close to zero.  In addition to a good confidence score \\(P-value, typically P \u2265 0.9), we normally require that proteins were detected in at least two independent biological replicates of the same experimental condition to be considered high-confidence interactors.  However, proteins with lower P-values may represent weaker or transient interactors, and may still be true interactors.  Which P-value threshold is set depends on the experiment and can be dynamically adjusted according to the ratio of bait protein between two experimental conditions.  The approach can be tested by comparing scores for putative background proteins such as antibody sequences and human hair keratins, which should have P-values well below P \u2264 0.5 \\(if the bait is not a keratin or other protein known to interact with it, of course).\r\n\n\nFinally, the complexity of a specific protein interactome will depend on the specific bait protein. As CoPIT not only identifies direct interactors, but also enables the detection of indirect second and third degree interactors, a large but specific interactome may be rationalized by an estimation of the degrees of interaction."

Signal-to-noise discrimination is carried out by including different negative controls, such as experiments from CFTR null cells, and significantly regulated interactions are identified using a counting statistics. Network comparison: Protein IDs and results are stored in a relational database, which contains also further ontological information. The Radial Topology Viewer visualizes ranking, functional annotation and connectivity of interactors in the resulting networks as well as differences between conditions.",

While co-immunoprecipitation of proteins followed by mass spectrometric identification \\(AP-MS) has become a standard approach to identify interaction partners, characterization of membrane protein interactomes is still challenging because of the typically low abundance and high hydrophobicity of membrane proteins.  Here, we describe CoPIT \\(for Co-interacting Protein Identification Technology), an approach to comprehensively identify and characterize the interactome of membrane proteins.  The CoPIT protocol includes experimental and computational methods to establish membrane protein interactome networks and to monitor interactome changes upon perturbation.  While the approach in particular improves membrane protein interactome analysis as demonstrated by using a low abundant membrane protein \\(Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator \\(CFTR)) as a model, it is applicable to all types of proteins. The time required to complete the protocol varies from 3 days to several weeks depending on whether all or only part of it is carried out.",
