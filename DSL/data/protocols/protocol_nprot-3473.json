            "content": "Up to now, 57 human genes coding for the various cytochrome P450 \\(CYP) enzymes have been characterized1. Binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \\(PAHs) and the other persistent organic pollutants \\(POPs) to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor \\(AHR), a ligand dependent transcription factor,  results in an induction of cytochrome P450 1A and their associated 7-ethoxy-resorufin-O-deethylase \\(EROD) activity 2. CYP1A genes are activated by AHR agonists via high affinity competitive binding to the receptor3. CYP1A enzymes are the most highly up-regulated and therefore often used as a marker to indicate AHR activation3. The CYP enzymes show cell-type-and tissue-specific expression patterns in human and animal tissues and seven members of the CYP1 enzyme family \\(e.g., CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1) are primarily involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics 4-8and several endogenous chemicals1,4. \r\n\n\nCYP1A is expressed predominantly in the liver, but it can be been found in the other organs such as kidney, skin, lung, adrenal, gonads and brain 9-11. The use of CYP1A induction as an assessment technique has increased in recent years. This is due mainly to the optimization of protocols for the rapid and relatively inexpensive measurement of its catalytic activity so-called EROD 12-14. As for most enzyme assays, the EROD activity can be normalized to the total protein values, the determination of which has clear limitations in high-throughput assays. The catalytic activity towards 7-ethoxyresorufin is measured as the concentration of resorufin produced per mg protein \\(pmol/min/mg protein) 15,16. In addition to the protein value, EROD activity can be normalized to the metabolic activity of the cells that can be measured by MTT, reszrusin and almar blue assays and expressed as metabolic cell equivalents based on the obtained data rather than to protein values17. It seems that the results of EROD activity normalized by protein value to some extent are comprable with the data normalized with cell viability \\(Figure 1). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAt present, the measurement of EROD activities in the primary and immortalized cell lines remains the preferred bioassay tool in many laboratories, because of the reproducible simultaneous determination of protein and resorufin concentrations. The EROD can be fluorimetrically detected in prepared microsomes from human and animal tissues 18-20. Indeed, fish gill EROD assay is a sensitive biomarker of exposure to POPs 21.\r\n\n\nEROD assay: principle\r\n\n\nEROD activity describes the rate of the CYP1A mediated deethylation of the substrate 7-ethoxyresorufin to form the product resorufin \\(Figure 2). \r\n\n\nEROD assay: applications\r\n\n\nOver two decades have passed since the induction of the CYP1A was proposed as a biomarker of exposure to PHHs and PAHs 22. Measurement of EROD activity in fish is a well-established in vivo biomarker of exposure to certain planar halogenated hydrocarbons \\(PHHs), PAHs and the other structurally similar compounds23. To study the fate of pharmaceutical residues, EROD assay is a rapid, accurate and cost effective method."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "The activity of the enzyme 7-ethoxy-resorufin-O-deethylase \\(EROD) has been extensively employed in biomonitoring studies of persistent organic pollutants \\(POPs) for more than a decade. Although the procedure is simple, convenient, sensitive and accurate. The cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 1A \\(CYP1A) is induced by several planar toxic compounds and endogenous chemicals, and the induction of this protein is often measured in terms of EROD activity. This protocol describes how to use EROD activity in the prediction of toxicity of chemicals in several models. The method can be employed in vitro and in vivo to assess the effects of drugs and toxic compounds on CYP1A1 enzyme. In aquatic biota EROD activity is a sensitive biomarker of exposure to certain planar halogenated hydrocarbons and the other structurally similar compounds. This method is rapid and the whole procedure takes no longer than 30 min including reagent preparation.",
