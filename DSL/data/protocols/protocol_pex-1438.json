            "content": "<p>High throughput sequencing of amplified marker gene sequences (barcodes) is a simple and rapid method of assessing the taxonomic composition of a complex microbial community. The \u201cmeta-barcoding\u201d approach is often based on amplification of one or more variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, however, this target often fails to provide species level resolution. The cpn60 gene (also known as groEL or hsp60) contains a 552-558 bp variable region (the cpn60 \u201cuniversal target\u201d) that can be amplified with \u201cuniversal\u201d PCR primers and this sequence has been demonstrated to meet the criteria as a barcode for Bacteria&nbsp;[1]. The sequence provides species level resolution and has been shown to be a good predictor of whole genome sequence similarities&nbsp;[2\u20136]. Since cpn60 is conserved in Bacteria, Eukaryotes and some Archaea, cpn60 barcode sequencing can be used for simultaneous detection of multiple Domains of life&nbsp;[7]. A public database of cpn60 sequences, cpnDB (www.cpndb.ca), facilitates the identification of cpn60 barcode sequences&nbsp;[8]. As a result of these features, cpn60 meta-barcode sequencing has been applied to the characterization of a wide variety of host-associated and environmental microbiomes&nbsp;[7, 9\u201314].</p><p><br></p><p>Amplicon sequencing methods are subject to a variety of sources of bias, including amplification primer bias. To minimize this effect of cpn60 amplification, we developed a primer \u201ccocktail\u201d approach to ensure amplification of cpn60 sequences from genomes with a wide range of G+C content&nbsp;[15]. Use of a single annealing temperature of&nbsp;60&nbsp;\u00b0C&nbsp;is appropriate for most samples, although practitioners may want to consider pooling PCR products produced across an annealing temperature gradient in some situations&nbsp;[16].</p><p><br></p><p>The protocol presented here is a modification of the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation (Part #15044223)&nbsp;[17]&nbsp;and describes the production of cpn60 amplicon libraries for sequencing on the MiSeq platform. The length of the amplicon prevents assembly of complete barcode sequences, but we have shown that as little as 150 bp from the 5\u2019 end of the barcode sequence is generally sufficient for species level identification&nbsp;[18]. We routinely use a 500 cycle sequencing kit but run it as 401x101 rather than 251x251 and use only the Read 1 sequences in downstream analysis.</p>"

Add 32.5 \u00b5l of NucleoMag beads to each well of the deepwell plate using a multi-channel pipette, changing tips after each transfer to prevent cross-contamination between samples.\n7. Seal the deepwell plate with a foil sealer and shake it in the plate-shaker at 1800 rpm for 2 minutes. (If a plate-shaker is not available, pipetting up and down 10 times using a multi-channel pipet is an alternative method for mixing)\n8. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 5 minutes.\n9. Put the deepwell plate on the magnetic stand for 2 minutes until the supernatant is clear.\n10. Using a multi-channel pipette, remove the supernatant while the PCR clean-up plate is sitting on the magnet. Change the tips in between the samples. If the beads get disturbed during the pipetting process, wait until they re-settle. Never throw away beads.\n11.

Incubate the PCR clean-up plate at room temperature for 2 minutes.\n23. Return the PCR clean-up plate to the magnet for 2 minutes until the supernatant is clear.\n24. Label a new PCR plate as \u201cNucleoMag bead cleaned cpn60 amplicon\u201d.\n25.

Change the tips in between the samples. If the beads get disturbed during the pipetting process, wait until they settle.\n26. Evaluate the cpn60 amplicons by running a randomly selected subset of NucleoMag cleaned amplicons in a 1% agarose gel. If there is a ~680 bp amplicon observed in the samples with the absence of primer dimers (Fig. 2), proceed to the index PCR step or store the plate at -20\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0for up to 1 week.\nC.

Calculate the total volume of NucleoMag beads needed (32.5\u00b5l per sample).\n4. Vortex the NucleoMag beads for 1 minute to resuspend and then add the required amount of NucleoMag beads to a reagent reservoir.\n5. Add 32.5\u00b5l of NucleoMag beads to each well using a multi-channel pipette, changing tips between samples.\n6. Seal the PCR clean-up plate with a foil sealer and shake it in the plate shaker at 1800 rpm for 2 minutes. (Pipetting up and down 10 times using a multi-channel pipet is the alternative method in the absence of a plate shaker)\n7. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 5 minutes to allow the amplicons to bind to the beads.\n8. Put the PCR clean-up plate on the magnetic stand for 2 minutes until the supernatant is clear.\n9.

Leave the PCR-clean up plate on the magnet for 10 minutes to dry the beads.\n17. Add sufficient volume of 10 mM Tris pH 8.5 to a reagent reservoir (27.5 \u00b5L.well).\n18. To elute the indexed amplicons from the beads, remove the PCR clean-up plate from the magnet and add 27.5 \u00b5l of 10mM Tris pH 8.5 to each well using a multi-channel pipette.\n19. Seal PCR clean-up plate using a foil plate sealer.\n20. Shake PCR clean-up plate using the plate shaker at 1800 rpm for 2 minutes.

If the beads get disturbed during the pipetting process, wait until they settle.\n25. Evaluate the indexed cpn60 PCR product by running a randomly selected subset of NucleoMag cleaned indexed cpn60 amplicons in a 1% agarose gel (see Fig. 2). Alternatively, dilute selected amplicon libraries 1:50 and assess on a Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity DNA chip (Fig. 4).\u00a0\u00a0If there is a ~730 bp amplicon observed with the absence of primer dimers (~200 bp), proceed immediately to the library quantification and pooling step (E) or store the cleaned-up indexed PCR products at -20\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0for up to 1 week.\nE.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>This protocol can be applied to determine the composition of a microbial community. The cpn60 gene (also known as groEL, hsp60) is present in almost all bacteria and a 552-558 bp region of the gene has been established as a barcode for species level identification of bacteria. The primer cocktail used in this protocol amplifies cpn60 barcode sequences from bacteria with a wide range of G+C content. Some species of&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma</em>&nbsp;lack the cpn60 gene and therefore this method is not recommended to detect&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma</em>. DNA sequences generated from this method could be compared to cpnDB, a public database of cpn60 sequences, for identification. Library preparation involves cpn60 amplicon generation, PCR clean-up, index PCR, index PCR clean-up, library quantification, normalization, pooling, library denaturation and loading. Time taken to complete depends on the number of samples included. If using 96 samples, the procedure takes 8 hours but there are several stages where the samples could be stored and continued the next day. Specific instructions are provided for the Illumina MiSeq platform, but the protocol could easily be adapted for other sequencing platforms.</p>",
