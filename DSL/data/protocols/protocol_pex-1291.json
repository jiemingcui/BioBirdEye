            "content": "<p>\tFour major types of human biomolecules include nucleic acids (including DNA and RNA), proteins, lipids and glycans. Unlike RNAs and proteins, glycan biosynthesis has no templates but depends on genes, nutrition, and other environmental factors in time and space[<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1</a>]. As results, animal glycome is estimated to be 10<sup>4</sup> times larger than the proteome[<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2-5</a>]. Glycans are abundantly present in blood circulations in patients suffering cancerous and non-cancerous diseases. Thus, glycans are rich source for biomarker discovery. However, nearly all studies of serum glycans as possible disease biomarkers have been focused on resolving complicated glycan structures by complicated glycan preparation procedures plus expensive instrumentations, such as LC-MS[<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>, <a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5-7</a>]. </p><p>\tDespite there are many different types of glycans [<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">8</a>], all human glycans consist of up to 10 monosaccharides, i.e. sialic acid (SA), N-acetyl galactosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetyl glucosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), mannose (Man), fucose (Fuc), glucose (Glc), xylose (Xyl), glucuronic acid (GlcA), and iduronic acid (Ido A). However, few methods have been developed to quantify glycan contents or monosaccharide compositions in human sera or plasmas.</p><p>\tThis protocol was originally developed from the corresponding author\u2019s laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis for glucosamine- and galactosamine-based, serum- or animal tissue-derived glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification purposes [<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9-13</a>]. We then discovered that significantly different quantity and compositions of glucosamine and galactosamine are present in the plasmas of human patients suffering lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers, respectively, [<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">10</a>, <a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">14</a>]. Since the major glycans in human sera/plasmas are N-linked and O-linked glycans instead of GAGs, we subsequently developed a HPLC method that can quantify all other monosaccharides in addition to glucosamine and galactosamine released from serum/plasma glycans simultaneously[<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">15-18</a>] for biomarker development. &nbsp;</p><p>\tReleasing monosaccharides from serum/plasma glycans is the bottleneck of monosaccharide composition analysis[<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">19</a>, <a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">20</a>]. It is usually conducted in a sealed glass ampoule at 105\u2013120 \u00b0C for 1\u20136 h[<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">21</a>] or in a PicoTag station[<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">10</a>]. To enhance the efficiency of the acid hydrolysis, we previously developed a MAAH coupled HPAEC-PAD analysis for monosaccharide composition analysis of 7 different types of polysaccharides[<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">22</a>]. In current study, we optimized the acid hydrolysis condition for releasing glycan monosaccharides from serum/plasma samples and the monosaccharide compositions are then obtained by HPAEC-PAD analysis.&nbsp;</p>"

Our ultimate goal is to use the microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis for serum/plasma monosaccharide composition analysis.</p><p><strong>The effects of microwave power on monosaccharide standards</strong></p><p>\tTo test the effect of microwave power on monosaccharide standards, the established microwave conditions (100 W at 100\u00b0C for 10 min) without 3 mol/L HCl, are applied to 0.1 mg/ml mixed six monosaccharide standards. The t-test was performed on the A (no-microwave) and B (microwave) groups containing the 6 monosaccharide standards. We found that <strong>(Figure 1)</strong> there is no significant difference between the two group (<em>p &gt; 0.05</em>), indicating that the microwave-power itself has no effect on both physical and chemical properties of each of the monosaccharides in the mixture at the condition of 100 W at 100\u00b0C for 10 min.</p><p><strong>The effect of HCl concentrations on serum MAAH</strong></p><p>\tSince the glycans in the serum/plasma samples are present as thousand different kinds of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are not pure polysaccahrides as those used in our previous publication [<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">15</a>], we tested the best HCl concentrations that should be used for microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis of serum/plasma samples.</p><p>\tWe first made a serum pool by combining 100 \u03bcL serum from each of 10 kidney cancer patients. Two \u03bcL serum x 6 from the serum pool are taken and 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mol/L HCl (final concentration) are used for acid hydrolysis under the condition of 100 W at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min, respectively. The resulting supernatant at each HCl concentration is analyzed by HPAEC-PAD. The ion chromatogram is shown in <strong>Figure 2a</strong>. The experiment is repeated three times. The average peak areas of each monosaccharide obtained from the serum pool is calculated. We found that 4 mol/L HCl produces the highest yield of two basic monosaccharides (GalN and GlcN) but with less neutral monosaccharides (Fuc, Gal, Glc, and Man). In contrast, 2 mol/L HCl only partially releases the two basic monosaccharides (GalN and GlcN). We concluded that 3 mol/L HCl keeps a balance in releasing both basic and neutral monosaccharides <strong>(Figure 2b).&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The best volume of serum/plasma samples required for monosaccharide composition analysis</strong></p><p>\tIn searching for the best volume of serum samples for monosaccharide composition analysis, we made another serum pool by combining 100 \u03bcL serum from each of 10 uremia patients. In triplicate, 2, 5 or 10 \u03bcL sera from the serum pool are used for acid hydrolysis under the condition of 3 mol/L HCl, 100 W at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min, respectively. The resulting supernatant is analyzed by HPAEC-PAD. The ion chromatogram of serum monosaccharides of the serum pool is shown in <strong>Figure 3a</strong>. Under the same acid hydrolysis conditions, we found that the content of monosaccharides is increased with increased amount of sera used but the increase is not linear. We decided to use 2 mL serum for MAAH coupled HPAEC-PAD analyses for two reasons: 1. two mL serum is sufficient for detecting all six monosaccharides; 2. For certain diabetic patients, the glucose peak becomes platooned by hitting the up-limit of PAD detection if 5 \u03bcL serum is used.</p><p><strong>Repeatability of the optimized MAAH coupled HPAEC-PAD analysis</strong></p><p>\tWe next determined the reproducibility of the optimized condition of 3 mol/L HCl, 100 W at 100\u00b0C for 10 min for monosaccharide composition analysis of 2 ml of serum sample from a kidney cancer patient.

The optimized acid hydrolysis of serum/plasma samples takes only 10 min and 10 \u03bcl of acid and 2 \u03bcl serum/plasma samples. The monosaccharide composition analysis is subsequently accomplished by HPAEC-PAD analysis. Each step of the experimental procedures has been optimized with repeated tests of monosaccharide standards and serum samples. The described workflow takes approximately 70-90 min, up to 48 serum/plasma samples can be analyzed with one HPAEC-PAD instrument per day.</p>",
