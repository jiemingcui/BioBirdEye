            "content": "<p><strong>Microscope</strong></p><p>For high-precision measurements, a research-grade microscope on a vibration isolation table is needed.&nbsp;For rapid measurements, high illumination intensities are necessary, though laser powers will vary widely depending on how they are configured to illuminate the sample, the illumination area, the imaging speed, and the sample fluorescence intensity.&nbsp;While there are many suitable combinations available, our 3D imaging system includes the following items within the microscope set-up (<strong>NCB Figure 1a</strong>), with major systems described in the sections that follow:</p><p>Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope (motorized)</p><p>100X oil-immersion objective (Zeiss Alpha Plan-Apochromat, 1.40 NA)</p><p>Metamorph 7.7.7 image acquisition software</p><p>Motorized <em>xy</em> microstage, 25 mm range each axis (Mad City Labs, #Micro-Stage)</p><p>Piezo <em>xyz</em> nanostage, 200 \u00b5m range each axis, 0.2 nm

imaging</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This procedure assumes that the user is sufficiently capable of assembling and operating a microscope with the above components, or that someone is available to provide the necessary expertise.&nbsp;In our microscope, the lasers are combined in free space on a vibration isolation table, and collimated into a beam expander to generate the ~6 mm diameter Gaussian beam required by the \u03c0-shaper beam flattener.&nbsp;The \u03c0-shaper creates a nearly flat sample plane illumination profile (rather than a Gaussian spot).&nbsp;The size of the illumination area at the image plane (~7 \u00b5m diameter in our experiments) is controlled by a beam compressor after the \u03c0-shaper.&nbsp;To maximize excitation efficiency, the polarized laser beams are converted to circularly polarized light with the half (\u03bb/2) and a quarter (\u03bb/4) waveplates.&nbsp;The slightly converging illumination beam enters the microscope through the epifluorescence excitation path from which all manufacturer-installed optics before the dichroic mirror were removed, except for the tube lens.&nbsp;These optics were removed to simplify the installation of the TIRF-lock system (described later).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sample Chambers</strong></p><p>#1.5 coverslips, 24x60 mm (VWR, #16004-312)</p><p>#1.5 coverslips, 10.5x35 mm (Electron Microscopy Sciences, #72191-35)</p><p>High vacuum grease (Dow Corning, #DOWCOR), in syringe with pipette tip nozzle</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For ease of adding and removing reagents, flow chambers (~10 \u00b5L) should be constructed by inverting a small coverslip (10.5x35 mm) with beads of high-vacuum grease parallel to the short edges over a coverslip (24x60 mm) on which adherent cells were grown overnight (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).&nbsp;The coverslip sandwich is then mounted into a homemade aluminum frame slide holder, and held in place by high-vacuum grease.&nbsp;To exchange buffer within a flow chamber, ~10 \u00b5L of the desired solution is added to one side (high-vacuum grease can be used to make a reservoir \u2013 see <strong>Figure 1d</strong>), and then a small piece of filter paper is used to extract the solution from the chamber from the other side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sample Mounting System</strong></p><p>Microscope and sample chamber stability is critical to high precision spatial measurements.&nbsp;Air currents are particularly disruptive.&nbsp;Our solution is illustrated in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.&nbsp;To hold our homemade slide holder, we constructed a rectangular hollowed plate, and mounted it within the screw-mounted manufacturer-supplied frame within the piezo nanostage.&nbsp;The slide holder with coverslip and flow-chambers is then placed within the hollowed plate, and held tightly in place by two clamps.&nbsp;The slide is thus suspended within the piezo stage, which protects it from the four sides.&nbsp;The slide and holder effectively seals the chamber from the bottom, and a gel plate (0.75 mm thickness, from an SDS-PAGE system) placed on top of sample holder completes the enclosure, effectively minimizing disturbances from air currents.&nbsp;In this set-up, the sample chamber is not temperature controlled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Z</em>-Lock System</strong></p><p>A self-configured TIRF-Lock system (Mad City Labs) provides a <em>z</em>-stability for the coverslip of &lt; 3 nm for the duration of the experiment.&nbsp;The system is designed so that an infra-red (IR) laser (850 nm, 20 mW; Thorlabs, #LDM850) undergoes total internal reflection (TIR) at the glass (coverslip)-sample (aqueous) interface.&nbsp;The reflected beam is focused onto a quadrant photo-diode detector (which comes with the TIRF-Lock system).&nbsp;Any <em>z</em>-drift of the coverslip (approximately parallel to the focal plane) causes a displacement of the TIR beam on the detector, which is compensated by calibrated movement of the nanostage through a software-controlled manufacturer-provided feedback system.&nbsp;In our system, the IR beam was directed to the coverslip via the epifluorescence beam path, and returned to the detector via the same path.&nbsp;For this to work, it is critical to ensure that any optics in the path are transparent to IR light.&nbsp;This was not the case for our Zeiss microscope system.&nbsp;Consequently, all of the optical elements within the epifluorescence illumination path, except for the tube lens, were removed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adaptive Optics (AO) System</strong></p><p>An adaptive optics (AO) system is needed to correct for aberrations (primarily spherical aberrations introduced by the aqueous sample) and to introduce the astigmatism necessary for 3D imaging.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;A suitable AO system should be incorporated into an emission path of the microscope.&nbsp;For our setup, we used a self-configurable system (Imagine Optic, AO KIT BIO), which includes the following:</p><p>Deformable mirror (DM) (MirAO 52-e)</p><p>Wavefront sensor (WFS) (HASO4)</p><p>Software to run the DM and WFS (MicAO Soft)</p><p>Software development kit (Wavekit Bio)</p><p>This self-configurable system was used instead of the plug-and-play device available from the same manufacturer so that switching between the wavefront sensor (WFS; required for calibration of the deformable mirror, DM) and the camera could be readily achieved with an electronically controlled flip mirror.&nbsp;This is important for daily optimization of the wavefront without physically moving hardware.&nbsp;Critical parts of the assembly are described below and illustrated in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.&nbsp;Optics expertise is essential; this is not an approach recommended for a novice.&nbsp;An appropriately designed plug-and-play device may be suitable for some applications, avoiding the set-up described in the following paragraph.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To obtain optimized and well-corrected point spread functions (PSFs), it is essential to construct the imaging system from high-quality, chromatically-corrected optics, and firmly mount them in a stable positioning system.&nbsp;In all microscope imaging systems, there are a series of conjugate image and aperture planes separated by the various lens elements.&nbsp;The DM and WFS both need to be placed at conjugate aperture planes (alternately termed pupil planes).&nbsp;Knowing that the camera chip is positioned at the image plane when the camera is mounted on the microscope determines where the first lens (L1) is positioned, i.e. at its focal length distance from this image plane.&nbsp;The focal length of L1 is determined from the focal length of the microscope tube lens used to create the initial image (165 mm for our Zeiss microscope), the diameter of the back focal plane of the objective, and the size of the spot needed on the DM.&nbsp;This spot should maximally fill (but not over-fill) the 15 mm diameter surface of the DM to effectively make use of most of the actuators generating the mirror deformations. The diameter of the back focal plane of the objective \u2013 in our case, this is ~5 mm (Plan-Apochromat 100x/1.40 Oil, Zeiss, #420792-9901-000) is needed for determining the necessary magnification.&nbsp;Using a 400 mm lens (Thorlabs, #TL400-A), we obtained a magnification of 2.42X (= 400 mm/165 mm) yielding a spot of ~12 mm diameter on the DM.&nbsp;This spot is readily visible by illuminating the sample plane with transmitted light and a fully open illumination aperture.&nbsp;Such illumination is readily used for positioning and aligning the optical elements of the system.&nbsp;A second lens L2 (focal length identical to L1) regenerates the image, and determines the placement of the camera.&nbsp;In our system, we have an Optosplit III before the camera, which enables three different colors to be imaged simultaneously on different parts of the camera.&nbsp;This feature was not used, and is not needed, for imaging cargo transport through NPCs.&nbsp;A flip mirror installed between L2 and the camera is used to divert the beam into the WFS via a third lens L3 (Thorlabs, #TL-100A).&nbsp;This flip mirror (automated if desired) allows simple and rapid switching between calibration mode (WFS) and imaging (camera).&nbsp;Alignment is critical so that the aperture plane on the WFS is conjugate to the plane on the DM.&nbsp;As the WFS has a smaller imaging area (3.6 x 4.6 mm) than the DM, the spot diameter needs to be reduced about 4-fold.&nbsp;This is accomplished in our system with a 100 mm focal length lens (L3).&nbsp;</p>"

different amounts of dye to aliquots of protein sufficient to run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and then analyze these labeled proteins by in-gel fluorescence imaging.\u00a0For labeling protein stocks, the minimum amount of dye need to obtain saturated (quantitative) labeling is typically used.\u00a0Maleimides are highly reactive with cysteines, and a 5-10 min incubation period is sufficient to reach the reaction endpoint.\u00a0The following procedures yield high labeling efficiencies.\nHMSiR maleimide is attached to the C-terminal cysteine on the LaG-9(S151C) nanobody by incubating with a 15-fold molar excess at room temperature for 15 min.\u00a0Excess dye is washed away by binding the nanobody to Ni-NTA resin:\n1)\u00a0\u00a0Incubate the dye-protein mixture with 0.1 mL Ni-NTA resin for 30 min.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0Wash the resin-bound protein with 20 mL of 20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% TX-100, 4 mM BME, pH 7.3.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0Wash with 10 mL of 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.3 to remove the detergent.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0Elute the labeled nanobody with 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.3 collecting 50 \u00b5L fractions.\nThe eight surface cysteines on M9-\u03b2Gal-8C and four surface cysteines on Imp \u237a should be efficiently labeled with a 150- and 70-fold molar excess of Atto542 maleimide, respectively.\u00a0Excess dye is then removed by the same procedure as for the HMSiR dye, except that 5 mL is sufficient for the first wash step.\nCell Culture\nThis procedure assumes competence in routine mammalian cell culture techniques.\u00a0Cells are cultured in McCoy\u2019s 5A (modified) media supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1X MEM non-essential amino acids solution, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in 5% (v/v) CO\n2\nenriched air at 37\u00baC.\u00a0For culture maintenance, cells should be grown to ~95% confluency, and split using Accutase.\u00a0Cells should be tested monthly for mycoplasma contamination.\u00a0For microscopy experiments, cells should be split the night before and diluted to < 3% confluency onto coverslips (24x60 mm; see \u2018Sample Chambers\u2019 section) pre-treated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine for 5 min.\u00a0The poly-lysine treatment is important to reduce cell detachment after permeabilization.\nFor these experiments, U-2 OS-CRISPR-NUP96-mEGFP cells should be used.\u00a0The EGFP tags on the 32 copies of NUP96 within the NPC scaffold provide the necessary binding sites for blinking dye-labeled anti-GFP nanobodies, which provides the stochastic and bright fluorescence needed to generate super-resolution images of individual NPCs.\nAgarose Immobilized Fluorescent Beads\nA slide containing immobilized fluorescent microspheres is used for obtaining calibration and precision data, and should be formed as follows.\u00a0Into each chamber of a 4-well glass bottomed coverslip (Ibidi, #80447), add 150 \u00b5L of a mixture of 1 \u00b5m and 0.1 \u00b5m Tetraspeck microspheres diluted into autoclaved distilled water [1:40 and 1:1000 dilution (v/v), respectively].\u00a0Then, 200 \u00b5L of 2% preheated and cleared agarose solution in autoclaved water is added to each chamber and allowed to cool and solidify.\u00a0The top cover should be sealed with parafilm to prevent the agarose from drying out.\u00a0This slide with immobilized microspheres can be stored in the microscope room and re-used numerous times.\u00a0For longer term stability, store in a refrigerator, warming up to room temperature for 15 min before use.\nIMAGING PROCEDURES\nAO Calibration\n(~45 min)\nFor an optimal PSF, the AO system needs to be calibrated on the day of the experiment.\u00a0The aberrations introduced by the imaging optics are corrected using a two-step approach.\u00a0It is assumed that the optical elements within the AO system are properly aligned.\u00a0This will be the case if the emission from a 1 \u00b5m fluorescent bead is visible as an array of spots on the WFS.\u00a0These spots arise from a set of equally-spaced microlenses focusing the beam onto a CCD chip within the Shack-Hartmann WFS.\n28\n1)\u00a0\u00a0The first step of the calibration procedure (rough calibration) requires using a software-driven iterative process to alter the shape of the DM until an optimized flat wavefront is obtained (manufacturer-provided software).\u00a0Physically, this is observed as a correction to the spacing between the spots imaged by the WFS to yield (nearly) identical\nx\nand\ny\ndistances between the spots.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0For the second calibration step (fine tuning), the emission path should be changed to project the emission from a 0.1 \u00b5m bead onto the imaging camera instead of the WFS.\u00a0A software-driven iterative process is then used to adjust the DM to achieve the highest quality image on the imaging camera (diffraction-limited round spot when in focus), using an algorithm based on an intensity-based merit factor.\n29\nIn practice, the rough calibration is not needed on a daily basis and the image-based calibration is sufficient, but it is good practice to recalibrate with the WFS on a regular basis (e.g., weekly).\u00a0With an optimized PSF, the astigmatism needed (we use 60 nm rms astigmatism) is added to the calibrated DM settings, and the sample is then imaged.\nCell Preparation for Imaging\n(~10 min)\nWhen ready to begin imaging experiments, mount the coverslip with cells grown overnight into the aluminum holder and create flow chambers, as described under Imaging System (Sample Chambers):\n1)\u00a0\u00a0Permeabilize the cells by incubating with 40 \u00b5g/mL digitonin in import buffer (IB; 20 mM HEPES, 110 mM KOAc, 5 mM NaOAc, 2 mM MgOAc\n2\n, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.3) for 2 min.\nNote:\nthe timing is important here, as the nuclei will swell significantly without osmotic balance, possibility even filling the entire cytoplasmic compartment.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0Wash the permeabilized cells once with 10 \u00b5L IB + 1.2% (w/v) PVP (IB-PVP).\nNote:\nthe 1.2% PVP provides the necessary osmotic balance to prevent the nuclei from swelling (and must be a high molecular weight PVP to prevent diffusion through NPCs).\u00a0The percentage used can vary depending on cell line.\u00a0This can be checked by adding different percentages of PVP and checking whether the nuclei swell, shrink, or stay the same size.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0Add 10 \u00b5L of 100 nM LaG-9(S151C-HMSiR) in IB-PVP to the permeabilized cells, and incubate for 3 min.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0Wash the cells twice with 10 \u00b5L IB-PVP.\nThe cells are now ready for experiments, and should be used within ~5 min.\u00a0The time clock for import experiment begins when the appropriate transport mix is added.\nNPC Data Acquisition\n(~20 min)\nWhile the NPCs in the permeabilized cell system are initially highly stabilized on the nanoscale, the ideal imaging window is the first 15-20 min after the nanobody decoration step, as the nuclei will begin to jiggle and detach from the surface at around 30-45 min.\u00a0To this end, it is important to be prepared to initiate the import reaction shortly after the nanobody wash step by adding the desired transport mix, which should include the desired concentration of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs; e.g., Imp \u237a, Imp \u03b21, or Imp \u03b22), cargo (e.g., NLS-2xBFP or M9-\u03b2Gal-8C), NTF2 (the transport receptor for RanGDP\n30\n), RanGDP, and GTP in IB. Suggested concentrations are 0.5-2 \u00b5M for NTRs, RanGDP, and cargos, 1 mM for GTP, and 1 nM for the fluorescently labeled (tracked) protein (see associated publication).\n1)\u00a0\u00a0When ready, the transport mix (~10 \u00b5L) is flowed into the desired chamber with the nanobody-decorated NPCs.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0To allow the sample to stabilize and the RanGTP/RanGDP gradient to be established across the nuclear envelope, image acquisition should be delayed for ~1 min.\n31\nImage sequences for NPC localizations (red channel, ~8 min total time; e.g., fourteen 500-frame movies with a 5 s gap between movies, 50 ms/frame, \u03bb\nex\n= 647 nm, 3 kW/cm\n2\n) and cargo translocation (green channel, ~2 min total time; e.g., fifty 1000-frame movies, 2-3 ms/frame, \u03bb\nex\n= 532 nm, 50-100 kW/cm\n2\n) should then be sequentially acquired.\nAcquisition of the two separate colors can occur in either order.\u00a0A major advantage of the AO system is that any chromatic aberrations (different colors focusing at different points along the optical axis) can be compensated by applying an appropriate defocus when switching channels (in our system, a 30 nm rms defocus is used).\u00a0Applying such a defocus is recommended so that the precisions within the two color channels scale similarly.\u00a0If the green channel is imaged first, note that higher 532 nm excitation intensities required for faster image acquisition will result in some photobleaching of the HMSiR dye.\u00a0If the red channel is imaged first, background fluorescence from inside the nucleus from already imported molecules can be expected, which will likely require photobleaching before the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough to obtain data with an acceptable signal-to-background ratio.\nData for\nz\n-Calibration and Image Alignment\n(15 min)\nImmediately after acquiring cargo transport and NPC localization data, image sequences necessary to obtain\nz\n-calibration curves for each color and to calculate an image alignment matrix should be obtained.\u00a0As each experiment typically has different optimized DM settings, these calibrations should be performed for every nucleus (one nuclear envelope imaged per experiment).\u00a0For both sets of data, at least five different 0.1 \u00b5m beads embedded in 2% agarose should be imaged in both green and red channels.\u00a0These small beads are bright, take a long time to photobleach, and yield a diffraction-limited spot that well-approximates that of a fluorescent protein particle.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0For the\nz\n-calibration curves,\nz\n-stack image sequences of a bead near the origin (center of the frame) should be obtained for both green and red channels (e.g., 5 sequences, 100 ms/frame, 41 steps, step size of 25 nm).\n2)\u00a0\u00a0For calculating the image alignment matrix, sets of image sequences (e.g., 5 sequences, 100 frames each, 50 ms/frame) for different beads should be acquired separately in the different channels. To better sample the field, one bead should be imaged near the origin, and one bead imaged in each quadrant.\u00a0For larger imaging fields, an alternate sampling strategy involving more beads may be necessary.\nRemember to apply any necessary chromatic defocus when imaging channels are switched.\nData for\nxyz\nPrecision\n(1 hr)\nImage sequences of 0.1 \u00b5m beads such as those described earlier for calculating the image alignment matrix should be collected for a range of\nz\npositions (e.g., 0\u00b1300 nm) and photon intensities (e.g., 1000-4000 photons/spot).\u00a0Images at multiple tens of different\nz\npositions are recommended collected with at least two distinct photon levels.  These data for determining precision need to be collected only once, whereas the\nz\n-calibration and image alignment data need to be collected for every nucleus.\nDATA ANALYSIS\nThese analyses will require a series of Matlab scripts (identified with quotation marks, \u201c\u201d), which are available from Github (\nhttps://github.com/npctat2021/npc3d2021\n) and described in\nNCB Supplementary Table 1\n.\nSpot Identification and 3D Localization\n(For each nucleus, ~10 min for the NPC scaffold and ~6 hr for the cargo complexes)\nThe first stage of data analysis requires determining the\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\ncoordinates of the single particle spots recorded in the image sequences of interest.\u00a0Obtaining these coordinates is readily accomplished using Fiji (a bundled package of ImageJ including numerous plugins for image analysis)\n32\nwith the ThunderSTORM\n33\nplug-in.\u00a0The maximum likelihood (MLE) method is recommended for determining all single molecule localizations.\u00a0A\nz\n-calibration curve is first obtained from the\nz\n-stack images of 0.1 \u00b5m beads obtained after the nuclear import data was collected.\u00a0Since the astigmatism introduced by the DM results in elongation of the spot intensity along\nx\nor\ny\ndepending on\nz\nposition, fitting the distribution of the differences in the spot widths in\nx\nand\ny\nas a function of\nz\nyields a\nz\n-calibration curve (\nNCB Figures 1d,e\n).\n21\nThe ThunderSTORM plug-in calculates this calibration curve from an input\nz\n-stack of images of beads using a revised algorithm.\u00a0With this\nz\n-calibration curve, the\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\ncoordinates of particle positions in the nuclear import datasets can be generated.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0Open the calibration\nz\n-stack image sequence (in a single file) in Fiji.\u00a0Under the \u2018Thunder STORM\u2019 plugin, click on \u20183D calibration\u2019.\u00a0Set to \u2018no filter\u2019, \u2018local maximum\u2019, \u2018maximum likelihood\u2019, \u2018ThunderSTORM\u2019 defocus model, and other parameters as appropriate.\u00a0Click \u2018OK\u2019, and save the calibration file.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0Open the image sequence to analyze in Fiji.\u00a0Under the \u2018Thunder STORM\u2019 plugin, click on \u2018Run analysis\u2019.\u00a0Set to \u2018no filter\u2019, \u2018local maximum\u2019, \u2018PSF: Elliptical Gaussian (3D astigmatism)\u2019, \u2018maximum likelihood\u2019, and other parameters as appropriate.\u00a0The calibration file needed is the one generated in step 1.\u00a0Click \u2018OK\u2019, and the \u2018ThunderSTORM:results\u2019 output window will appear.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0In the \u2018ThunderSTORM:results\u2019 output window, the data should be filtered as follows.\nFor all data:\nRun the \u201cremove duplicates\u201d script to eliminate those localizations that are too close (uncertainty threshold set to 5 nm).\nFor the NPC scaffold (nanobody) data:\nRun the \u201cdensity filters\u201d script to eliminate those localizations in low density areas, i.e., between clustered localizations (minimum of 10 localizations in a cylinder with a 110 nm radius) arising from individual NPCs.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0After filtering, the minimum information needed will be the spot centroids (\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\ncoordinates), the spot widths in\nx\nand\ny\n, the number of photons/spot, and the frame number in the image sequence.\u00a0This information is exported to a .csv file (that can be opened in Microsoft Excel) to be used for subsequent analysis.\nPrecision\n(1-2 hr)\n1)\u00a0\u00a0Calculate the\nxyz\nprecision as follows.\u00a0Using ThunderSTORM, determine the\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\ncoordinates of 0.1 \u00b5m beads in the 100 frame image sequences collected earlier at different\nz\npositions.\u00a0Then, calculate the standard deviation of the position measurements.\u00a0These standard deviations of the measured positions in\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\nare the estimated precisions in\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\n.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0Plot the\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\nprecisions as a function of\nz\nposition.\u00a0Since precision scales by (1/\nN\np\n)\n1/2\n, where\nN\np\nis the number of photons collected, the measured precision should be scaled to a standard value by multiplying the precision obtained for each particle by (\nN\np\n/\nN\nr\n)\n1/2\n, where\nN\nr\nis the reference photon level.\u00a0We typically calibrated precision curves to 3000 photons (\nNCB Figure 1f\n), the minimum photon level arising from the fluorescence of single molecules of HMSiR used to generate the NPC scaffold.\nImage Alignment\n(30 min)\nA reference channel needs to be determined, and all coordinates transformed into this coordinate system.\u00a0In the following, we assume that the red channel (NUP96-nanobody localizations) is the reference, and that the green channel (cargo complex localizations) coordinates must be converted to the red channel coordinate system.\u00a0This was accomplished by applying two successive corrections to the green channel coordinates, first to\nx\nand\ny\nand then to\nz\n.\nImage Alignment in x and y\n1)\u00a0\u00a0The mean\nx\nand\ny\ncoordinates of the 0.1 \u00b5m beads in the 100-frame images sequences recorded earlier should be obtained with ThunderSTORM for both color channels.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0The\nxy\nalignment matrix to transform the\nx\nand\ny\ngreen channel coordinates into red channel coordinates is obtained as described earlier,\n34\nusing rotational and translational corrections.\u00a0This is accomplished by using a non-linear least-squares fitting routine (Matlab script \u201cgreen2red_transfer_matrix\u201d) to determine the best angular and translational corrections to convert the set of green channel coordinates into a corresponding set of red channel coordinates.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0Calculate the standard deviation of the differences between the transformed green channel coordinates and the measured red channel coordinates.\u00a0This standard deviation is defined as the alignment precision in\nx\nand\ny\n.\u00a0For our system, these were typically ~0.1-2 nm for both\nx\nand\ny\n.\u00a0For some optical systems, particularly those with larger imaging areas, a larger number of alignment points and/or a more complex alignment algorithm may be needed.\nImage Alignment in z\nWhile the AO is used to roughly align the\nz\n-focus of the two imaging channels, accurate alignment in\nz\nrequires the use of distinct\nz\n-calibration curves for the two color channels, and an estimate of the distance between these two approximately parallel curves.\u00a0As discussed in the Spot Identification and 3D Localization section, ThunderSTORM calculates the\nz\n-calibration curve from input image stacks; the output\nz\nvalues are zeroed to the crossing point of the\nx\nand\ny\nspot width curves (\nNCB Figure 1d\n).\u00a0The difference between these crossing points for the two channels in the laboratory\nz\ncoordinate needs to be estimated to align the images in\nz\n.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0Calculate the average difference in the mean\nz\n-position in the laboratory frame for the 0.1 \u00b5m beads in the 100-frame images sequences recorded earlier for both color channels. This average difference in mean\nz\n-position is the correction needed to convert the\nz\n-coordinate in the green channel to the\nz\n-coordinate in the red channel.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0Calculate the standard deviation of the difference in mean\nz\n-position.\u00a0This value is considered to be the\nz\n-alignment precision.\u00a0For our system, this was typically ~3-7 nm.\nDouble Ring Structure of the NPC Scaffold\n(1 hr per nucleus)\nThe fluorescent spots obtained from the HMSiR-labeled nanobody should yield recognizable clusters, which are individual NPCs.\u00a0To obtain an averaged double-ring structure of the NPC scaffold, the data are curated and analyzed as described below.\u00a0The starting input data is an Excel spreadsheet (\u201craw image data.csv\u201d) that minimally has four columns (the\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\ncoordinates and the photon counts) for the fluorescence spots as identified through ThunderSTORM analysis.\u00a0The row numbers correspond to frame numbers.\u00a0Matlab scripts are identified with quotation marks (\u201c\u201d).\n1)\u00a0\u00a0Run \u201cphotonandz_filter\u201d to filter out only those localizations with\nz\n= 0\u00b1300 nm, and for which the photon count is \u2265 3000.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0Use \u201ccircular_roi\u201d to select clusters (\u2265 10 localizations) based on reasonable roundness and size (i.e., located within a circular\nxy\ndiameter = 60-150 nm).\n3)\u00a0\u00a0Extract the coordinates and photon counts of individual clusters into separate text files using \u201cseparate_pores\u201d.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0Fit the localizations in each of the individual clusters to a double circle model using \u201cestimate_cylinder\u201d, which yields the centroid (\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n), the diameter of the circles (both the same) and the distance between the circles (height of the scaffold).\u00a0This model assumes that the NPCs are not tilted from the\nz\naxis.\n5)\u00a0\u00a0Run \u201cselect_pores\u201d to identify those clusters having at least 10 points with a diameter of 80-135 nm, a height of 40-65 nm, and a\nz\n-center of 0\u00b1200 nm, as determined by the double-circle fit algorithm (\u201cestimate_cylinder\u201d).\n6)\u00a0\u00a0To remove outliers, run \u201ccirclefit_bisquare\u201d.\u00a0This script first fits all cluster localizations to a circle in the\nxy\n-plane (i.e., ignoring the\nz\ncoordinate).\u00a0Then, this script calculates the mean\nxy\ndistance to the circle for all localizations (residuals), as well as the standard deviation of the residuals, and eliminates those localizations whose residual is more than two standard deviations of the residuals.\u00a0In practice, very few clusters should have points eliminated by this circle fitting process.\u00a0If any points are eliminated from a cluster, the \u201cestimate_cylinder\u201d and \u201cselect_pores\u201d scripts should be re-run with the remaining points of the cluster.\n7)\u00a0\u00a0Using \u201ccentering_pore_step5\u201d, the localizations for all the clusters should then be translated in\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\nto the origin (0, 0, 0) by aligning the centroids determined from the double circle fit.\u00a0The result is the unrotated NPC scaffold.\nRotation of the NPC Scaffold\n(15 min per nucleus)\nTo extract the 8-fold rotational symmetry of the NPC scaffold, the individual NPC data used to generate the unrotated scaffold needs to be rotated by a phase angle before aligning all the clusters.\u00a0The assumed 8-fold rotational symmetry predicts an oscillating intensity within the scaffold rings with a period of 45\u00ba.\u00a0There are insufficient data points within individually localized clusters to establish this pattern within the entire ring.\u00a0Instead, the periodic nature of the expected localizations is taken advantage of by determining the angle of each point in a cluster (NPC) relative to the relevant compass point (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0, etc.) assuming clockwise rotation around the centroid (the\nz\ncoordinate is ignored).\u00a0The phase angle is then determined from this compressed angular dataset.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0Identify the quadrant for the angle of each localization using \u201cpore_rotation_step1\u201d, which identifies the angles as 0-90\u00ba.\u00a0Then, subtract 45\u00b0 from the angles > 45\u00b0 using \u201cpore_rotation_step2\u201d, generating a set of angles 0-45\u00ba.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0Generate the angle distribution histogram (0-45\u00ba) of the localizations in each cluster with a bin of 5\u00ba using \u201cpore_rotation_step3\u201d.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0Estimate the phase angle of the cluster using \u201cpore_rotation_step4_fitting\u201d to fit the angle distribution histogram to a sinusoidal function with a period of 45\u00b0 and a variable phase.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0Translate the center (centroid) of each cluster to the origin using \u201ccentering_pore_step5\u201d.\n5)\u00a0\u00a0Rotate every point in a cluster about its centroid by the estimated phase angle using \u201cpore_rotation_step6\u201d.\n6)\u00a0\u00a0Merge the rotated clusters using \u201cmerge_after_rotation_step7\u201d.\u00a0The result is the rotated NPC scaffold.\nAlignment of Cargo Localizations with NPCs\n(~20 min per nucleus)\nHaving determined the location and relative orientation of individual NPCs, the fluorescent spots obtained from cargo complexes undergoing transport can be aligned with those NPCs.\u00a0The starting input data is an Excel spreadsheet (e.g., \u201call green spots.csv\u201d) that has a minimum of four columns (the\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\ncoordinates and the photon counts) of the fluorescence spots obtained through ThunderSTORM analysis.\u00a0The row numbers correspond to frame numbers.\n1)\u00a0\u00a0Curate the dataset with \u201cphoton_based_filter\u201d, which retains only those localizations for which the number of photons collected was \u2265 1000.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0Transform the\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\ncoordinates into red channel coordinates using \u201cgreen_localization_in_red_channel\u201d using the previously calculated image alignment matrix.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0Identify all cargo localizations within a 400 nm cube centered on an NPC centroid using \u201ctrack_localize_whole_roi\u201d.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0Align the cargo localizations into the averaged NPC scaffold via\nxyz\ntranslation and then rotation based on the pore that they are closest to (the 400 nm cube) using \u201ccentering_tracks_wrt_whole\u201d and \u201ctrack_rotation_in_whole\u201d.\nAnalysis and Identification of Trajectories\n(variable time, depending on experimental question; ~1.5 hr for trajectory categorization per nucleus)\nHaving aligned the cargo complex localizations with the averaged NPC scaffold, the data can then be analyzed as desired.\u00a0Cargo localizations found in multiple successive frames associated with the same NPC can be assumed to represent the same molecule.\u00a0We defined trajectories as three or more consecutive localizations.\u00a0Three consecutive localizations is the minimum number needed to define import, abortive import, export and abortive export, as such categorization requires knowing the initial and eventual compartment as well as confirming that the molecule was bound to the NPC.\u00a0We separated trajectories into such categories manually."

                "legend": "Procedure for Constructing Coverslip Flow Chambers.  a, Preparing the top coverslip.  A syringe with a pipet tip attached via numerous wrappings of parafilm is filled with high vacuum grease.  Beads of grease are squeezed out onto a 10.5x35 mm coverslip.  b, Mounting the coverslip.  A coverslip (24x60 mm) is mounted in an aluminum frame holder that fits in the microscope mounting system.  The coverslip is held in place by two strips of high vacuum grease underneath the left and right edges.  Shown here is a clean slide for clarity.  In practice, this coverslip would have cells grown overnight directly on the coverslip, and therefore would be wet.  c, Building the coverslip sandwich.  The small coverslip is inverted over the large coverslip using a pair of tweezers (pointed ones are best).  Adherence is ensured by pressing down gently with the tweezers over the beads of grease.  This is a bit tricky to accomplish successfully since the slide is wet.  If it is too wet when the top coverslip is applied, the grease will not adhere.  If too dry, the cells will dry out and will no longer be functional.  In our hands, the bottom coverslip is held vertically and as much liquid as possible is allowed to run off before mounting in the holder.  The bottom coverslip is then allowed to air dry for ~1 min before mounting the top coverslip.  d, Filling the flow chambers and exchanging buffers.  The flow chambers are filled with media (~10 \u00b5L) using a pipet immediately after making the coverslip sandwich.  When the bottom coverslip surface is sufficiently dry, grease barriers (here shown on the bottom) can be constructed on one side of the flow chambers to hold buffer solutions that are then washed into the chambers.  When needed, the solutions are first added (~10 \u00b5L) to the reservoirs chambers, and then strips of filter paper are used to pull the solution out the other side of the flow chamber.  The bottom of the large coverslip should be cleaned before mounting onto the microscope using a Q-tip dipped in water (twice) and then one dipped in 95% ethanol (twice).  It is convenient to do this while the top surface is air-drying.",

The fluorescence emission exiting the right sideport of the microscope enters the adaptive optics setup as diagrammatically illustrated in NCB Figure 1a.  Lens L1 generates an aperture plane on the deformable mirror (DM).  The combination of L2 and L3 generates a conjugate aperture plane at the wavefront sensor (WFS), which is used to tune the mirror deformation via a feedback system to correct the aberrations within the imaging path.  A flip mirror (FM) diverts the beam to the WFS; when the FM is removed, the emission passes into a Optosplit III, which can separate the emission into three separate images on the camera.",
