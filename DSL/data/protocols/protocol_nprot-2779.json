            "content": "Infection by malaria is initiated by the deposition of sporozoites in the skin from the salivary of an infected _Anopheles_ mosquito during its blood meal. These sporozoites then make their way to the liver where they immediately develop in hepatocytes to produce the merozoite forms that invade red blood cells, thus staring the cycle of multiplication that causes disease and allows transmission to mosquitos. In a few of the parasite species that infect primates, the development of some of the hepatic parasites is arrested early after invasion, to resume only months or years later<sup>1-3</sup>. During this time these quiescent parasites are insusceptible to all anti-malarial drugs except for primaquine. The activation of these dormant forms, known as hypnozoites, causes a relapse episode thereby increasing the morbidity of the infection and its potential to transmit. In humans, two species _Plasmodium vivax_ and _Plasmodium ovale_ are capable of forming hypnozoites, and this considerably hampers efforts to control and eventually eliminate them.\r\n\n\n Searching for drugs active against hypnozoites suitable for mass deployment is a urgent requirement because primaquine administration can lead to potentially severe haemolysis in persons with glucose-6-phosphate deficiency, a genetic trait common in populations living the areas endemic for vivax and ovale malaria. At present, screening for hypnozoitocidal activity can only be done one experimentally infected hosts, which must be followed for many months after drug administration. Since the 1950\u2019s, the _P. cynomolgi_-infected rhesus monkey, an excellent model for _P. vivax_, has been used to test for efficacy<sup>4</sup>. Given the costs and ethical limitations inherent to research on primates, screening is restricted to very few compounds indeed. Moreover, there is very little known about the biological processes associated with quiescence and activation of hypnozoites that could help narrow down the molecules to test. Clearly, _in vitro_ cultivation of hypnozoites would make it possible to envisage more efficient and cost-effective screening strategies.\r\n\n\nWe had previously demonstrated that hypnozoite-like forms could be obtained in cultured primary simian hepatocytes infected with _P. cynomolgi_ sporozoites<sup>5</sup>. However confirmation that these were indeed hypnozoites, and optimal use for screening assays, were hampered by the characteristic short durations \\(10-14 days at most) of primary hepatocyte cultures. Here we describe protocols in which the co-culture of simian primary hepatocytes with a HepaRG cell line allows to maintain the cultures for about a month, during which hypnozoites resulting from an initial infection with _P. cynomolgi_ sporozoites can be enriched and observed to activate and develop into mature forms. It is likely that these protocols would also be suitable for the cultivation of _P. vivax_ hypnozoites in human primary hepatocytes."

In this protocol we describe a co-culture system where primary simian hepatocyte could be maintained for a month or more through co-cultivation with an immortalised liver derived cell line, Hepa-RG. The hepatocytes can be infected with _Plasmodium_ sporozoites and the persisting hypnozoites can then observed and investigated",
