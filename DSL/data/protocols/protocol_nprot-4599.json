            "content": "<p>Nucleic acid extraction is the purification of DNA and RNA from biological samples which is an important step for further investigations. Studying on nucleic acid has been started by Johannes Friedrich Miescher in 1869, leading to the discovery of nucleic acid<sup>1</sup>. He tested a variety of experiments, and finally detected a substance with unexpected properties that was called nuclein (today is called DNA). Until now, many protocols have been devised for extracting nucleic acid from diverse samples. Chomczynski and Sacchi (2006) developed an extraction method based on acid guanidinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform which is universally used<sup>2</sup>. A modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) protocol was introduced for DNA isolation<sup>3</sup>. Ghawana et al. (2011) described an RNA isolation system free of guanidinium salt for plant tissues that have high secondary metabolites<sup>4</sup>, and other protocols which are usable for specific samples sources. Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages, and is used for a specific range of tissues and organs. Among this several protocols, the CTAB protocol, which was developed by Murray and Thompson has wide applications<sup>5</sup>. This method is appropriate for the isolation of nucleic acid from plants and is particularly suitable for the elimination of polysaccharide and polyphenolic compounds which reduce the quality of nucleic acids. Now, CTAB as an important plant DNA and RNA isolation system is routinely used for many purposes.</p><p>In this study, a new system is developed to shorten the nucleic acid extraction steps and strengthen their quality. It is applicable to isolate nucleic acid from most plants as well as recalcitrant ones from which the isolation of nucleic acid is difficult. Thus, it provides a high throughput protocol which can be employed for a widespread range of plant tissues. This protocol has been tested on different samples, including apple, pear, potato, thyme, wheat, rice, and many other samples. This method is simple and cost-efficient in comparison to other methods.</p>"

The white pellet will be visible on the bottom of the tubes.\nCRITICAL STEP Do not disturb bottom phases of the solution when you pipet the upper phase.\nPurification of Nucleic Acid (TIMING 5 min)\n9 Discard the supernatant and wash the precipitate nucleic acid gently with 70% EtOH.\n10 After centrifuging at 5400 g at 4\u02daC for 5 min, remove the supernatant and then air-dry the pellet.\nDissolving and Storage Condition (TIMING 5 min)\n11 Dissolve the pellet in 20-30 \u00b5l of RNase free water (commercial) or autoclaved water.\n12 After incubating at room temperature for a few minutes, keep the solubilized nucleic acid in \u221220\u02daC for a short time storage or in \u221280\u02daC for a longtime storage. Figure 1 shows a schematic model of all the DNA and RNA isolation steps of this procedure."

Dual applications of the extraction buffer is resulted in both DNA and RNA (shown in Figure 3). DNA and RNA can be purified by adding RNase and DNase enzymes, respectively, or by adjusting the PH of the extraction buffer. It is considerable that all the buffer components consist certain amount of the chemicals that is one of the big advantages of this protocol. PCR, RT-PCR, real time-PCR and southern blot analysis have been conducted to approve the quality of the extracted DNA and RNA which are acceptable (shown in Figure 4).</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>This protocol describes a rapid DNA and RNA extraction method for plant tissues. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium chloride (NaCl), tris base, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) are the main components of the extraction buffer. In contrast to all previously reported protocols, this extraction method does not require any stock solutions. This isolation buffer is potential of extracting both DNA and RNA simultaneously. Depending on the purpose of the project, the corresponding steps can be slightly altered to obtain either DNA or RNA. The big advantage of this method is to use general laboratory chemicals to make a powerful extraction buffer, resulting in high quality and quantity nucleic acid. Also, CTAB in this buffer is capable of isolating nucleic acid from recalcitrant plants enriched in secondary metabolites. Importantly, this method is recommended for the projects at which isolating nucleic acid in a short time is of crucial importance. This method probably is usable for all plant tissues and takes about an hour.</p>",
