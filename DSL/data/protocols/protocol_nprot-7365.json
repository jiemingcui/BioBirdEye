            "content": "<p>Measurements of auxin metabolites at steady state as well as their metabolic flux can be of great importance to understand hormonal regulation of plant metabolism. The increasing use of LC-HRMS analysis in plant metabolomic analysis made specific and sensitive measurements of several metabolites possible. The HRMS analysis unlike triple quadruple methods required less method development and is more accurate and robust. So far there are several reports on analysis of indole acetate pathway using LC-triple quadruple MS or GC-MS instruments but very few reports on use of LC-HRMS.</p><p>Also, sensitivity of such analysis is hampered by methanol extraction protocols due to high matrix effect from plant tissues. Here, we optimised SPE sample extraction protocol for plant tissues to improve sensitivity and combined with accurate LC-HRMS analysis. The reported method is simple, robust, sensitive and accurate for the determination of auxin metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana shoot tissues.</p>"
