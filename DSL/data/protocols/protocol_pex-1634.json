            "content": "<p>Insurance-based healthcare has been widely implemented worldwide, which urges more preventive intervention to improve patient outcome and reduce healthcare utility. Clinical prediction models are needed to achieve such purpose. Although several machine learning algorithms have been shown satisfying predictive performances for health outcomes,<sup>1-3</sup> these were exposed to optimistic bias due to no independent test set, no data partition, or high dimensionality relatively compared to sample size.<sup>4</sup> Clinical prediction also should be actionable. Identifying causal effects on a predicted health outcome enables targeted interventions to that condition. However, machine learning cannot infer causality yet.</p><p>\tThe best practices established in medicine are developed using hypothetico-deductive reasoning. Any prior knowledge is collected by human learning through literature to generate a hypothesis. Subsequently, statistical methods are used to verify the assumption using available data. In traditional approach, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design have been used to collect data in a causal inference study because of its robustness to remove effects from common causes or confounding factors. However, this is limited due to some considerations (e.g. ethical issues). Even if RCT is possible, a preliminary study of a causal effect using observational data is still warranted to reduce resource waste and potential harm in human research. To conduct such study, a causal diagram is constructed based on prior knowledge as a central assumption.<sup>5</sup> Available data (e.g. electronic health records) may be used to verify this assumption. Solely using statistical analysis on available data without contextual knowledge can introduce data-driven bias.<sup>6</sup> Meanwhile, although human learning can use contextual knowledge to prevent such bias, we still need machines to deal with big data. </p><p>\tTo solve data-driven bias using contextual knowledge, we proposed a learning algorithm for human to systematically construct a causal diagram by literature mining. Then, one of the generalized (G) methods, i.e., inverse probability weighting (IPW), is used to verify each causal factor using available data.<sup>7,8</sup> This method was designed for time-varying exposures which are typically available data from electronic health records.<sup>9,10</sup> Eventually, all causal factors are included in a prediction model to describe the explainability. The use of causal factors in a model is not necessarily be the highly predictive. Better performances of prediction model are normally achieved by exploiting confounding factors.<sup>5</sup> However, by differentiating causal and non-causal predictors, this can warn a human user when conducting a critical appraisal a machine learning model. If a causal effect is large, this also provides a pathway for a preventive intervention. In addition, compared to systematic review and meta-analysis, our learning algorithm is relatively quick and low-intensive labor, which follows human intuition on learning through literatures.</p><p>\tWe applied this protocol to several studies which were parts of a project that applied our human-machine learning algorithm to a variety of predicted outcomes. Human learning by this protocol was one of the comparators beside those applying standard machine learning prediction by PROBAST guidelines.<sup>11</sup> Ethical clearance was waived by the Taipei Medical University Joint Institutional Review Board (TMU-JIRB number: N202106025). This protocol aimed to propose a protocol for feature selection in statistical machine learning by an algorithm for human to systematically construct a causal diagram by literature mining, and to verify the causal assumptions from prior knowledge by statistical modeling, including but not limited to those using real-world, time-varying data from electronic health records.</p>"

            "header": "Procedure",
            "content": "1. Choose one or more literature databases\nA systematic human learning was conducted by literature mining in a particular period. This drew on our assumption of causality. For simplicity and to avoid redundant records, we only used PubMed because it is the most frequently updated (daily), has the longest period coverage (1950 to the present), and is a life science-focused literature database.\n13\nThis database also allows use of specific terms in the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) vocabulary thesaurus from the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA).\n2. Look for a document from an authoritative institution\nWe adopted snowball sampling method by starting with convenience sampling,\n14,15\nwhich was a document from an authoritative institution, to obtain a similar sense with human intuition when learning through the literature. We used the keywords \u2018\"Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture\"[Mesh]\u2019 to find the document for an outcome of prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) in the literature database, as a convenience sampling step. This led to\nPractice Bulletin No. 172\nfrom the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG).\n16\nWe only considered pregnant women as the population of which those studies investigated. The initial document was denoted\nd\n0\n(Algorithm 1).\nAlgorithm 1.\nSnowball sampling modified by starting from convenience sampling to obtain an initial document (\nd\n0\n)\nRequire:\nd\n0\n01:\nA = \u00d8\n02:\nL = \u00d8\n03:\nk\n0\n=\nr\nead(d\n0\n)\n04:\nwhile\nks\n\u2206\nA\n\u2260\n\u00d8\nthen\n05: ........\na\ns\n\u2190 k\ns\n06: ........\nd\ns\n= search(k\ns\n)\n07: ........\nif\nds\n\u2260\n\u00d8\nthen\n08: ................\nk\ns+1\n= read(d\ns\n)\n09: ................\nif\ncausal(k\ns+1\n)\nthen\n10: ........................\npass\n11: ................\nelse\n12: ........................\nl\ns\n\u2190 k\ns+1\n13: ........................\nend while\n14: ........\nelse\n15: ................\nend while\n3. Learn causal factors from the initial document\nWe denoted causal factors of PROM as\nA\n, while the confounders were denoted\nL\n. Confounders are causal factors of a causal factor of PROM. This means\nL\nrepresents the same factors that cause both\nA\nand PROM. Initially, there was no\nA\nor\nL\n. By reading an article/document\nd\n0\n, we identified\na\n\u2208\nA\nto determine\nk\n0\nkeywords that refer to\na\nat the\ns=0\nstage. The next steps were iterative until no\nk\ns\nkeywords referred to any\na\n\u2208\nA\n.\n4. Search for causal factors for each causal factor of the outcome from either the initial document or the subsequent documents\nWe assigned\nk\ns\nto\na\ns\nand searched for the document\nd\ns\nusing\nk\ns\nfor causal factors of\na\ns\n. If a document was found, then we continued; otherwise, the iteration ended. We continued by reading\nd\ns\nto determine\nk\ns+1\nkeywords. This refers to a causal factor of\na\n\u2208\nA\nthat is referred to by the previous\nk\ns\nkeywords.\n5. Identify whether the causal factors from previous step are also causal factors of the outcome\nDocuments were searched and read to check if the\nk\ns+1\nkeyword also refers to causal factors of PROM. If yes, then the\nk\ns+1\nkeyword was passed to the\ns+1\nstage; otherwise, we assigned\nk\ns+1\nto\nl\ns\nand the iteration ended.\n6. Construct a causal diagram for each proposed causal factor of the outcome\nFactors of\nA\nand\nL\nare called first- or second-level factors of PROM, while only first-level ones are causal factors. This determined the position of factors within a circular network depicting a causal diagram which we used for causal inferences. Since first-level factors may come from second-level factors in the process, we could also find inter-causal factor relationships. We included these relationships as edges in the network, because these are needed to construct causal inference formulas. For each causal factor with the common causes that have available data, a node and an edge to this node were drawn from the node of each variable consisting either a causal factor or the common causes. This node represented measured variables. Another node and an edge from this node were drawn to the represented node. This node represented unmeasured variables that can affect measurement error of the measured variables. Please kindly find out more explanation about constructing a causal diagram in this reference.\n5\nThe source codes (vignette) for this step are available in\nhttps://github.com/herdiantrisufriyana/shl\n.\n7. Split a dataset randomly for a discovery and validation set and define variables in the dataset that can represent each causal factor and the common causes\nOnly this set was used for causal inferences. Later, we also used it for training set of a prediction model. We represented demographics and medical histories as candidate causal factors if applicable. These were respectively binarized into 0 and 1 for negative and positive factors. Details of the ICD-10 codes and demographic variables we assigned to each causal factor are available in the source codes. We provided an R package medhist 0.1.0 consisting functions to extract, preprocess, and transform data into each causal factor from a nationwide health insurance claim data.\n8. Define causal inference formula for each proposed causal factor of the outcome based on the causal diagram and available data\nOnly first-level factors were included in the formulas. For example, both asthma and influenza are first-level factors of PROM, while varicella is a second-level factor of PROM via asthma. To determine the formula for the causal inference of asthma, we included only asthma and influenza. We used only asthma\u2019s significance to determine if asthma was a causal factor of PROM. Only the causal factor of interest and confounding factors or common causes were included in the causal formula. We avoided including common effects to prevent collider-stratification bias, or unnecessary inclusion of second-level factors.\n5\n9. Conduct causal inference modeling by a generalized (G) method\nTo verify our assumptions of PROM causality, we applied one of the generalized (G) methods, i.e., IPW, for each causal factor.\n7,8\nThis method was designed for time-varying exposures.\n9,10\nHowever, we also conducted outcome regressions for causal inferences, since this is one of the more commonly methods although it does not work in general.\n5,17\nAnother common method is propensity-score matching with various versions, but we did not apply this method for simplicity. While adjusting all confounding factors is difficult, if not impossible, we disclosed open backdoors (confounding factors that were not blocked) because of limitations of providing data for each causal factor. This will help in interpreting the results of the study with caution.\n18,19\nAn R package is provided for the causal inference modeling using G-methods, which is gmethods 0.1.0.\n10. Develop and validate a prediction model to describe the explainability\nAfter verifying causal factors, we only included those in a prediction model that applied a logistic regression with a shrinkage method, as recommended by PROBAST, instead of using a stepwise selection method.\n11\nWe chose an RR, which applies L\n2\n-norm or beta regularization, because this method retains all causal factors within the model after weights are updated by training.\n20\nThe model was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristics to find the predictive performance using all confirmed causal factors."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>We proposed a learning algorithm for human to conduct literature and data mining for causal factor discovery.&nbsp;The applicability is to select features for a machine learning prediction model, including but not limited to that using real-world, time-varying data from electronic health records. This protocol is relatively quick to find potentially actionable predictors for a clinical prediction while dealing with high dimensionality in big data. However, this protocol might not find a potentially novel cause, since this only exhaustively examines the existing evidences in a single study. The key stages consisted of systematic human learning, causal diagram construction, data preprocessing, causal inference modeling, and development and validation of a prediction model to describe the explainability.</p>",
