            "content": "Earlier, we have reduced the ELISA procedure time by doing it on a photoactivated polystyrene microtiter plate \\(1). Just by activating the plate around 1.5\u20132 fold higher reading was obtained than the untreated  plate  when the assay was carried out at 37 degree celsius in around 8 h  \\(2). Performing ELISA in the wells of a photoactivated polystyrene microtiter plate and  applying different unconventional incubation procedures we have further shortend ELISA timing with the retention of sensitivity and specificity \\(3-5). Thus, ELISA steps at elevated temperature \\(Heat- mediated ELISA or HELISA) were completed in less than 3 h \\(3) where as  ELISA steps by pressure incubation \\(pressure-mediated ELISA or PELISA) was done in 60 minutes only \\(4).   In another breakthrough invention, ultrasound incubation \\(soundwave -mediated ELISA or SELISA) has dramatically reduced the total time required for ELISA to 40 minutes \\(5).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn the present innovative approach we have carried out ELISA without using spectrophotometer or polystyrene microtiter plate \\(6). The promising features of this assay are: \\(i) it is image-based; hence no need of spectrophotometer, \\(ii) miniaturized; hence requires less amount of reagents and analyte, \\(iii) rapid \\(iv) sensitive and \\(v) specific."

The sheet was cut into a strip having dimension of 9 cm in length and 3 cm in width. On the strip, array of test zones \\(small cavities) were made by mildly hammering or pressing with a blunt end metal rod. Each cavity was separated by 0.5 cm. Cavity of the PP\u00b5TP had an average diameter of 3.5 mm and a depth of around 1 mm. All the dimensions were measured by an electronic caliper. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Activation of PP\u00b5TP \r\n  \r\n\n\nThe wells of a PP\u00b5TP were activated by pouring FNAB \\(0.0625 mg/2.5\u00b5l of methanol/cavity)  solution to each well followed by slow evaporation of the solvent. The dry coated plate was activated by UV light for 20  min at a wavelength of 365 nm as described \\(1).    \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL   Fast evaporation may remove  FNAB from the bottom of the cavity to the top. In such case activation may not occur at the bottom.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Detection of analyte\r\n  Analyte \\( human IgG, human IgE) was detected by immobilizing a capture molecule \\(anti-human IgG, anti-human IgE,) onto the activated and untreated cavities of PP\u00b5TP, blocking, binding  of analyte  and binding  of secondary antibody-conjugate by ultrasound waves in a sonicator bath operating at a frequency of 40 KHz and  an output power of 120 W. The plates were washed after each step. Color development was carried out by adding 8\u00b5l of substrate- dye buffer and then stopped by adding 2\u00b5l of 5% sulphuric acid. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. Image- based quantification\r\n  The PP\u00b5TP was then scanned on a desktop scanner \\(HP photo smart C6388) by placing the plate upside down to get the image. From Adobe Photoshop the mean value of each R, G and B of the scanned image was obtained which was then converted to HSB \\(Hue, Saturation, and Brightness) using freely available \u2018Macbeth color calculator\u2019 software. Image was then quantified as color saturation percentage."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "In this protocol, we report spectrophotometer-free image-based miniaturized ELISA on an activated polypropylene microtest plate \\(APP\u00b5TP) which is precise, reliable, rapid, and sensitive. Activated test zone in APP\u00b5TP binds a capture biomolecule through covalent linkage thereby, eliminating non-speci\ufb01c binding often prevalent in absorption based techniques. Efficacy of APP\u00b5TP is demonstrated by detecting human immunoglobulin G \\(IgG), human immunoglobulin E \\(IgE) and Aspergillus fumigatus antibody in patient's sera. Detection is done by taking the image of the assay solution by a desktop scanner and analyzing the color of the image. Human IgE quanti\ufb01cation by color saturation in the image-based assay shows excellent correlation with absorbance-based assay. APP\u00b5TP can quantify an analyte as precisely as in microtiter plate and could be a good substitute for conventional immunoassay procedure widely used in clinical and research laboratories.",
