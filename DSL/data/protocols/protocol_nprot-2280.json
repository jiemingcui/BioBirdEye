            "content": "This protocol describes two imaging methods for Western blot detection of IR fluorescently labelled proteins using the CCD based G:BOX IR<sup>6</sup> Imaging System and laser scanning Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. This protocol was used to detect expression of Actin and ERK proteins derived from HeLa cells. Using fluorescence-based fluorophores has several advantages over the more widely used chemiluminescent detection methods: \\(i) it increases sample throughput as the multiple-colour detection makes it possible to simultaneously detect two or three different proteins using different secondary antibodies \\(see Figure 1), \\(ii)multiplexing several fluorophores simultaneously can be less time consuming, \\(iii) near-infrared \\(NIR) fluorescent dyes \\(spectral region 650-900nm) can significantly reduce background auto-fluorescence providing enhanced detection sensitivity and quantification of proteins, \\(iv) many IR fluorescent dyes are stable and the membranes can be stored before scanning or imaging,  \\(iv) some IR fluorescent dyes are competitively priced and permit the use of lower conjugate concentrations and \\(vi) the CCD and laser-based imaging systems uses electronic data files which allows band intensity  to be varied."

Dilute HeLa cell lysate \\(2.92mg/ml) to a concentration ranging from 29.2 -0.028\u00b5g total protein in 1X LDS sample buffer + 1X sample reducing agent  and load 10\u00b5l on to a NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4-12% Bis-Tris pre-cast SDS-PAGE gel. \r\n  2.  Load Precision All Blue marker \\(2\u00b5l) \\(BioRad) on to the gel. The blue protein marker bands autofluoresce in the 700nm channel and can therefore be visualised by the G:BOX IR\n6\nImaging System and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System.\r\n  3.  Using the XCell Sure-Lock Mini-Cell, run the gel for 30 minutes at 60V and then increase the voltage to 120V until the dye front reaches the bottom \\(~1 hour 30 minutes). \r\n  4.  Prepare the nitrocellulose membrane by wetting in 1X NuPAGE transfer buffer + 10% methanol.\r\n  5.  Prepare the transfer stack for the XCell II Blot Module according to manufacturers instructions and transfer proteins for 1 hour 15 minutes at 30V in 1X NuPAGE transfer buffer + 10% methanol. \r\n  6.  Remove nitrocellulose membrane from the transfer stack and rinse in PBST.\r\n  7.  Block the membrane with Odyssey Blocking Buffer for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle agitation. \r\n  8.  Incubate the membrane overnight at 4\no\nC on a rocker with primary antibodies diluted in Odyssey Blocking Buffer + 0.1% Tween \\(mouse monoclonal anti-actin, 1:5000 and rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK, 1:1000). \r\n  9. Wash the membrane 4 times with PBST, 5 minutes each wash. \r\n  10. Incubate the membrane with secondary antibodies diluted in Odyssey Blocking Buffer + 0.1% Tween for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark with gentle agitation.\r\n  11.  Wash the membrane 3 times with PBST, 5 minutes each wash.\r\n  12.  Finally, rinse the membrane with PBS alone before scanning or using the imaging system. \r\n  \r\n\n\nVisualisation\r\n\n\n1.  G:BOX IR\n6\nsystem settings for DyLight 680 are an Epi Red lighting and a Syngene 705M filter and for DyLight 800 are Epi LED IR740 lighting and a Syngene LY800 filter, 4x4 binning factor for both dyes.\r\n  2.  Odyssey system settings are preset: membrane, resolution: 169 mm, quality: medium, focus offset: 0.0, intensity 4.5 for DyLight 680 and intensity 5 for DyLight 800.\r\n  3.  DyLight 680 is detected as red bands and DyLight 800 is detected as green bands 800nm window. The G:BOX IR\n6\nand Odyssey imaging system can successfully multiplex between the DyLight 680 and DyLight 800 using the stated imaging conditions. The results from both systems show comparable sensitivity \\(Figure 1).\r\n  \r\n\n\nDetermining linear range and limit of detection \\(LOD)\r\n\n\n1. To determine the linear range and LOD of each of the DyLight dyes, plot the amount of actin and ERK proteins loaded onto the gel against the Integrated Intensity \\(K counts mm\n2\n) for the Odyssey system using Odyssey software \\(Figure 2a and 3a), and against raw volume \\(Signal Intensity) for G:BOX IR\n6\nusing the GeneTools software \\(Figure 2b and Figure 3b).\r\n  2. Using the Odyssey and G:BOX IR\n6\nsystems the DyLight 680 was linear over the following range \\(7.3-0.22\u00b5g) series dilution used in this experiment \\(Figure 2a and 2b). \r\n  3. The DyLight 800 was linear with Odyssey and G:BOX IR\n6\nsystems over the dilution series used in this experiment. To compare the linearity of the data and to determine LOD ERK p44 \\(DyLight 800) was used. \r\n  4. The Odyssey system produces a linear range for ERK p44 with R\n2\nvalue of 0.98 and has a LOD of 0.11\u00b5g \\(Figure 3).The G:BOX IR\n6\nsystem produces a linear range for ERK p44 with R\n2\nvalue of 0.98. The LOD with the G:BOX IR\n6\nsystem is 0.11\u00b5g \\(Figure 3)."
