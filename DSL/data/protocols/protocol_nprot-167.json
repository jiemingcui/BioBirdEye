            "content": "1. Digest 2 \u03bcg of vector with restriction enzymes. Gel purify the vector and isolate the DNA using QIAEX II gel extraction kit. Quantitate the vector.\r\n  2. Amplify inserts using Taq DNA polymerase. Set up a 100 \u03bcl PCR reaction with 250 \u03bcM of each dNTP, 0.5 \u03bcM of each primer, and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase \\(from Eppendorf). Cycle as follows: 94\u00b0C for 45 seconds; 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 seconds, 54\u00b0C for 45 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute; 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Add 20 U of DpnI to 100 \u03bcl of PCR products after PCR, incubate at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour \\(not necessary if going from a MAGIC vector to ColE1 origin). Purify the PCR products by QIAquick PCR purification column. Quantitate the inserts. We typically have 20 bp homology between the vector and the inserts.\r\n  3. Take 1 \u03bcg of the vector and 1 \u03bcg of the inserts and treat separately with 0.5 U of T4 DNA polymerase in T4 buffer \\(NEB) plus BSA in a 20 \u03bcl reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes. Stop the reaction by adding 1/10 volume of 10 mM dCTP and leave on ice.\r\n  4. Set up a 10 \u03bcl annealing reaction using 1:1 insert to vector ratio with 150 ng of a 3.1 kb vector \\(0.074 pmol), 1x ligation buffer \\(NEB), appropriate amount of insert, and water. Incubate in 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Leave on ice or store in -20\u00b0C.\r\n  5. Add 5 \u03bcl of the annealed mixture into 150 \u03bcl of BW23474 chemical competent cells, incubate on ice for 30 minutes, heat shock at 42\u00b0C for 45 seconds, return to ice for 2 minutes, add 0.9 ml of SOC, and recover at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour.\r\n  6. Plate 100 \u03bcl onto Cl-Phe/Kan 50 \u03bcg/ml plate; incubate in 37\u00b0C for overnight. \\(Cl-Phe is used for vectors that have PheS-G294 between restriction enzyme sites. We have found that most background comes from uncut vector in our preps and therefore we can select against it with Cl-Phe. However, Cl-Phe is not an essential step and usually only has a 2-fold effect on background.)\r\n  For Cl-Phe/antibiotic plates: 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, 0.4% glycerol, 15 mM DL-p-chlorophenylalanine \\(Sigma C6506), 2% agar. DL-p-chlorophenylalanine will not dissolve until after autoclaving. Glycerol and antibiotics are added after autoclaving. \\(We use a higher Cl-Phe concentration for this vector than in normal MAGIC recipients because the PheS gene in pMAGIC is expressed at a much lower level than in normal MAGIC recipients and therefore requires a higher Cl-Phe concentration.) \r\n\n\nFor SOC: 2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.05% NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM glucose."
