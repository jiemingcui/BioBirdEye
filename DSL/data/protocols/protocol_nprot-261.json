            "content": "Methods to investigate protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells are limited by the use of single reporter functions<sup>1-5</sup>. Such assays are susceptible to numerous intrinsic variables in the level of transfection efficiency, transcription and translation. We have developed assay systems based on enzymatic and fluorescence activities that determine the efficiency of protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells and overcome the potential confounders of single reporter methods<sup>6</sup>. The approach utilizes two gene expression units linked to reporter functions interposed by a deactivation-activation unit such that the downstream unit is switched off. In the event of an interaction the downstream unit is switched on leading to two reporter functions, whilst the upstream reporter is expressed regardless of protein-protein interactions. Thus, the ratio of two reporter activities provides a reference standard to determine the efficiency of protein-protein interactions. The enzymatic assay provides a quantitative analysis, whilst the dual-fluorescence assay is rapid. The dual-fluorescence assay is directly measured on intact cell and does not require cell wall disruption or addition of a substrate and the sensitivity is comparable to that with gal-luc assay and therefore is suitable for high-throughput screening of cDNA, small molecules and peptides that might affect a specific protein-protein interaction."

            "content": "**Plasmid construction**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. For reporter construct preparation, clone the deactivation/activation unit \\(D/A unit) of interest containing polyadenylation signal, DNA binding site, TATA box, splicing unit beginning and ending with exons and 5\u2019 untranslated region \\(UTR) into the Sal I and Bam HI sites of pBPLUGA \\(7). For constructing fluorescence reporter, clone the D/A unit into the multiple cloning site of DsRedExpress-GFP vector \\(Siskoglu and Nasim, unpublished data). Generate a negative control construct by deleting polyadenylation site, the splicing unit and the 5\u2019 UTR, which will lead to the generation of upstream reporter only. This will also help to identify any potential internal initiation site located upstream of the downstream reporter. For bait and prey construct, clone your gene of interest into the multiple cloning site of the vector pTN111 and pTN112. \r\n  \r\n\n\nAs mentioned before, the underlying principle can be used to provide a dual-reporter equivalent of single reporter assays such as MAPPIT. The construct rPAP1-luci can easily be upgraded by inserting the upstream expression unit \\(Reporter A, Figure 1) ending with poly A signal at the 5\u2019 end of rPAP1 promoter.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Prepare plasmid DNA suitable for transfection.\r\n  TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Seeding cells**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3.  Seed 2X 10\n5\nto 4X 10\n5\nHEK293 cells into each well of a 12 well plate. Prepare plates in duplicate \\(one for fluorescence microscopy and one for preparing cell extract)\r\n  4. Grow the cells overnight in a humidified atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C and 5-10% CO\n2\n.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Transfection**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5. Remove the plate from the incubator and examine it briefly under a microscope to ensure that the cells are in a good condition for transfection. \r\n  6. Add 30-50 ng of reporter plasmids \\(pTN114 and pTN124), 80-100 ng of bait and prey plasmids derived from pTN111 and pTN112 into a 0.5ml sterile tube. Prepare samples in duplicate.\r\n  7.  For controls, prepare tubes as follows:\r\n  Negative Control- no plasmid DNA,\r\n\n\nReporter control- reporter plasmid only \\(pTN114 or pTN124),\r\n\n\nBait control- reporter and bait plasmids, and\r\n\n\nPrey control- reporter and prey plasmids.\r\n\n\n8. Prepare a transfection mixture by mixing 25 \u00b5l of serum free medium and 2.5 \u00b5l Gene Jammer transfection reagent and in a sterile tube. Mix the reagent and medium either by pipetting or inverting the tube four to five times. For multiple transfections, prepare an appropriate amount of transfection mixture. For example, for nine transfection reactions, prepare enough mixture for 10 reactions \\(25 \u00b5l of Gene Jammer Transfection Reagent and 250 \u00b5l of medium) to compensate for loss due to pipetting errors. This saves time and will ensure an equimolar ratio of DNA and transfection mixture in each reaction. \r\n  9. Incubate the mixture for 5-10 minutes at room temperature.\r\n  10. Discard the medium using an aspirator and examine under a microscope to ensure that the cells are not aspirated. \r\n  11. Add 500 \u00b5l of pre-warmed complete medium. Pre-warm the medium by placing in a 37\uf0b0C waterbath for 10-15 minutes. \r\n  12. After incubation, add drop-wise the mixture onto each well and incubate for 3 hours in the incubator.\r\n  13. After 3 hours, add an additional 500 \u00b5l of pre-warmed medium into each well and incubate for 48 hours in the incubator.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Fluorescence microscopy**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n14. Forty eight hours after transfection, remove the plate from the incubator and examine the expression of green and red fluorescence proteins under a fluorescence microscope. The images can be analysed using Openlab software \\(Improvision). Cells expressing both green and red fluorescence can be selected using a flow cytometer \\(Becton Dickinson) and the fluorescence intensities can be determined using Cellquest software. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Cell harvest**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n15. Forty eight hours after transfection, discard medium from each well and add 200 \u00b5l TEN7.5 into each well.\r\n  16. Incubate the plate for 5-10 minutes at room temperature.\r\n  17. To dissociate cells from the well, gently pipette the solution up and down for 5-6 times and transfer them into a new tube. \r\n  18.  Spin down the cells at 1000 g in a bench-top cold centrifuge and discard medium.\r\n  \r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT\r\n\n\n Cell pellet can be stored at -80 \u00b0C for 1-2 months.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Cell extract preparation**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n19. Add 100 \u00b5l 1 X Reporter Lysis Buffer into each tube.\r\n  20. Vortex the tube for 10 seconds or until a homogenous mixture is appeared.\r\n  21. Freeze the cells onto dry ice for 3-5 minutes and thaw them by incubating in a 37 \u00b0C waterbath for 2 minutes.\r\n  TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n\n\n22. Repeat the freeze and thaw procedure in step 21 one to two times. \r\n  23. Spin down the cells at 10000 g in a cold centrifuge and transfer supernatant into a pre-cooled 0.5 ml tube. Store the tubes on ice. Sufficient extract should be prepared to determine the enzymatic activities and verified the reporter by western blot analysis.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Determination of the efficiency of protein-protein interactions by luciferase and beta-galactosidase activity**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n24. Add 12.5 \u00b5l of Buffer A \\(Applied Biosystems) into a luminometer tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n25.  Add 2- 10 \u00b5l of cell extracts and add 50 \u00b5l of Buffer B containing Galacton Plus \\(Applied Biosystems) and measure the luciferase activity.\r\n   \r\n\n\n26.  Incubate the sample for 30 minutes at room temperature, add 50 \u00b5l of Accelerator\u2013II \\(Applied Biosystems) and measure the beta-galactosidase activity. \r\n  27.  Determine the activities in duplicate if using a tube lumionometer \\(e.g. SIRIUS) and in triplicate if using a plate luminometer \\(ORION II plate luminometer). \r\n  28. Determine the ratio of luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase activities. For statistical analysis, prepare data derived from 3-6 independent experiments.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Verification of the reporter by western blot analysis**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nVerification of the reporter and bait/prey expression is required and hence an instruction for western blotting is mentioned below. Note that if using the antibodies conjugated with HRP \\(e.g. anti-Luc HRP), western blotting can be performed by incubating with the relevant antibody and does not require the addition of secondary antibody. Once verified, western blotting is no longer required routinely.\r\n\n\n29. Separate 20 \u00b5l of cell extracts and a pre-stained marker by SDS PAGE gel and transfer the proteins onto nitrocellulose membrane.\r\n  30.  Block the membrane with 5% milk for one hour at room temperature.\r\n  31. Wash the membrane with TBS \\(50 mM Tris.Cl, pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 minutes at room temperature on a rocking shaker.\r\n  32. Incubate the membrane with primary antibody \\(e.g. anti-GFP antibody) at 4 \u00b0C for overnight.\r\n  33. Wash the membrane with TBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20 three to five times on a rocking shaker as described in step 31. \r\n  34. Incubate the membrane with secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour and wash the membrane as mentioned in step 33. \r\n  35. Develop the membrane using ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents."

As expected, overexpression of dual-fluorescence reporter \\(pTN124) alone and together with bait or prey plasmids generate DsRed-Express protein \\(Figure 2i-iii). The expression of GFP is activated by the overexpression of bait and prey plasmids encoding p53 and LgT proteins \\(Figure 2iv-v). Similarly, overexpression of enzymatic reporter \\(pTN114) generates beta-galactosidase activity and in the event of protein-protein interactions produces luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities \\(Figure 3). The ratio of reporter activities \\(luciferase vs beta-galactosidase and DsRed-Express vs GFP) can be used as a reference standard to detect changes in the cis-acting elements or trans-acting factors that might affect the specific protein-protein interaction."
