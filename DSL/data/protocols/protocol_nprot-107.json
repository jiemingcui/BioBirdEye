            "content": "DNA damage accumulation and consequent DNA damage response activation may be the result of a variety of DNA insults and may contribute to the phenotypes associated with aging and cancer initiation. One of the most robust markers of the generation of a DNA double strand break and DNA damage response activation is the phosphorylation of the histone H2AX on serine 139. The modified form \\(also known as &#x3B3;H2AX) labels the sites of DNA damage by spreading for megabases of chromatinised DNA. Its detection is therefore a reliable readout of the cellular events associated with DNA damage generation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe describe here a detailed protocol for the reliable detection of &#x3B3;H2AX in mammalian \\(mouse or human) formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues."

A positive control is the tissue in which the molecule of interest is known to be expressed and in the specific case a X-rays irradiated tissue.  On the other side, the simplest negative control is the absence of expression in tissues in which the molecule of interest is known not to be expressed. A better negative control is the elimination of the signal by pre-incubating the antibody with an excess of the peptide or protein with which it was raised, or by replacing the primary antibody with buffer in Ab mix. Each single experiment should run positive as well as negative controls simultaneously with the testing samples. \r\n\n\nAntigen unmasking can be optimized for different antibodies.\r\n\n\nDAB solution must be prepared just before the use according to manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol."

            "content": "When tissue staining has not given the expected results, several experimental variables should be considered:\r\n\n\nNO STAINING\r\n\n\n1) Confirm that no reagents were omitted and that were added in the correct order and for sufficient incubation times.\r\n\n\n2) Check antibody titrations and dilutions. This is particularly important for the primary antibody. \r\n\n\n3) Check reagent expiration dates and storage. \r\n\n\n4) Check specimen storage. \r\n\n\n5) Check that the microscope is adjusted correctly.\r\n\n\n6) Do not let the slides air dry in any step of the procedure\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBACKGROUND\r\n\n\n1. The pre-incubation time can be increased in order to reduce the background\r\n  2. Re-titer antibodies \\(both primary and secondary) with a dilution series.\r\n  3. Incubate with chromogen for a shorter time. Some chromogens, such as DAB, develop very quickly.\r\n  4.  Enzyme or biotin in the tissue is reacting with the reagent. This can be prevented by increasing the time or concentration of blocking, trying different types of blocking, or using a combination of more than one blocking, or changing the staining methods. \r\n  5. The incorrect blocking serum was used, or blocking serum was not used. The blocking serum should be from the species of the secondary antibody. \r\n  6. The secondary antibody cross-reacts with endogenous tissue proteins.\r\n  7. The embedding media may not be completely removed from the tissue. Review the removal procedure for possible changes."
