            "content": "The Cre/loxP system is a powerful genome engineering tool that has been extensively used in numerous areas of the life sciences. Cre recombinase catalyzes recombination between two of its consensus DNA sequences, named _loxP_<sup>1\u20133</sup>, and can be used for various applications including lineage/cell type-specific gene knockout, selectable marker removal, and chromosomal rearrangement<sup>1\u20138</sup>. Although the Cre/loxP system has been widely used in a variety of organisms including plant cells<sup>9\u201317</sup>, its application in cultured plant cells has been limited compared to that in animal cells. One major obstacle is cell wall, which protects plant cells from mechanical stress and the entry of exogenous substances. Methods have been developed to deliver biomaterials into cultured plant cells through the cell wall, such as the delivery of DNA using a particle gun or _Agrobacterium_ \\(_Rhizobium_)-mediated techniques are widely used in plant research<sup>18,19</sup>. However, exogenous DNA fragments are often or invariably incorporated into the genomic DNA and may induce unexpected effects that interfere with subsequent analyses. To overcome these obstacles, we focus on direct protein delivery to cultured plant cells and show an efficient protein-electroporation technique for Cre recombinase into cultured _Arabidopsis thaliana_ cells with an intact cell wall."

Incubate the competent cell/DNA mixture on ice for 5 min.\r\n\n\n2) Heat-shock the mixture by incubation at 42\u00b0C for 30 sec. Put the tube back on ice for 2 min. \r\n\n\n3) Add 100 \u03bcL of SOC media to the mixture and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 30-60 min.\r\n\n\n4) For the pre-culture, put the 100 \u00b5l of the mixture into 15 mL of LB with kanamycin. Incubate the LB with shaking at 37\u00b0C overnight. Rest of the transformation mixture can be plated on LB ager plate containing kanamycin in case of backup. Cre protein is less toxic to _E. Coli_, so that the supplementation of glucose, a catabolic repressor for leaky expression, to the preculture is not necessary.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 2\r\n\n\n1) Pour the 15 mL of pre-culture to 1 L of LB with kanamycin in a baffled flask.\r\n\n\n2) Incubate at 37\u00b0C with shaking for 2-3 h, until absorbance A\n600\nbecomes 0.6.\r\n\n\n3) Shift the temperature to 18\u00b0C and incubate with shaking for 30 min.\r\n\n\n4) Add 1 mL of 0.1 M IPTG \\(0.1 mM of final concentration) to induce protein expression and incubate at 18\u00b0C with shaking overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 3\r\n\n\n1) Collect cells by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant.\r\n\n\n2) Resuspend cells in 40 mL of ice-cold Lysis10 buffer.\r\n\n\n3) Add 800 \u03bcl of 10% Triton X-100 towards final concentration of 0.2% Triton X-100.\r\n\n\n4) Sonicate the suspension to shear the DNA for 10 min on ice. We do not add lysozyme or nuclease to the lysate, since these components are difficult to be removed completely from samples.\r\n\n\n5) Centrifuge the suspension at 9,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to pellet the cellular debris.\r\n\n\n6) Transfer the supernatant to a new tube on ice.\r\n\n\n7) Repeat Steps 5 and 6.\r\n\n\n8) Transfer 10 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA Agarose into a clean empty column.\r\n\n\n9) Wash and equilibrate the column by running 20 ml of lysis buffer through the column.\r\n\n\n10) Add the supernatant of Step 7 lysate to the column.\r\n\n\n11) Wash the column with 15 mL of Wash20 buffer.\r\n\n\n12) Repeat Step 11.\r\n\n\n13) Elute the protein with 3 mL of Elute500 buffer.\r\n\n\n14) Repeat Step 13.\r\n\n\n15) Analyze each fraction to determine the purity of Cre protein by SDS-PAGE followed by CBB stain.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 4\r\n\n\n1) Purify the eluted HNCre protein with a gel filtration column and Buffer A using chromatography system and HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR Gel filtration column.\r\n\n\n2) Freeze the purified HNCre protein using liquid N\n2\nand store it at -80\u00b0C\r\n\n\n3) Thaw the frozen protein and dialyze it with HBS before use.\r\n\n\nNote: It is important to use buffers containing 500 mM NaCl because Cre protein, especially at lower salt concentration, tends to bind and thus copurified with nucleic acids, and also tends to aggregate during purification process.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Electroporation**\r\n\n\n1) T87 cells are maintained with rotary shaker \\(120 rpm) under constant light at 22\u00b0C. Passage T87 cells into fresh NT1 medium \\(pH 5.8) 1\u20135 days before electroporation. Time for pre-culture does not largely affect the electroporation efficiency. \r\n\n\n2) Collect cells in a fresh 1.5 mL-tube. Cells can be left for 5 min to settle naturally.\r\n\n\n3) Remove the supernatant and visually estimate the packed cell volume \\(pcv). Wash cells once with Opti-MEM I \\(at least 1 volume of pcv).\r\n\n\n4) Discard the supernatant. Add 200 \u00b5L of Opti-MEM I with 1\u20135 \u03bcM HNCre protein to the 20 \u00b5L pcv of cells on ice.\r\n\n\nNote: The delivery efficiency is increased with increasing concentrations of Cre protein.\r\n\n\n5) Transfer cells into a 4-mm-wide cuvette on ice.\r\n\n\nNote: A 4-mm-wide cuvette is recommended because T87 cells often form large aggregates.\r\n\n\n6) Place the cuvette into NEPA21 Type\u2161.\r\n\n\n7) Use the electroporation program; 375 V/cm \\(150 V setting/0.4 cm width), 10 ms, 5 times, and a 50 ms interval for poring pulse, and 20 V, 50 ms, 20 times, and a 50 ms interval for transfer pulse.\r\n\n\nNote: The delivery efficiency is increased with increasing the field strength or/and duration of poring pulse.\r\n\n\n8) Immediately after electroporation, add 800 \u00b5L of NT1 medium \\(pH 5.8) to the cuvette and transfer all cells to a new 1.5 mL-tube.\r\n\n\n9) Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells with 1 mL of NT1 medium \\(pH 5.8). Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells with 2 mL of NT1 medium \\(pH 5.8). Transfer cells to a 12-well plate.\r\n\n\n10) Culture cells at 22\u00b0C with shaking until the assay.\r\n\n\nNote: When T87-xGxGUS cells is used, the delivery efficiency of HNCre protein can be measured by \u00df-glucuronidase \\(GUS) activity using X-Glucuronide or 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl \u03b2-D-glucuronide, or genomic PCR primers flanking the two _loxP_ sites as follows.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**GUS staining**\r\n\n\n1) Two days after electroporation, discard the supernatant and resuspend cells with 0.5 mg/mL of X-Glucuronide dissolved in 300 \u03bcL of staining buffer.\r\n\n\nNote: At least 2 days of incubation after electroporation are necessary for the detection of GUS activity.\r\n\n\n2) Incubate cells for 30 min at 37\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n3) Transfer cells into 70% \\(w/v) ethanol.\r\n\n\n4) Image cells using a phase contrast microscope.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Fluorescence quantification of GUS activity**\r\n\n\n1) Two days after electroporation, wash cells once with NT1 medium \\(pH 7.0).\r\n\n\n2) Suspend cells with 5 \u00b5L of PCV in 100 \u00b5L of NT1 medium \\(pH 7.0).\r\n\n\n3) Transfer cells to a black 96-well plate.\r\n\n\n4) Add 5 \u00b5L of 200 \u00b5M CMUG \\(final concentration of 10 \u00b5M CMUG) to each well.\r\n\n\n4) Measure fluorescence using a microplate reader. The excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength are set at 355 nm and at 460 nm, respectively.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Genomic PCR**\r\n\n\n1) Two days after electroporation, discard the supernatant and resuspend 10 \u00b5L pcv of cells with 10 \u00b5L of 250 mM NaOH and 0.1% Tween20.\r\n\n\n2) Incubate cells for 10 min at 98\u00b0C to extract genomic DNA.\r\n\n\n3) Add 5 \u00b5L of 1M Tris-HCl \\(pH 6.5).\r\n\n\n4) Centrifuge cells at 10,000 g for 5 min at RT.\r\n\n\n5) Collect the supernatant.\r\n\n\n6) Perform genomic PCR using MightyAmp DNA Polymerase Ver.3 and the supernatant as a template DNA with primers TCCTTCGCAAGACCCTTCCTC and GGATGGCAAGAGCCAAATGCTTAG.\r\n\n\n7) Analyze PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis.\r\n\n\n8) Stain gels with GelGreen.\r\n\n\n9) Image gels using a transilluminator."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Cre recombinase is widely used in a variety of organisms to manipulate DNA both in vitro and in vivo. Combined with its consensus DNA sequences, named loxP, it allows the DNA modification including deletions, insertions, translocations and inversions at specific DNA locus of cells. To promote its use in plant cultured cells, we report here a detailed protocol for direct protein delivery of Cre recombinase into cultured Arabidopsis thaliana cells with an intact cell wall. Electroporation with the optimized buffer and program enables the efficient delivery of Cre protein and following recombination in cultured Arabidopsis thaliana cells. Specifically, we describe the purification of Cre protein, the preparation of electroporation samples, and the assessment of electroporated cells. This simple, economical, and effective technology will contribute to the biological analysis of genes and cellular functions in cultured Arabidopsis thaliana cells.
