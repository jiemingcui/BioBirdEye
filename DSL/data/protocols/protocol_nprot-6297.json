            "content": "INTRODUCTION \r\n\n\nWith the thought provoking statement by E. J. Ari\u00ebns \\(ref. 1) in 1984 that the commonly used racemates were drugs with 50% contamination there was triggered a debate among pharmacologists and medicinal chemists, it alerted the drug regulators too. The most infamous example of an enantiomeric drug having unwanted side effects in the background was that of thalidomide \\(ref. 2). The USFDA announced the policy statement in 1992 restricting the marketing of racemic drugs \\(ref. 3). Later in 1996, European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations \\(EFPIA), US FDA, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America \\(PhRMA) and Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association \\(JPMA), under the aegis of International Conference on Harmonization \\(ICH) produced a comprehensive set of guidelines for registration of new chiral pharmaceuticals \\(ref. 4). These guidelines require pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate stereospecific fate of both the enantiomers in the body including the necessary stereoselective analytical methods of chiral drugs before their introduction into the market and during industrial manufacture. Thus, the development of simple methods for enantioseparation and control of enantiomeric purity for chiral drugs acquires a great significance to facilitate an accurate evaluation of the risks posed by them to human health. \r\n\n\nThe establishment of reliable analytical methods for determination of enantiomers has always been increasing in the fields of chromatography, pharmacology, medicine, asymmetric synthesis, mechanistic studies, extra-terrestrial chemistry, life sciences etc. And, still separation of enantiomers and determination of their purity is challenging and important. Both direct and indirect approaches of enantioseparation \\(using LC) have their own advantages and limitations depending upon the source and amount of sample available, chemical structure of the analyte and the ease of availability of laboratory facilities. \r\n\n\nA large number of papers reporting on the development and application of enantiomeric separations via indirect approach reflect the importance of covalent chiral derivatization in the solution of practical problems in pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis. The primary aim of derivatization in enantioseparation is the formation of easy to separate diastereomeric derivatives and at the same time to improve the detectability by introducing chromophoric or fluorophoric groups into enantiomeric molecules. Inspite of availability of different types of detectors \\(particularly, in HPLC) UV remains the method of choice for simplicity and cost considerations. Separation of diastereomeric pair via indirect technique is generally simpler to perform and often has better resolution than that obtained with a direct method because chromatographic conditions are much easily optimized and the chiral derivatizing reagents \\(CDRs) can provide highly sensitive detector response requiring only an achiral column. \r\n\n\nThe indirect approach must fulfil the following requirements, \\(i) the enantiomer molecule and the CDR must possess an easily derivatizable and compatible functional group, \\(ii) the CDRs and the diastereomers should be stable, \\(iii) the enantiomeric purity of the chiral reagent must be very high or its purity should be known, \\(iv) the derivatization reaction should be fast and complete, and, if not so, the reaction rates of two enantiomers must be kinetically equal, and, \\(iv) the reaction conditions must be moderate to avoid any racemization of the analyte during the reaction \\(ref. 5). \r\n\n\nSeparation via diastereomer formation is usually improved when bulky groups are attached to the stereogenic centre and when the stereogenic centres of both the reagent and the analyte are in close proximity in the resulting diastereomer. Introduction of a chromophore enhances detection \\(say, for HPLC separation). Performance of HPLC enantioseparation would thus depend upon the chemical nature of the CDR acting as the reagent tagged to enantiomers, selection of organic modifiers for their polarity, and the adjustment of buffer pH, and concentration.\r\n\n\nWith the above mentioned background, several CDRs have been synthesised and used for enantioseparation of a variety of pharmaceuticals, marketed as racemic mixtures, at this laboratory \\(refs. 5-13).These included CDRs having cyanuric chloride or DFDNB or \\(S)-Naproxen \\(Npx) as the chromophoric moiety and were suitable for enantioseparation of pharmaceutically important compounds containing amino group. There have appeared a few review articles on use of CDRs based on DFDNB for HPLC enantioresolution of DL-amino acids, particularly \\(refs. 14-16). \r\n\n\nThe diastereomers prepared with DFDNB based CDRs had a very similar absorption spectrum characterized by a \u03bb-max at 340 nm but there remains a drawback for DFDNB based derivatives that a gradual change occurs as a result of a photochemical decomposition of the absorbing chromophore, if the solutions are not kept in dark. Unstable derivatives, poor detection of certain derivatives, or lack of quantitative yield of the reaction were the inherent limitations in using other CDRs. The CDRs developed from \\(S)-Npx had either amide bond or ester linkage or anhydride. In our laboratory, benzotriazole activated naproxen \\(Nap-Btz) was synhesized by an improved, simple and safe method under mild conditions of stirring at room temperature for 2.5 h using DCC/DMAP coupling reagent \\(ref. 17) in contrast to its synthesis in 4 hr using hazardous thionyl chloride by Katritzky et al. \\(ref. 18).\r\n\n\nSuccess of enantioseparation of several racemic pharmaceuticals using \\(S)-Npx based CDRs led us to choose \\(S)-levofloxacin \\(Lfx; Fig.1), as the chiral moiety, to synthesise CDRs, for its high molar absorptivity \\(\u0190o ~24000 mol-1 cm-1) owing to substituted aromatic residue and the carboxylic group and its availability in low price as pure \\(S)-enantiomer.\r\n\n\nThis protocol reports validated enantioseparation of \\(RS)-Metoprolol \\(Mel, selected as the analyte from among the common \u03b2-blockers marketed as a racemate) by HPLC using CDRs based on \\(S)-levofloxacin, synthesized for this purpose. Here we have also shown that the protocol is successfully applicable to enantioseparation of \\(RS)-atenolol. The methodology could be applied to many other racemic pharmaceuticals containing an amino functional group."

            "content": "Experimental Approach\r\n\n\nThe carboxylic group of \\(S)-Lfx was activated by reaction with N-hydroxybenzotriazole because esters of 1-hydroxy benzotriazole are extremely potent acylating agents19 while N-hydroxysuccinimide esters are highly reactive and yield the desired amide bond \\(between amino group of \\(RS)-Mel and the carbonyl of \\(S)-Lfx) with expected ease \\(ref. 20). The exceptional reactivity of the two esters is due to the effect of neighbouring N-atom \\(providing anchimeric assistance). Besides being very good nucleophiles, the benzotriazole and succinimidyl moieties serve as very good leaving groups when substituted with amino group containing \\(RS)-Mel leading to easy formation of diastereomers. Diastereomers were synthesized under mild derivatization conditions with shorter reaction time. Reaction conditions for synthesis of CDRs and diastereomers were optimized. \r\n\n\nThe nucleophilic substitution of the hydroxybenzotriazole or the hydroxysuccinimidyl moiety by the attack of the amino group of the analyte leads to the formation of diastereomeric pair containing amide bond \\(which is a rigid structure). The structures of diastereomers drawn on the basis of chemical reaction between \\(RS)-Mel and the CDR having chiral auxiliary with \\(S)-configuration are shown in Fig.2; these are designated as \\(S,S)-, and \\(S,R)-diastereomers, respectively, where the first letter \\(S) corresponds to the configuration of chiral auxiliary and the other \\(S)/\\(R) corresponds to that of \\(S)-Mel or \\(R)-Mel. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAnalysis\r\n\n\nThe CDRs and diastereomers were characterized by using spectroscopic technique like 1H-NMR, UV-visible, IR, elemental analysis and HRMS. The chiral purity of CDRs was established as per methods reported earlier from this laboratory21-23. The diastereomers were separated by achiral RP-HPLC as well as by open column chromatography \\(for preparative separation in good yield). Separation of diastereomers by RPHPLC was successful using Acetonitrile-TEAP \\(60:40, v/v) as the mobile phase and CH3OH-CH2Cl2 \\(9:1, v/v) was successful for preparative separation by open column chromatography. The mobile phase ratios were systematically optimized. Because of the structural features of the CDRs \\(e.g., based on \\(S)-Lfx, in the present case), the diastereomers contain increased number of aromatic residues and polar groups which influence interaction with C18 stationary phase during elution and also show enhanced absorption in UV-visible detector. Sections of chromatograms showing separation of diastereomers of \\(RS)-Mel prepared with CDR-1 and CDR-2 are shown in Fig. 3.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStructures of diastereomers\r\n\n\n1H NMR spectra of the purified diastereomers \\(separated through open column chromatography) show chemical shift values for the peaks of \u2013OH signal in the two diastereomers at \u03b4 2.05 and \u03b4 2.27. The difference in chemical shift \\(i.e., \u0394\u03b4RS value of -0.22) is large enough for a diagnostic \u2013OH signal which can be represented as, \\[\u0394\u03b4RS\\(OH) = \u03b4S\\(OH)\u2013\u03b4R\\(OH)], where \\(R) and \\(S) descriptors refer to the stereogenic configuration in the Mel moiety. The \u03b4 values \\(in ppm) of \u2013OH proton and the 1H NMR signals corresponding to the asymmetric center in Mel in the \\(S,S)-, and \\(S,R)-diastereomers are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.\r\n\n\nFurther, the lowest energy optimized structures of the diastereomers were developed, using the Gaussian 09 Rev. A.02 program and hybrid density functional B3LYP with 6-31G* basis set \\(based on density functional theory), and are shown in Fig.4. The structures clearly show formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of \\(S)-Lfx molecule and hydroxyl group of Mel in one of the diastereomers while formation of such an intramolecular hydrogen bond was not possible in the other diastereomer. The formation of H-bonding in one of the diastereomers is considered to be responsible for difference in the chemical shift of the \u2013OH signal in the 1H NMR spectra \\(Supplementary Fig. 1). The formation of hydrogen bond causes a downfield shift and a difference in the chemical shift of the \u2013OH protons in the two diastereomers is observed. Thus the formation of hydrogen bond in one of the diastereomers only arises due to specific spatial arrangement.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSeparation mechanism and elution order\r\n\n\nIt can be observed \\(Fig.4) that in \\(S,R)-diastereomer \\(DsA-2) the bulky groups like phenyl \\(of Mel) and piperazinyl \\(of Lfx) are present on the same side of the planar amide bond \\(cis-, type orientation) and this planarity further supports the formation of intramolecular H-bond between the \u2013OH proton \\(in the Mel moiety) and the carbonyl oxygen \\(of the Lfx moiety). On the other hand, in \\(S,S)-diastereomer \\(DsA-1), these groups are spatially oriented on the opposite side \\(i.e., trans geometry) and there is no intramolecular H-bonding. These differences \\(in terms of steric arrangement and the H-bond) cause difference in hydrophobicity which would be expected to result into differential interaction of the diastereomers with the C18 material of the column. The diastereomer with cis orientation is considered to have a stronger interaction with the C18 column material; these stronger or weaker interactions lead to different retention times of the two diastereomers and their separation. Therefore, the \\(S,R)-diastereomer \\(DsA-2) having cis-type orientation would have larger retention time as compared to \\(S,S)-diastereomer \\(DsA-1), having the trans-type arrangement. \r\n\n\nThe three point rule \\(ref. 24) proposed for resolution of enantiomers considers H-bond as one of the important factors along with \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and steric repulsions, between the CSP and one of the enantiomeric forms to distinguish between the two enantiomeric forms. But in the present case, the stationary phase is achiral and the \\(S)-Lfx moiety being chiral is responsible for the formation of diastereomers \\(for example from CDR-1) and the differential interaction of the diastereomers with the ODS causes separation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nProtocol overview\r\n\n\nThe protocol is a successful and simple method for enantioseparation, by derivatization approach, not only on an analytical scale but also on a preparative level. \\(S)-Lfx based CDRs are esters in terms of nature of chemical bonding introduced during their synthesis by activating carboxyl group by its reaction with N-hydroxysuccinimide or N-hydroxybenzotriazole in presence of DCC as the coupling reagent. \r\n\n\nThis protocol is focussed on analytical separation of diastereomers of \\(RS)-Mel by RP HPLC and preparative separation and isolation of diastereomers by open column chromatography. For this purpose, two new CDRs were synthesised using \\(S)-Lfx as the chiral moiety and microwave assisted synthesis of diastereomers of \\(RS)-Mel was carried out. Absolute configuration of the diastereomers was established with the help of 1H NMR \\(supported by developing the lowest energy optimized structures of the diastereomers) to ensure the success of diastereomeric synthesis and to establish the reliability of enantioseparation. It becomes desirable because most of the time diastereomer corresponding to pure enantiomer of the analyte is not available while for the enantioseparation investigation to be reliable and to apply the said separation method conveniently to determine enantiomeric purity of the pharmaceutical sample it is desirable to confirm the absolute configuration of diastereomers so separated at the time of optimizing the separation conditions."

            "content": "ANTICIPATED RESULTS\r\n\n\nThe \\(S)-Lfx moiety in the CDRs adds a highly absorbing chromophore that converts \\(RS)-Mel \\(or other amino group containing racemate) into UV active diastereomers. This allows separation of \\(R)-, and \\(S)-components of the racemate as diastereomers in the nano range on an achiral column with the inherent rapidity of determination in HPLC. The other advantage of the CDRs is the increased but differential hydrophobicity \\(thus increasing \u03b1 and Rs) of the derivatives. The protocol can be successfully applied for determination and control of enantiomeric purity of \\(RS)-Mel routinely in industries and R&D laboratories \\(even without resorting to 1H NMR, and DFT, each time). The method can also be applied for detection of trace amount of amino group containing pharmaceuticals which are marketed and administered as racemic mixture.\r\n\n\nRetention factors \\(k), separation factor \\(\u03b1) and resolution \\(Rs) were calculated and the separation method was validated for linearity, accuracy, limit of detection \\(LOD) and limit of quanti\ufb01cation \\(LOQ); the details are provided in \u2018Supplementary\u2019 information. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOrganic synthesis: The analytical data of organic compounds are given below.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nCDR-1 \\(levofloxacin-N-hydroxysuccinimide).\r\n\n\nBrown solid, m.p. 117\u2013118 oC\r\n\n\nSpecific rotation= -92 \u25cb \\(c =0.3 in MeOH at 25 \u25cbC) \r\n\n\nUV \\(294 nm, \u03bbmax in MeOH)\r\n\n\nIR \\(KBr, cm-1): 3435, 2927, 2361, 1704, 1628, 1576, 1481, 1305, 1245\r\n\n\n1H NMR \\(400MHZ, CDCl3) delta 1.58 \\(d, 3H), 2.29 \\(s, 3H) 2.65 \\(t, 4H), 2.89 \\(s, 3H), 3.36 \\(m, 1H), 3.66 \\(t, 4H), 4.37-4.52 \\(dd, 2H, -O-CH2-), 7.65 \\(d, 1H, Ar-H), 8.62 \\(s, 1H, Ar-H)\r\n\n\nHRMS \\(m/z) 481.2039 \\(\\[M+Na]+, 20%)\r\n\n\nAnalysis \\(calculated, found for C22H23FN4O6), C \\(57.64, 57.58) H \\(5.06, 5.18) N \\(12.22, 12.31)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCDR-2 \\(levofloxacin-N-hydroxybenzotriazole).\r\n\n\nPale yellow solid, m.p. 138-139 \u25cbC\r\n\n\nSpecific rotation = -93 o \\(c =0.3 in MeOH at 25 \u25cbC)\r\n\n\nUV \\(294 nm, \u03bbmax in MeOH)\r\n\n\nIR \\(KBr, cm-1) 3328, 2927, 2851, 1710, 1626, 1574, 1475, 1398, 1245\r\n\n\n1H NMR \\(400MHz, CDCl3) delta- 1.56 \\(d, 3H), 2.29 \\(s, 3H), 2.78 \\(s, 4H), 3.22 \\(m, 1H), 3.54 \\(t, 4H), 4.28-4.40 \\(dd, 2H), 7.31 \\(m, 2H, Ar-H), 7.61 \\(d, 1H, Ar-H), 7.65 \\(d, 1H, Ar-H), 7.78\\(d, 1H, Ar-H), 8.59 \\(s, 1H, Ar-H) \r\n\n\nHRMS \\(m/z) 501.2058 \\(\\[M+Na]+, 25%)\r\n\n\nAnalysis \\(Calculated, found for C24H23FN6O4), C \\(60.25, 60.12) H \\(4.85, 4.74) N \\(17.56, 17.68);\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOpen Column Chromatography:\r\n\n\nFirst eluted diastereomer \\(DsA-1)\r\n\n\nYellow-brown, m.p. 135-138 \u25cbC\r\n\n\nSpecific rotation = -60 o \\(c 0.5 in MeOH at 25 \u25cbC)\r\n\n\nUV \\(294 nm, \u03bbmax in MeOH)\r\n\n\nIR \\(KBr, cm-1): 3300, 2928, 2851, 1709, 1627, 1576, 1444, 1383, 1312, 1244, 1087\r\n\n\n1H NMR \\(400MHz, CDCl3)delta- \\(d, 6H), 1.60 \\(d, 3H), 2.25 \\(s, 1H), 2.35 \\(s, 3H), 2.54 \\(s, 4H), 2.78 \\(t, 2H), 2.94 \\(m, 1H), 3.12 \\(d, 1H), 3.21 \\(m, 1H), 3.32 \\(s, 3H), 3.36-3.41 \\(m, 5H), 3.53 \\(t, 2H), 3.89-3.99 \\(m, 2H), 4.32-4.45 \\(m, 2H), 4.50 \\(d, 1H), 6.80 \\(d, 2H, Ar-H), 7.09 \\(d, 2H, Ar-H), 7.68 \\(d, 1H, Ar-H) and 8.60 \\(s, 1H, Ar-H)\r\n\n\nHRMS \\(m/z) 633.3098\\(\\[M+Na]+, 30%)\r\n\n\nAnalysis \\(calculated, found for C33H43FN4O6), C \\(64.90, 64.74) H \\(7.10, 7.02) N \\(9.17, 9.20)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSecond eluted diastereomer \\(DsA-2): \r\n\n\nYellow-brown, m.p. 132-136\u25cbC\r\n\n\nSpecific rotation = -38 o \\(c =0.5, MeOH at 25 \u25cbC)\r\n\n\nUV \\(294 nm, \u03bbmax in MeOH)\r\n\n\nIR \\(KBr, cm-1): 3300, 2930, 2852, 1709, 1627, 1575, 1440, 1383, 1316, 1244, 1089\r\n\n\n1H NMR \\(400MHz, CDCl3) delta- \\(d, 6H), 1.59 \\(d, 3H), 2.06 \\(s, 1H), 2.36 \\(s, 3H), 2.54 \\(s, 4H), 2.75 \\(t, 2H), 2.92 \\(m, 1H), 3.11 \\(d, 1H), 3.20 \\(m, 1H), 3.30 \\(s, 3H), 3.35-3.42 \\(m, 5H), 3.53 \\(t, 2H), 3.89-3.97 \\(m, 2H), 4.31-4.43 \\(m, 2H), 4.48 \\(d, 1H), 6.81 \\(d, 2H, Ar-H), 7.09 \\(d, 2H, Ar-H), 7.68 \\(d, 1H, Ar-H) and 8.59 \\(s, 1H, Ar-H)\r\n\n\nHRMS \\(m/z) 633.3098 \\(\\[M+Na]+, 30%)\r\n\n\nAnalysis \\(calculated, found for C33H43FN4O6) C \\(64.90, 64.69) H \\(7.10, 7.14) N \\(9.17, 9.22) \r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nComparison with competing chiral derivatizing agents and applications\r\n\n\nThe newly synthesized CDRs were found to provide better resolution \\(3.41-9.09) in comparison to the resolution reported in the literature \\(Table-2).

        "manuscriptAbstract": "An effective and simple protocol is described that successfully leads to liquid chromatographic enantioseparation of racemic beta-blockers by derivatization approach \\(with an example established with \\(RS)-metoprolol, and verified by using \\(RS)-atenolol). The chiral derivatizing reagents \\(CDRs) were synthesised using \\(S)-levofloxacin as the chiral moiety. The effectiveness of this protocol is not limited to enantioseparation but also to determine absolute configuration of diastereomers. The protocol describes \\(i) synthesis of CDRs by reaction of \\(S)-levofloxacin with N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-hydroxybenzotriazole in presence of coupling reagent dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, \\(ii) synthesis of diastereomers of racemic beta-blockers under microwave irradiation, \\(iii) separation of diastereomers by HPLC and open column chromatography, and \\(iv) determination of absolute configuration of diastereomers. The \\(S)-Lfx based CDRs provide very low limit of detection \\(LOD) and limit of quantitation \\(LOQ); they can be successfully used in trace analysis of several other racemic compounds containing amino group \\(e.g., beta-blockers, amino acids etc).",
