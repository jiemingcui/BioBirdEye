Recently, we have demonstrated that the solid phase prepared on a photoactivated surface gave around 1.5\u20132 fold higher readings than the untreated  surface when the assay was carried out at 37degree Celsius in around 8 hours \\(1). In this study, we have shown that an ELISA can be carried out in less than 3 h at elevated temperature on a photoactivated plate \\(2,3)."

            "content": "\u2022 Conventional ELISA procedures are normally carried out at 37 degree Celsius through adsorption onto polystyrene microtiter plates. Customarily, ELISA has not been carried out at elevated temperatures, possibly anticipating the fact that the antigen or antibody would be denatured or desorbed from the solid surface at higher temperature resulting in lower ELISA values. In fact, when a solid phase was prepared on an untreated surface at higher temperature, ELISA values decreased slowly beyond 37 degree Celsius. In contrast, an activated surface showed increased immobilization of biomolecule beyond 37degree Celsius, which prompted us to study ELISA performance at elevated temperatures.  Moreover, we did not obtain any undesired ELISA experiment by HELISA method in last 10 years or so.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 When immobilization of goat anti-human IgG was carried out in a time dependent experiment at 50 degree Celsius, 40 min was found to give maximum absorbance beyond which no further increase in absorbance was observed.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 The optimum temperature for blocking was found to be 40 degree Celsius. Nonspecific binding beyond 45 degree Celsius suggested the delicate nature of BSA binding. Being a weak binding, BSA may desorp from the solid phase at elevated temperatures giving rise to nonspecific binding.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 The optimum time for affinity binding of human IgG at 50 degree Celsius was 45 min beyond which the absorbance remain unchanged \\( Fig. 1).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 A 40-min incubation time was found to be optimum for maximum binding of the second antibody-conjugate \\( Fig. 2).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 The heat-mediated ELISA procedure was found to enhance assay speed without affecting specificity and sensitivity. This procedure also permits the detection of minute quantities of human IgE in less than 3 h with comparable results to those obtained in about 18 h by conventional methods.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Initially all experiments were standardized on an activated polycarbonate plates \\(PCR plates).  However, activated polystyrene plate \\(conventional ELISA plate) showed similar results \\(see PC3 and PS3 in figure 3). Hence forth, we have routinely carried out HELISA on any type of activated surface without any undesired results.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 The HELISA procedure is a potential alternative to the conventional ELISA carried out at 37 degree Celsius. The method was found to reproduce in cell-ELISA \\(3). It may also find potential applications in other solid phase based assays."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "In this protocol, we report substantial decrease in time for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA) technique by performing it at elevated temperature on an activated surface. The activated plate was able to bind covalently anti-human IgG at 50 degree Celsius over 40 min to form a solid phase. Blocking, human IgG and antibody\u2013enzyme conjugate binding were performed on this solid phase at 40 degree Celsius in 40 min, 50 degree Celsius in 45 min and 50 degree Celsius in 40 min, respectively. The ELISA readings obtained were 1.5-fold higher than those obtained at 37degree Celsius over similar incubation times. Total IgE was also determined by the heat-mediated ELISA \\(HELISA) technique in less than 3 h without compromising sensitivity and specificity of the assay. As surface activation can be achieved by application of a simple technique, the HELISA procedure could be a powerful alternative to conventional ELISA.",
