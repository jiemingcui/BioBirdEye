Cells were cultured in 10%FBS medium for 16 hours to reach a 70-80% confluent.\r\n\n\n2) Transfection was carried out with the modified calcium phosphate transfection method\n3\nas follows: Replace the medium of the Plan-E cells in 10-cm dish with 7.5 ml fresh 10% FBS medium. For each factor, 1068\u03bcl ddH\n2\nO, 25\u03bcg plasmid, 156.25\u03bcl 2M CaCl\n2\n, 1.25ml 2XHBS\\(total 2.5ml) were added to a 15ml tube successively. Mix vigorously after adding the 2XHBS, and then incubate for 2 min at Room temperature. Transfer the 2.5 ml mixture into the dish that had replaced with 7.5ml fresh medium above. \r\n\n\n3) 11-14 hours after transfection, replace the medium of the transfected 10 cm plat-E cell dishes with 10ml fresh medium.

A 10ml fresh Plan-E medium was added to the transfected Plat-E cells and harvest 24 hours later as the second virus stock.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Preparation of the OG2 MEFs**\r\n\n\nThawing the frozen Passage 1 OG2 MEF into a 6 cm dish with MEF Medium, and cultured in the CO2 incubator to reach a 100% confluence. Then split the MEFs to P12 or P24 plate at different cell density. \r\n\n\nNOTE: As the cell plated density have a significant influence to the reprogramming efficiency2. We adjusted the plated density according to the combination of reprogramming factors. In summary, a higher density was used for a lower reprogramming efficiency system and a higher density was used for a lower reprogramming system.
