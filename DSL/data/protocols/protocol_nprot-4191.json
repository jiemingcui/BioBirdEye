            "content": "Peripheral sympathoadrenergic cells develop from neural crest cells. An important pathology of the sympathetic peripheral nervous system is neuroblastoma \\(NB), where amplification of MYCN is strongly associated with poor prognosis \u0017\\(1) . Transgenic mice overexpressing human MYCN under the control of the rat TH promoter develop NB \\(2). Data from this mouse model point to SAPs as putative cells of origin of NB \\(2-5), a notion supported by recent findings of cooperation between MYCN and NB-associated ALK mutant in chick SAPs \\(6), zebra fish \\(7), and mice \\(8).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nExperimental access to NCSCs and SAPs is crucial for investigating normal as well as aberrant development of the sympathetic PNS. However, derivation of NCSCs and SAPs from ES cells and peripheral tissue is complicated by cellular heterogeneity and low yield. In this methodology we provide step-by-step description to obtain ESC-derived NCSCs and SAP-like cells."

EB aggregates were then transferred from the hanging drops into 6 cm bacteriological petri  dishes and were further cultivated for 5 days in suspension.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Generation of ESC-derived Neural Progenitor Cells \\(NPCs):**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nEmbryoid bodies \\(EBs) generated from mESCs by the hanging drop method were plated in Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Medium containing 10% FCS on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes. After 1 day, medium was replaced with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium:Ham\u2019s F-12 \\(DMEM/F-12) supplemented with 5 \u00b5g/ml insulin, 50 \u00b5g/ml transferrin, 30 nM selenium and 5 \u00b5g/ml fibronectin. Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 7 days, generating NPCs.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Enrichment of NCSCs from NPCs with CD57 expression sorting:**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDissociated NPCs were plated on poly-D-lysine/fibronectin \\(both at 150 \u00b5g/ml) coated culture dishes and cultured in NCSC medium, consisting of 5:3 DMEM low-glucose:neurobasal medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF, 20 ng/ml IGF-1, 1% N2 supplement, 2% B27 supplement, 35 ng/ml retinoic acid, 50 \u00b5M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 15% chicken embryonic extract. The cells were cultured for 7 days in a hypoxia chamber adjusted to 3% oxygen. FACS sorting of low-enriched NCSC-like population for expression of CD57 generated higher-enriched NCSC-like cells. CD57 antibody \\(clone NK1, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for FACS sorting.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Higher Enrichment of SAP-like Cells by Sorting for Expression of GD2:**\r\n\n\nLow-enriched NCSC-like population were FACS-sorted for GD2 expression to generate highly-enriched SAP-like cells. GD2 antibody \\(Clone 14.G2a, BD Biosciences) was used to stain the cells for 30 min, followed by FACS sorting."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Sympathoadrenergic progenitor cells \\(SAPs) of the peripheral nervous system \\(PNS) are important for normal development of the sympathetic PNS. SAPs are also thought to be the cell of origin of neuroblastoma, a sympathetic PNS-related childhood tumor. However, it remains difficult to isolate sufficient numbers of SAPs. This protocol describes methodology for the generation of SAPs by differentiating murine embryonic stem cells \\(ESCs). These advances in SAP generation may facilitate investigations about the normal development and malignant transformation of the sympathetic PNS.",
