            "content": "Trafficking of lymphocytes through lymphatics and secondary lymphoid organs is crucial for immunity. While the process of T lymphocyte migration across high endothelial venules \\(HEV) into lymph nodes \\(LN) is well characterized, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that regulate migration of lymphocytes from tissues into afferent lymphatics. Several groups have attempted to develop in vitro methods to investigate lymphatic migration. Culture of freshly isolated lymphatic endothelial cells has proven very difficult, and ultimately no cell line produced has been shown to retain a lymphatic lineage after multiple rounds of passage.\r\n\n\nThe C3H/HeJ mouse endothelial line SVEC4-10 is an SV-40 transformant of endothelial cells isolated from the axillary LN, and has been variously reported as lymphatic, HEV, or blood microvascular endothelium. We have characterized this cell line via flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and gene array analysis, and have determined that it represents a lymphatic endothelial cell lineage. We have also shown that migration of T cells across this cell line in vitro recapitulates in vivo migration of T cells, across lymphatic endothelial cells such that T cells migrate only in a basal \\(abluminal) to apical \\(luminal) direction. This protocol outlines the methods for manipulating these cells and performing transendothelial migration."

Place plate into incubator at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours.\r\n\n\n5) Passage cells as described in manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Place cells into 50cc conical tube and centrifuge at 250 x g, 4\u00b0C, 5 minutes.\r\n\n\n6) Discard supernatant.  Add 1 ml culture medium and count live cells with 0.02% Trypan Blue.  \r\n\n\n7) Resuspend cells at a concentration of 7.5x10\n5\ncells/ml.\r\n\n\n8) Remove plate from incubator and remove liquid gelatin overlying insert with pipette, being careful not to scratch or puncture the membrane. \r\n\n\n9) Place 100 \u03bcl of resuspended cells \\(7.5x10\n4\ncells) on inverted gelatin covered transwell insert. \r\n\n\n10) Replace into incubator for 3 days. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAssess confluence of endothelial cells on transwell inserts:\r\n\n\n1) Remove culture plate from incubator.

Add 100 \u03bcl of previously prepared T cells \\(5x10\n5\ncells) to upper chamber of transwell.  Set up wells in triplicate for each condition.\r\n\n\n5) Incubate, 37\u00b0C, 4 hours.\r\n\n\n6) Remove plate from incubator. Remove transwell inserts and gently agitate remaining unmigrated cells in upper chamber with a pipette and remove for quantification. Membranes with endothelial monolayers can be removed with sharp forceps and stained per local laboratory protocol to asses cells within endothelium.\r\n\n\n7) Resuspend cells in lower well in 1 ml medium and count using hemacytometer to quantify migration."

If the endothelial cells were grown on the upper surface of the insert, T cells would first contact the apical, or luminal, surface of the endothelial cells.  By growing the endothelial cells on the inverted transwell insert, cells used for the transendothelial migration assay will initially contact the basal, or abluminal, surface of the endothelial cells, thus recapitulating lymphatic transendothelial migration in vivo.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAssess confluence of endothelial cells on transwell inserts, step 8: A confluent monolayer is essential for the experiment. If cells are overgrown, T cell migration across this layer will be impaired.  If there are large gaps in the endothelial cell layer, a much greater number of T cells will migrate and artificially inflate the measured transmigration."
