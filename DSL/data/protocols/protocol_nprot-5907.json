This protocol could also be used to quantify cells from culture, but here we only discuss genomic DNA extraction from whole tissues.  The protocol begins with phenol-chloroform gDNA extraction of homogenized tissue.  Once gDNA has been harvested, the barcode containing region is amplified with custom primers which allow attachment of Illumina adapters in a single step.  Finally, we discuss how to pool samples before sending your library in for sequencing.  The entire process takes 3-4 days. This protocol accompanies Rogers et al, Nature Methods, published online May 22, 2017 \\(nmeth.4297).",
