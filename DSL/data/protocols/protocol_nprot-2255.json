After gently pushing out the fecal content using a forceps, wash the small intestines gently twice in PBS and cut open longitudinally and in small pieces of approximately 1 cm using a scissor.\r\n  3. Place tissue sections in base molds and cover with OCT compound and freeze in dry-ice-chilled 2-methyl-butane. \r\n  4. Wrap frozen OCT-tissue blocks in aluminum paper and store at -80\u00b0C until used for sectioning.\r\n  5. Cut intestinal tissue sections at 5 \u03bcm using a Leica CM3050 cryostat, mount on glass microscope slides, subsequently fix for seven minutes in ice-cold acetone and air-dry for one hour at room temperature.  Fixed sections can be stored at -80\u00b0C in desiccant bags. \r\n  6. Using a Dako Pen, mount hydrophobic barrier rings onto glass slides by circling tissues to limit reagent use for staining. By doing so approximately 400 \u03bcl of liquid \\(blocking or staining solutions) per slide is required.\r\n  7. Rehydrate sections in TBS for 20 minutes followed by additional 20 minutes in TBS-T by placing them in slide-beakers applying gentle shaking.\r\n  8. Block unspecific binding of antibodies by incubating tissue sections in TBS-T supplemented with 10% normal rabbit serum, 10% normal mouse serum, 5% sterile-filtered BSA and 2 mg/ml of a rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody for 30 minutes in a humidified chamber. After removal of the blocking solution, dip the slides briefly in TBS-T and then apply mixtures of the fluorochrome labeled antibodies diluted in TBS-T  for 45 minutes in the dark in a humidified chamber.\r\n  9. After removal of the staining solutions, wash the slides three times for ten minutes in TBS-T, once with TBS and once with PBS in slide-beakers applying gentle shaking.\r\n  10. Stain the slides with DAPI nucleic acid stain for 30 seconds and wash three times with PBS in slide-beakers applying gentle shaking.\r\n  11. Mount the slides with Gel/Mount medium putting coverslips.\r\n  12. Acquire images with a Leica DMRA2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Retiga EXi digital camera using OpenLab software. When comparing tissues of diverse genotypes, keep picture acquisition settings and exposure times for every fluorescent channel constant.\r\n  13. Process images utilizing Photoshop CS5. When comparing images of diverse genotypes or comparing specific antibody staining with isotype controls, adjustments of input and output levels was applied for all compared images in an equal manner.\r\n  14. Count the numbers of small intestinal LP IgA+ plasma cells and CD8\u03b1+ cells in a blinded fashion utilizing ImageJ. Analyse and quantify a total of five separate images from sections of six mice per group."

We highly recommend to always apply a nucleic acid stain \\(DAPI) or staining intestinal epithelial cell s \\(EpCAM) as this will indicate you the quality of you tissue sections. Tissues depicting torn epithelial layers and/or disintegrated nuclei should be discarded. \r\n  2. As some stains might be dim, we recommend to immediately acquire pictures after staining tissues. Avoid light exposure of stained tissues at all times.\r\n  3. As staining intracellular antigens expressed at low levels can result in false positive results, we recommend to always include isotype control staining. If possible apply control staining utilizing tissues from TNF\u03b1 and/or iNOS-deficient animals.\r\n  4. Spinning the intracellular cocktail before you use it helps to minimize the background."

            "content": "Applying this staining methods we observes that IgA expression co-localizes with  the expression of iNOS and TNF\u03b1 with some, but not all IgA+ cells in the small intestinal LP tissue. Occasional co-expression of both iNOS and TNF\u03b1 was observed in IgA+ cells, consistent with our flow cytometry data. Taken together, we have found that a proportion of IgA+ cells within the small intestinal LP express anti-microbial mediators TNF\u03b1 and iNOS, while we do not detect significant expression of these molecules in other LP cells."
