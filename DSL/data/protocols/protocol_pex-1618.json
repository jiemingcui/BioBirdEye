            "content": "<p>Chondrocytes are derived from mesenchymal cells through the process of differentiation during embryogenesis. The differentiated chondrocyte is capable of synthesizing and regulating the extracellular matrix such as collagen type II, proteoglycans which are responsible for cartilage development and repair <sup>1\u20133</sup>. However, in various cartilage degenerative diseases, the chondrocytes transition itself to more flattened fibroblast cells with different morphological, genetical and biochemical characteristics which is characterized as dedifferentiation <sup>4,5</sup>. During this process, the production of extracellular matrix decreases whereas increase in collagen Type I and Type III is observed which disrupts the chondrogenic functions <sup>6</sup>.&nbsp;The molecular mechanism behind the shift of chondrocytes phenotypes is yet to be elucidated. So, it is of imminent importance to study the molecular process of chondrocytes differentiation and dedifferentiation in order to discover potential therapies to manipulate the activity to rehabilitate chondrogenic functions and morphology to prevent degeneration of articular joints in various cartilage associated diseases. </p><p>The highly recognized and accurate method used for studying this phenomena is chondrocyte culture. For this purpose, various cell models are deployed such as chicken, bovine, rat and rabbit, chondrocytes as they are analogues to human chondrocytes <sup>7</sup>. These cell models are used to study the molecular mechanism of various cartilage associated degenerative diseases. The conventional approach utilized to induce dedifferentiation in chondrocytes are comprised of adding dedifferentiating agents or techniques which are often highly expensive, require specific conditions and a long time period to convert the chondrocyte phenotype into fibroblastic cells <sup>8</sup>. These challenges hinder the scientific community to understand the molecular mechanism behind the transition of chondrocyte phenotypes and expedite the discovery of therapeutic agents for various disease. </p><p>In this protocol, we utilized 2 weeks old New Zealand rabbits to acquire articular chondrocyte that offers more genetic resemblance to human chondrocyte and can be used to accurately study the molecular mechanism behind cartilage degeneration. Whereas we have utilized 2-deoxy-D-glucose as a dedifferentiating agent which is relatively cheap and quickly induces dedifferentiation in chondrocytes as compared to other methods <sup>9</sup>. </p><p>All procedures performed in this protocol has been approved by the Chairman of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Kongju National University, South Korea.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

Small slices are readily degraded upon collagenase treatment causing harm to chondrocytes integrity whereas too big slices take considerable amount of time to melt during collagenase treatment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Excised slices of articular cartilages are then placed on the dish containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% penicillin and streptomycin.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dish containing cartilages slices are then transferred to the falcon tube containing 20 ml of PBS for washing. The process is repeated thrice to ensure complete cleaning and decontamination of articular cartilages.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the help of pipette, remove the supernatant and add 1 % of collagenase diluted in TESCA buffer of about 800 \u00b5l in the same tube along with 1.6 ml of Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing penicillin (P) and streptomycin (S) (Figure 3).\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then the samples are then incubated at 37\no\nC-5% CO\n2\nin the incubation chamber for 6-8 hours.\nCritical Point\n\u00b2\nGently mix your samples every hour to avoid cell clumping to extract as many chondrocytes as possible. Do not tightly close the lid of the tube to allow the entrance of air inside the tube.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After incubation, add 3 ml of DMEM containing penicillin and streptomycin in the samples and centrifuge it at 1000 RPM for 10 seconds.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The supernatant is transferred to another falcon tube and the pellet is discarded and fresh media of 3 ml (DMEM+P.S) is added on to the pellet.\nCritical Point\n\u00b2\nThe process is repeated thrice to remove any undigested cartilaginous debris and other chemicals from the samples to obtain fresh and viable cells from the media.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The supernatant obtained from previous steps are resubjected to centrifugation at 1000 RPM for 10 mins.\n10.\u00a0This time, chondrocytes will accumulate in the pellet and the supernatant will contain remaining debris which should be discarded.\n\u00b7\nCALCULATION OF LIVE CHONDROCYTES AND CELL CULTURE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fresh media containing (DMEM+P.S+Calf serum) is then added on to the pellet to stimulate the growth and prevent death of chondrocytes.\nCritical Point\n\u00b2\nThe suspended pellet immersed in DMEM+P.S+Calf serum is then gently tapped at the bottom to disintegrate chondrocytes adhesions with one another and to obtain individual cells.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Afterwards, 10 \u00b5l of sample is taken from the sample (DMEM+P.S+Calf serum) with the aid of pipette containing chondrocytes and then added to the diluted 0.25 % trypan solution (90 \u00b5l) prepared in microfuge tube.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Addition of samples in trypan blue solution is gently mixed with the help of pipette and then flow cytometry should be performed to estimate the concentration of live cells.\nCritical Point\n\u00b2\nThe calculation of live cells provides scientists to prepare the media accordingly for cell propagation and prevent cell death and loss of cells phenotype from happening.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cell seeding is then performed by preparing fresh DMEM+P.S+Calf serum media and transferring 1 ml from the previous media containing extracted chondrocytes on to the fresh media.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The propagated cells are then incubated at 37\no\nC with 5% CO2 in incubation chamber for 12 hours. Afterwards, the spent media is then discarded via a sucker and fresh media is added through pipette again to allow an exponential growth of chondrocytes for 2 days to reach the confluence level up to 70-80 %.\n\u00b7\nTREATMENT OF CELLS\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the third day, the chondrocytes are exposed with dedifferentiating agent (2-deoxy-D-glucose) in dose and time dependent manner.\n\u00b7\nCONFIRMATION OF DEDIFFERENTIATION\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The status of dedifferentiation can be evaluated by Type II collagen through western blotting.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alcian Blue staining can also be performed to check the proteoglycan levels. Reduction in the expression of these proteins indicate that chondrocytes are dedifferentiating and the vice versa."

These conditions commonly reported in different cartilage degenerative diseases. The methods used to induce dedifferentiation in cell models of chondrocytes are often time consuming or require expensive reagents. Here in our protocol, we describe the utility of using 2-deoxy-D-glucose as a dedifferentiating agent for rabbit chondrocytes for studying dedifferentiation process.&nbsp;</p>",
