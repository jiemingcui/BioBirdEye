            "content": "The yeast two-hybrid \\(Y2H) assay is one of the most widely adopted methods for generating interactome data, and has contributed to identifying complexes regulating disease\\[1] and to improving interpretation of disease phenotypes arising from genomic or transcriptomic variation\\[2,3]. However, broad-scale Y2H data acquisition remains constrained by the cost and labor requirements of tracking interactions and of the iterative screening necessary to generate complete interactome maps\\[4]. As described in the associated publication, we have developed CrY2H-seq \\(Cre reporter-mediated yeast two-hybrid coupled with next-generation sequencing) to enable massively-multiplexed yeast two-hybrid screening of high complexity bait and prey libraries. CrY2H-seq uses Cre recombinase as a Y2H protein-protein interaction reporter that functions intracellularly to covalently and unidirectionally link interacting bait and prey plasmids via specialized loxP sites that flank the protein-coding sequences. The linked protein-coding sequences serve as interaction-identifying DNA molecules that enable massively-multiplexed screening coupled with next-generation DNA sequencing to detect protein-protein interactions. Thus, large-scale matrix screening can be carried out _en_ _masse_ and interactome data can rapidly be generated."

Collect the cells from each plate by pipetting 3.5 mL deionized distilled water on to the plate, placing lid back on dish, and moving plate around in a circular motion on the benchtop so that all colonies become suspended. Remove lid, tilt plate to one side and pipette the collected cells across two wells of a 96-well deepwell plate. If 48 selection plates were used, all 96 wells should be used in the deepwell. \r\n  12. Seal plates very well and heat inactivate cells for 20 minutes in a 75 \u00b0C water bath. This step is to heat inactivate any proteins, particularly Cre recombinase, in the cells.\r\n  13. Pellet cells at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. Discard supernatant by first inverting the plate over a waste collection bin, then by tapping the inverted plate a few times on a clean absorbent pad or paper towel.\r\n  14. Add 300 \u03bcL of yeast lysis buffer to each well and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour at 50 rpm. \r\n  15. Carry out plasmid preparation following the QIAprep 96 Turbo Miniprep Kit protocol recommendations for purifying low-copy plasmids. Omit the use of P1 resuspension buffer since cells are already resuspended in yeast lysis buffer. Use double the volumes of buffers P2 and P3. Include wash step with buffer PB, and pre-heat buffer EB to 70 \u00b0C prior to eluting DNA from the QIAprep membrane. \r\n  16. Measure DNA concentrations using the dsDNA Quantifluor System \\(Promega) and the 96-well plate reader. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Amplifying Cre-recombined ORF products from yeast minipreps**\r\n\n\n1.

Quantify the purified amplified library using a Qubit fluorometric quantitation kit.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Next-generation sequencing**\r\n\n\nTo identify both ORFs on either end of interaction identifying fragments, 100 bp paired-end reads are recommended and sequencing to about 40 million read depth should provide sufficient coverage for screens of 2000 x 2000 ORFs. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Processing of paired-end reads**\r\n\n\nA software pipeline to analysis the raw sequencing data is available in the Trigg et al. Nature Methods 2017 supplementary files. Below is a brief description of how the pipeline processes the raw data. Inputs to the pipeline are FASTQ files from one sequencing run.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n1. Reads are mapped using Bowtie2-2.0.2 \\[5] local alignment with default settings to a custom genome composed of Arabidopsis TF coding sequences from TAIR10, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, Gal4 AD and Gal4 DB domain sequences, and the empty CrY2H-seq plasmid sequences. \r\n  2. A quality filter is applied requiring reads to map with at least 30 matching bases, allowing a maximum of 2 mismatches, 2 insertions or deletions, and 2 bases of trimming from the beginning of the read.\r\n  3. Reads are then joined with their corresponding read pairs and included in the next analysis step only if both reads passed the first filter and mapped to Arabidopsis TF ORF sequences.\r\n  4. Clonal fragments are removed from read pairs if both reads in a fragment contained the same start positions.\r\n  5. Paired reads for which each of the mates aligned to a different ORF and showed the same strand orientation \\(Cre recombination occurs such that ORFs on pADlox and pDBlox plasmids become inverted in a 3\u2019-to-3\u2019 orientation) are included in further analysis.\r\n  6. A size filter is applied that requires the sum of the lengths of each read \\(start position of each read to the end of each ORF) and the lox region conform to the expected library size of 400-600bp.\r\n  7. Fragments mapping to ORF junction regions are totaled."

On day 1, archival stocks of bait and prey libraries are combined in one massively-multiplexed mate culture that undergoes diploid selection overnight. On day 2, the diploid culture is plated on media to select for cells with protein interaction-mediated Gal4 reconstitution and subsequent transcriptional activation of the HIS3 and CRE reporter genes. HIS3 expression allows cells to survive on selection media and CRE expression permits unidirectional plasmid linkage, where ORF combinations corresponding to protein-protein interactions become fixed together inside cells. After 3 days of selection, surviving cells are harvested en masse, plasmids are purified in a single prep, and Cre-recombined ORF junctions are amplified in multi-template PCR reactions. From these amplicons, an Illumina sequencing library is prepared and sequenced. A bioinformatics pipeline is used to identify fragments derived from Cre recombination PCR products.",

(a) Reads are first mapped to a custom genome composed of Arabidopsis TF ORF sequences, S. cerevisiae genome, Gal4 AD and Gal4 DB domain sequences amplified by AD and DB primers (primer region), and empty plasmid sequence (not pictured). Overall alignments were as follows: 74.8% Arabidopsis, 16% primer region, 4.8% not aligned, 4.2% Yeast, and 0.2% empty plasmid. (b) Paired-end high-quality mapped reads are paired by read IDs and clonal fragments are removed. (c) Fragments are filtered for DNA strandedness to remove reads mapping to only one ORF. Examples of one protein interaction fragment (blue, green, and orange fragment) and a fragment mapping to only one ORF (purple fragment) are shown.  Fragments are filtered by fragment size based on a 300bp size range (~220 bp - ~520 bp). (d) Fraction of fragments remaining after each filtering step in the analysis pipeline. Average and standard deviation were calculated from the ten replicate screen datasets. (e) Fragments for unique ORF combinations are totaled only if read1 maps to a different ORF than read2. Paired-end reads mapping to three example protein interaction PCR products are shown. (f) A basal fragment cutoff is applied and removes any interaction product with less than 3 fragments from the data, as shown by the carry-over of interaction products showing more than 2 fragments (peach/lime and blue/green interaction product) and absence of the blue/red interaction product which had only 2 fragments. (g) Datasets from each screen are normalized by calculating the median total number of interaction fragments and calculating a scale factor based on the fold difference between the screen and median total interaction fragments. Unique interaction fragments are then multiplied by the calculated scale factor and rounded down to the nearest integer. An example is shown for screen 8. ",

However interactome datasets are currently incomplete, limited by the throughput of existing technologies. Here we describe a massively-multiplexed yeast two-hybrid method, CrY2H-seq, for deep coverage interactome mapping. This protocol accompanies Trigg et al \\(Nature Methods 2017); it was added to the manuscript after formal peer review, as an aid to users.",
