            "content": "Pluripotent stem cells have several applications in cell therapy and tissue engineering to treat tissue injuries and organ pathologies, as well as drug screening and investigation of disease mechanisms <sup>1</sup>. \r\n\n\nEmbryonic stem cells \\(ESC), which are derived form the inner cell mass, have the capacity to differentiate into lineages of the three germ layers, i.e. mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm, and contribute to adult tissues including the germline. Other early embryonic tissues have also been used to derive pluripotent stem cells, including epiblast stem cells \\(EpiSC), embryonal carcinoma cells \\(ECC) and primordial germ cells \\(PGC). The expression of OCT4A, a marker of undifferentiated pluripotent cells which regulates the Rex1 promoter, is essential to prevent the early embryo from differentiating; for example, OCT4A-deficient mouse embryos lose pluripotency and differentiate into trophectoderm. Unfortunately, these cell types are difficult to expand ex vivo, poorly contribute to adult tissues and, similarly to ESC, are only available during the early stages of development. Consequently, their use is ethically challenged because their derivation is associated with destruction of the early embryo.\r\n\n\nSomatic stem cells, which can be isolated from most tissues throughout pre-and post-natal life, do not express OTC4A <sup>2</sup> or other markers associated with pluripotency; consequently, they show considerable reduced plasticity, only differentiating into a restricted number of cell types, usually within their lineage. The absence of pluripotency in somatic stem cells restricts their applications in regenerative medicine to treat injuries or diseases from the tissues of which they are derived. \r\n\n\nStrategies to revert somatic stem cells to pluripotency have been investigated since 1952, when Briggs and Kings developed somatic cell nuclear transfer \\(SCNT). They successfully created cloned animals by replacing the nucleus of enucleated oocytes with the nucleus of late stage embryos. Although cloned organisms present phenotypic abnormalities and cloning is technically challenging <sup>3</sup>, these findings supported the concept that the genome retains a capacity to revert to earlier states of plasticity and that the epigenetic modifications, which are responsible for cellular differentiation are reversible.\r\n\n\nSince 2006, induced pluripotent stem \\(iPS) cells have been generated from fibroblasts obtained from dermal biopsies by using retroviruses to ectopically express key transcription factors critical for the modulation of cell fate and maintenance of the pluripotent identity, i.e. the four reprogramming factors OCT4A, SOX2, c-MYC and KLF4 <sup>4</sup>. \r\n\n\nRecent data suggest that endogenous expression of the reprogramming genes may favour the reprogramming process of somatic stem cells with minimal or no ectopic factors, underpinning OCT4A expression as being sufficient to induce pluripotency. For example murine neural stem cells, which endogenously express SOX2 and c-MYC, were successfully induced to pluripotency through ectopic viral expression of OCT4A and KLF4 only <sup>5</sup>, and recently by OCT4A alone in both mouse and human neural stem cells <sup>6</sup>, <sup>7</sup>. In line with these findings, germline cells, which endogenously express OCT4A, have been shown to acquire pluripotency without addition of exogenous transcription factors, but instead via a chemical approach, for example Fgf2 and Leukaemia inhibitory factor \\(LIF) <sup>8</sup>,<sup>9</sup>. Other evidences suggest that modification of the culture conditions alone may induce pluripotency without genetic manipulations in OCT4A-expressing cells <sup>9</sup>. For example, Zhou et al. <sup>10</sup> reverted epiblast stem cells from a later developmental pluripotent state to ES-like pluripotency using small molecules supplementation.\r\n\n\n We recently demonstrated that Valproic acid confers functional pluripotency to human amniotic fluid stem cells in a transgene-free approach <sup>11</sup>. We found that human c-KIT+ first and mid-trimester amniotic fluid cells \\(AFSC) endogenously express OCT4A, although levels of expression are notably inferior to those found in ES cells <sup>11</sup>. Accordingly, AFSC do not fulfil the stringent criteria of pluripotency despite being broadly multipotent. We hypothesized that manipulation of culture conditions and the use of epigenetic modulators could revert OCT4A+ cells to functional pluripotency. We showed that culture of AFSC on Matrigel in a medium designed to sustain pluripotency supplemented with the histone deacetylase \\(HDAC) inhibitor Valproic acid led the cells to grow as compact colonies of small cells. These cells up-regulated OCT4A to a level similar to ES cells, and expressed alkaline phosphatase \\(ALP), SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4, NANOG, SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and REX1, which is expressed upon OCT4A up-regulation in cells with low or null levels of OCT4A. In addition, the reprogrammed cells expressed FBX015, a protein expressed in undifferentiated ES cells which is expressed during co-expression of OCT4A, SOX2, c-MYC and KLF4. The cells formed embryoid bodies in vitro and highly differentiated teratomas in vivo following injection into immunodeficient mice, showed reactivation of the epigenetically silenced X chromosomes in female lines and expressed hTERT. In addition, cells gained the ability to differentiate beyond the standard mesodermal lineages bone, fat and cartilage and formed definitive endoderm, mature functional oligodendrocytes, neurons and hepatocytes <sup>11</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Advantages of the method**\r\n\n\nOur method is legally and ethically acceptable as AFSC are derived from the amniotic fluid. It is also safe and suitable for clinical applications as the AFSC are reprogrammed to pluripotency without ectopic factors, even inactivated, but simply by manipulation of the culture conditions only. In addition, our method is fast and easy, as pluripotent cells can be generated within 8-9 weeks. Reprogrammed cells can be expanded to clinically relevant numbers and stored for either prenatal, neonatal or postnatal autologous use. They can also be used in allogeneic settings, since a bank of 150 donor cell lines would provide a beneficial match for up to 37.9% of the population <sup>12</sup>. \r\n\n\nWe have used VPA, a small-molecule HDAC inhibitor, which is US Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved for the treatment of epilepsy <sup>13</sup>. Previously, VPA has been shown to enable reprogramming of primary human fibroblasts with just two transcription factors, OCT4A and SOX2 <sup>14</sup>. VPA, which up-regulates OCT4A expression through factors targeting a proximal hormone response element, was enough to enhance OCT4A expression in AFSC, generating reprogrammed cells that were genetically stable over time.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Comparison with other methods**\r\n\n\niPS cells generated using retroviral insertion of the four Yamanaka factors are usually only partially reprogrammed as the retroviral vectors are silenced towards the end of the process. In addition, the risks of multiple random integration of the transgenes into the host genome, the low efficiency of the process, the stability of the pluripotent phenotype, the risk of residual activity or reactivation of the viral transgenes, as well as the potential risk of virally-induced tumorigenicity further restrain the application of virally-induced iPS cells. This pitfall is even greater when using lentiviral vectors, as these are less efficient in being silenced and could prevent the cells from differentiating later on <sup>1</sup>. \r\n\n\nConsequently, a number of delivery methods have been developed to generate integration-free iPS cells, including adenovirus <sup>15</sup>, Sendai virus <sup>16</sup>, episomal DNA plasmid <sup>15</sup>, <sup>17</sup>, and minicircle DNA vectors <sup>18</sup>, although the absence of genomic integration should be experimentally verified in all cases. In addition, the procedures using integrating vectors that are subsequently excised from the genome are also associated with very low efficiency <sup>19</sup>. For example, piggyBac transposons <sup>20</sup> can be removed after integration in the genome, although the screening of excised lines is time consuming. Finally, DNA-free pluripotent cell lines have been generated by direct delivery of either synthetic RNA <sup>21</sup> or protein <sup>6</sup>. However, non-integration methods are mostly inefficient or technically challenging, and although progress has been made to increase the efficiency of episomal plasmid vectors using p53 suppression <sup>19</sup>, this may also lead to genomic instability.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Experimental design**\r\n\n\nIn this manuscript, we describe a method for generating functional pluripotent fetal stem cells without ethical and legal restrictions. In principle, these cells could be used in the clinic for regeneration therapy, and have applications in disease modelling and drug screening. \r\n\n\nThe parental populations \\(human first and second trimester amniotic fluid stem cells) can be isolated during standard prenatal diagnostic, either multiple pregnancy reduction during the first trimester, or amniocentesis during mid-trimester, and do not require termination of pregnancy. These cells express OCT4A, which is absent in human first trimester fetal mesenchymal stem cells isolated from fetal blood, liver or bone marrow, as previously described by us. \r\n\n\nWe first describe the technique to isolate c-KIT+ AFSC from the amniotic fluid. To establish the parental population, the amniotic fluid is first centrifuged and the cells replated in isolation medium, where they are allowed to expand in sufficient numbers before being c-KIT+ selected based on their cell surface expression of the epitope. The cells show a fibroblastic morphology, with a spindle-shaped cytoplasm, and grow as a monolayer of single cells, as shown in Figure 1A.\r\n\n\nThe second step consists of adapting the cells to low growth factor culture conditions designed to sustain the maintenance and expansion of pluripotent cells in the absence of feeder cells. The cells are expanded on Matrigel in expansion medium \\(Nutristem medium, Stemgent) and passaged mechanically with collagenase. In these conditions, the cells show higher kinetics and grow as round and compact colonies of small SSEA3+ cells which grow on top of flat colonies of SSEA3- cells that functions as feeders, as seen in Figure 1B. \r\n\n\n After two weeks in expansion medium, the cells are switched to reprogramming medium composed of expansion medium supplemented with Valproic acid \\(0.1-1 mM) for a minimum of 5 days, during which time the cells stop dividing but up-regulate expression of pluripotency markers OCT4A, NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4, express REX1, FBX015, SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81 and hTERT, and stain positive for alkaline phosphatase. The cells are subsequently returned to expansion medium and stabilized for a minimum of two weeks. They are able to form embryoid bodies in vitro and teratomas in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. When cultured in permissive medium in vitro, the cells express functional markers of neuron differentiation \\(NR1), produce urea \\(hepatic differentiation), and express markers of definitive endoderm, confirming their ability to differentiate into lineages of the three germ layers. The pluripotency state of the cells is also confirmed by the reactivation of the X chromosome in female lines. Finally whole genome transcription array should show a high homology with ES cells to confirm expression of ECM associated genes and other genes associated with pluripotency. The reprogrammed lines should show high kinetics and little senescence over time and should be genetically and epigenetically stable after long term expansion <sup>11</sup>. \r\n\n\nWe anticipate that the protocol described here for human amniotic fluid stem cells could be adapted to a wider range of human stem cells that express OCT4A in the parental population, although levels of expression are not required to be identical to ES cells. Such cell types include, but is not restricted to, human first trimester fetal chorion stem cells. Data from our laboratory indicate that these cells require an adaptation period to expansion medium of two weeks before Valproic acid can be added to the culture medium."

            "header": "Anticipated Results",
            "content": "**Parental population**\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Expansion**: AFSC should be plastic adherence and not form colonies but grow as a single layer of single cells.\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Morphology and cell size**: the cells should present a fibroblastic morphology with a spindle-shaped cytoplasm. Cell size should be assessed on light microscopy images of trypsinised cells in an haemocytometer using Image J. \r\n\n\n\u2022 **Immunophenotype**: the culture should not contain hematopoietic cells, as seen by the absence of staining for CD14, CD34, and CD45, and show low/null levels of HLAI and HLAII. In addition, they should express the mesenchymal markers CD73, CD44, CD105, CD29, fibronectin, laminin and CD90. Positive control should be human adult bone marrow MSC and negative controls should be human ES cells. \r\n\n\n\u2022 **Stem cell identity**: Expression of OCT4A variant 1, REX1 and hTERT should be performed by RT-PCR and show expression of OCT4A but not REX1 or hTERT. Levels of expression of other pluripotency markers, i.e. NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4, should be performed using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Positive control should be human ES cells and negative controls human adult bone marrow MSC and results should show either absence of expression of levels considerably lower than those found in ES cells. At the protein level, heterogeneity of the population should be analysed by flow cytometry \\(OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC, SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81 and CD24) and confocal immunostaining \\(OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4, SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81 and CD24). Positive controls should be human ES cells and negative controls should be istotype controls and human adult bone marrow MSC. Results should show that the cell population my contain a subset of cells positive for OCT4, but should be mostly negative for the other markers, with the exception of SSEA4. Measure of alkaline phosphatase staining should be negative. \r\n\n\n\u2022 **Whole genome transcriptome identity**: to complement the analysis of stem cell identity, the whole genome transcriptome should be investigated using the Affimetrix platform to complement the analysis of the stem cell identity in the parental population.\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Kinetics**: the kinetics of the population should be assessed to determine doubling time and senescence using growth rate analysis and cumulative population doubling over 60 days. These values will be the reference from which the increase in kinetics will be estimated in reprogrammed cells. \r\n\n\n\u2022 **Differentiation potential**: the plasticity of the cells should be investigated using the embryoid body assay and by testing the capacity of the cells to form teratomas after transplantation into immunodeficient mice. The cells should not be able to form either embryoid bodies in vitro or teratomas in vivo and not express markers of the three germ lineages.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Reprogrammed cells**\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Expansion**: The cells should now form colonies the cell morphology should change.\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Morphology and cell size**: the morphology of the cells should change, with cells becoming cuboidal and smaller in size compared to the parental population.\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Immunophenotype**: expression of the mesenchymal markers CD73, CD44, and CD105 should be down-regulated. \r\n\n\n\u2022 **Stem cell identity**: Cells should now express OCT4A variant 1, REX1 and hTERT. Levels of expression of other pluripotency markers, i.e. NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4, should be up-regulated with levels in the range of those found in ES cells. At the protein level, the population should be positive for OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4, SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81 and CD24 and show homogeneity of expression for these markers. Measure of alkaline phosphatase staining should be positive. \r\n\n\n\u2022 **Whole genome transcriptome identity**: whole genome transcriptome analysis should show >80% identity with ES cells, with the pool of genes common for the two cell types including genes involved in the maintenance of pluripotency.\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Kinetics**: the kinetics of the population should be significantly increased and the cells expanded long term without showing signs of senescence.\r\n\n\n\u2022 **X inactivation status**: the reactivation of X inactivation should be investigated and show downregulation of the Xist gene.\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Differentiation potential**: the cells should now form embryoid bodies and teratomas containing cells expressing markers of the three germ layers. The capacity of the cells to differentiate into functional endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal lineages should be confirmed. Examples include definitive endoderm, hepatocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes."

Since then, a number of methods have been developed to avoid the random integration of ectopic factors in the genome and the low efficiency of the process. Those include alternative integrating, non-integrating, excisable and DNA-free systems, but they all present challenges that prevail their use as a clinical and molecular tool. Here we present a transgene-free detailed protocol to generate human pluripotent cells from c-KIT+ amniotic fluid fetal stem cells. The parental populations express OCT4A and can be reverted to functional pluripotency through manipulations of culture conditions and Valproic acid \\(VPA) supplementation. The resulting pluripotent cells could potentially be used safely without ethical and legal restriction in the clinic for prenatal and postnatal autologous use.",
