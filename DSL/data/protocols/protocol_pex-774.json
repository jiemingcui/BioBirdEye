            "content": "<p>Pigmentation of the skin and hair are one of the most diverse traits in the animal kingdom and are crucial for camouflage, signal, and photoprotection from UV light. In mammals, melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs) maintain pigment-producing melanocytes that give the skin and hair distinct colours. Mutations in melanocyte lineages can lead to the formation of melanoma, one of the most dangerous and aggressive forms of skin cancers. </p><p>\tThe melanocyte lineage also offers an accessible and easily trackable system to study stem cell biology and tissue regeneration in mammals. MeSCs are located in the hair follicle at a region known as the bulge. As the hair follicle enters the regenerative phase (anagen), MeSCs transiently proliferate to generate pigment-producing melanocytes, which migrate downwards to the hair bulb to colour the growing hair from the root<sup>1</sup>. At the destruction phase (catagen), differentiated melanocytes are destroyed, sparing only the MeSCs once the hair follicle returns to the resting phase (telogen).</p><p>\tMuch of our understanding of MeSC biology and its regulation relies on our ability to robustly isolate a pure population of MeSCs. In mouse skin, MeSCs have traditionally been isolated using reporter lines, such as Dct-EGFP or Tyr-CreER together with Rosa-reporter lines<sup>2\u20134</sup>. However, it can be laborious and time-consuming to breed reporter lines, especially to bring in additional alleles to study molecular changes of MeSCs when harbouring different mutations.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAnother issue which hinders efficient isolation of MeSCs is the low number of MeSCs in the skin. Each hair follicle only contains about ten MeSCs. In total, MeSCs make up \u22641% of total cells in the skin. Thus, the MeSC population can be easily contaminated by other cell populations during fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). Our protocol addresses this issue by depletion of other abundant cell types (immune cells, dermal fibroblasts, and epidermis) first, before enriching MeSCs from the remaining cells.</p><p>\tOur strategy design was initially guided by and fine-tuned using the Tyr-CreER; Rosa-lsl-H2BGFP mouse line. We first compared the GFP signal with known surface markers which recognize cell types in the epithelium and dermal compartment using FACS. In addition, we conducted immunofluorescent staining on tissue sections to confirm the specificity of selected markers. From these analyses, we identified MeSCs to be positive for CD117 (cKit), with modest expression of integrin alpha-6 (\u03b16<sup>mid</sup>), but negative for CD45, CD34, CD140a, and Sca1 <strong>(Figures 1, 2)</strong>. CD117 is also expressed by mast cells, which are excluded by their expression of CD45. In the anagen skin, CD117 is also expressed by the matrix cells of the hair follicle and mature melanocytes, so an additional step to remove the hair bulb is necessary to enrich for MeSCs in anagen. The purity of these MeSCs has been validated by qRT-PCR as well as RNAseq<sup>5</sup>.</p><p>\tThe following protocol describes a step-by-step process for isolating MeSC populations from mouse skin.&nbsp;</p>"

Melanocyte stem cells were then identified as CD34-/\u03b16mid/CD117+ cells. The isolation of melanocyte stem cells using this gating scheme was confirmed based upon melanocyte lineage specific expression of a GFP reporter (Tyr-CreER; Rosa-lsl-H2BGFP).",

Dysfunction of MeSCs can result in conditions such as hair greying, hypo- or hyper-pigmentation disorders, and melanoma. Here we describe a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) strategy for isolating MeSCs from mouse skin. The isolated MeSCs can be used in a multitude of experiments including gene expression analysis, transplantation, and others.</p>",
