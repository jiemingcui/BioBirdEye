            "content": "Genetically modified T cells expressing anti-CD19 CARs have showcased their efficacy in various liquid cancers 1-5, and have been approved for clinical use in B-cell lymphomas and leukemias 6-8. Currently used delivery platforms are primarily based on lentivirus or retrovirus. Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been used for targeted knockin of anti-CD19 CAR into the T cell receptor \u03b1 constant \\(TRAC) region, which have shown higher efficacy of tumor eradiation in mice 9. The generally used method to modify human T cells is currently based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system 10. Cas12a/Cpf1 hold advantages over Cas9 as it can process crRNA arrays by itself and mediate multi-target DNA cleavage in a single customized array. In the associated publication, we describe a new method for generating CAR-T cells using a combination of mRNA electroporation for LbCpf1 and AAV6 for crRNA and homology-directed repair \\(HDR) template. We achieved simple yet highly efficient targeting of both HDR-mediated CAR-T knockin and immune checkpoint gene knockout \\(KIKO). Notably, we were also able to deliver anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 CARs for bispecific CARs at high efficiency, demonstrating the modularity and extensibility of this system. Other advantages of this method include design simplicity, higher delivery efficiency, lower toxicity, reduced exhaustion, increased effector function, and long term CAR enrichment. The efficiency of this approach makes it readily feasible to produce single knockin or double knockin CAR-T cells on the order of 1e8 to 1e9 from a regular source of blood in two to three weeks, which is the scale and timeline typically needed in the clinical setting. Figure 1 illustrates a simple workflow for the generation and functional testing of CAR-T cells using the AAV-Cpf1 KIKO system. We anticipate this system to be of use to the scientific community for CAR-T research and production."

After purification, denature 200 ng of purified PCR product, anneal, and digest with T7E1, 37\u2103 45min  \\(New England BioLabs).\r\n  5. Load digested PCR products into 2% E-gel EX and quantify DNA fragment abundance using E-Gel\u2122 Low Range Quantitative DNA Ladder \\(ThermoFisher).\r\n  \r\n\n\nHDR quantification and NGS sequencing analysis\r\n\n\nSemi-quantitative In-Out PCR \r\n\n\n1. Use three primers for In-Out PCR:\r\n               TRAC 1st: binds to a sequence from the left TRAC homology arm\r\n\n\n             TRAC 2st: binds to genomic sequence outside of this AAV donor \r\n\n\n             CD22CAR 3rd: recognizes a sequence contained in the m971-BBz cassette\r\n\n\nTRAC 1st: CCCTTGTCCATCACTGGCAT\r\n\n\nTRAC 2st: GCACACCCCTCATCTGACTT\r\n\n\nCD22CAR 3rd: GAAATCAAAGCGGCCGCAG\r\n\n\n2.

Prepped libraries were sequenced using 100-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument or equivalent.\r\n  \r\n\n\nIndel quantification \r\n\n\n1. Some PCR products from amplification around cutting site of genomic DNA \\(same samples as T7E1 assay) were used for Nextera library preparation following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols \\(Illumina).\r\n  2. Prepped libraries were sequenced using 100-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument or equivalent \\(generating 29 to 74 million reads per library).\r\n  3.

Discard soft-clipped reads \\(identified with \u201cS\u201d character in CIGAR string).\r\n  6. Identify indel reads by the presence of \"I\" or \"D\" characters within the CIGAR string.\r\n  7. Quantify cutting efficiency as percentage of indels over total \\(indel plus wild-type reads) within the defined window.\r\n  \r\n\n\nHDR quantification \r\n\n\n1. Map reads to possible amplicons based on primer combinations and HDR status.\r\n  2. Define \"informative\" amplicons as truncated so that 100bp reads would have at least 20bp homology with the CAR sequence \\(or with the other TRAC arm, in the case of wild-type sequences). Informative reads can be used to distinguish wild-type, NHEJ and HDR reads with higher confidence.\r\n  3. Map paired reads to amplicon sequences using BWA-MEM with -M flag to generate SAM files.\r\n  4. Use SAMtools to convert SAM files to BAM, sort, index, and generate summary statistics of read counts with the idxstats option.\r\n  5. To quantify wild-type vs NHEJ reads, take reads that mapped to \u201cinfo_nonHDR\u201d sequence \\(described below), and call reads with indels \\(I\" or \"D\" characters within the CIGAR string) as NHEJ. Otherwise call reads as wild-type.\r\n  6. Pool read counts for downstream analysis. \r\n  7. Schema for our amplicon sequences and quantifications provided below:\r\n  \r\n\n\namplicon_nonHDR: refers to full amplicon from F1 and R1 of genomic, wild-type DNA.\r\n\n\namplicon_CAR_F1: refers to full amplicon from F1 and R1 of expected, integrated CAR.\r\n\n\namplicon_CAR_F2: refers to full amplicon from F2 \\(primer site within the CAR as opposed to outside) and R1 of expected, integrated CAR.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\ninfo_nonHDR same as amplicon_nonHDR, except truncated to 80bp of the TRAC arms.\r\n\n\ninfo_CAR_F1: same as amplicon_CAR_F1, except truncated to 80bp of the TRAC arms flanking the TRAC-CAR interface.\r\n\n\ninfo_CAR_F2: same as amplicon_CAR_F2, except truncated to 80bp of the TRAC arms flanking the TRAC-CAR interface \\(relevant to the right arm only, since F2 is within the CAR sequence). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHDR, NHEJ, and WT scores were calculated as follows:\r\n\n\ninfo_nonHDR = info_WT + info_NHEJ\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nhdr_score = info_CAR_F2/\\(info_CAR_F2+info_nonHDR)\r\n\n\nwt_score = info_WT/\\(info_CAR_F2+info_nonHDR)\r\n\n\nnhej_score = info_NHEJ/\\(info_CAR_F2+info_nonHDR)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCo-culture functional assays\r\n\n\nStable cell line generation\r\n\n\n1.

Plasmid purity is too low. \r\n  Plasmids possibly have RNA or protein contamination. Try to remove RNA and protein completely.\r\n\n\n2. HEK293FT with high passage number.\r\n  Use early passage of HEK293FT cells. \r\n\n\n3. Didn't concentrate virus enough.\r\n  AAV purified from one 150mm*25mm petri dish of cells should be concentrated to less than 200\u00b5l.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLow survival rate of cell after electroporation\r\n\n\n1. T cell cultured for too long.\r\n  Freshly isolated T cells are best, do not culture T cell for too long.\r\n\n\n2. Over-activation.\r\n  Over-activation of T cells by CD3/CD28 Dynabeads could induce cell apoptosis. If using CD8 T cell, decrease activation time.\r\n\n\n3. Electroporation program didn't set well.\r\n  The condition for Neon system is 1600V, 10ms, and three pulses.\r\n\n\n4. Multiple use of electroporation tips.\r\n  Electroporation tips are better not to be used more than twice.\r\n\n\n5. Too much virus.\r\n  Virus volume should not exceed 20%.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLow cutting efficiency\r\n\n\n1. Didn't do guide optimization.\r\n  Design several guides for each gene and choose the best ones.\r\n\n\n2. mRNA degraded.\r\n  mRNA should be stored at -80 \u00b0C, limit thaw and freeze cycles.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Low dose of Cpf1 mRNA used.\r\n  For 10\u00b5l reaction, should add 1\u00b5g of Cpf1 mRNA.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. T cell not active.\r\n  If not active, stimulate T cells by CD3/CD28 antibody / beads before electroporation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5. Wrong buffer used.\r\n  R buffer has higher electroporation efficiency than T buffer.\r\n\n\n6. Virus titer is too low.\r\n  Concentrate AAV to smaller volume.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLow HDR efficiency\r\n\n\n1. Virus titer is too low.\r\n  Concentrate AAV to smaller volume.\r\n\n\n2. HDR arm is too short.\r\n  HDR arms should ideally not be shorter than 300bp.\r\n\n\n3. AAV vector design problem.\r\n  If insertion site not at the first exon or near a promoter, add the promoter in front of CAR."

More recently, gene-editing technologies have enabled more direct engineering of immune cells. Targeting CAR to the TRAC locus has been shown to enhance CAR-T stability and function. However, current lentiviral, retroviral, or CRISPR/Cas9 based methods have various limitations in CAR targeting efficiency and modularity, especially for generation of multi-component CAR-T cells. Here we describe a new method, the AAV-Cpf1 KIKO system, using a combination of viral and non-viral approaches to generate a stable CAR-T with homology-directed repair \\(HDR) knock-in and immune checkpoint knockout at high efficiency in one step. This protocol accompanies Dai et al. Nature Methods \u201cOne-step generation of modular CAR-T with AAV-Cpf1\u201d.",
