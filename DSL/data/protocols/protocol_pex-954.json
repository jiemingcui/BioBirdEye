            "content": "<p>Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra-striatal pathway. The neuronal cell death results in mainly motor symptoms including tremors, rigid muscles, slower movement, and impaired posture and balance. Cell therapy for PD is a concept in which the lost dopaminergic neurons are replaced by surgery. As donor cells, authentic neural progenitors with ventral mesencephalic (VM) phenotype are needed. Developmentally, dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra are derived from fetal VM. Accordingly, aborted fetal midbrain tissues were used in clinical trials in the 1990s and showed some clinical benefit. Because fetal tissue is in short supply and its use has ethical issues, human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are being investigated as an alternative cell source for transplantation. There have been many reported protocols for mesencephalic DA induction from human PSCs at the laboratory level<sup>1\u20134</sup>. Most of them cannot be applied to the clinic as they are, however. To meet the criteria of clinical application, xeno-materials and genetic modifications to the cells must be avoided, the prevention of contamination and GMP compatibility must be confirmed, and regulations with respective countries must be met. We have established a differentiation protocol for dopaminergic progenitor cells (DAPs) from human PSCs<sup>5, 6</sup>&nbsp;and modified it for the purpose of a preclinical study and clinical application. The reagents and equipment are changed to clinical grade products to comply with the requirements by a Japanese regulatory agency.</p><p><br></p>"

This protocol induces human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to dopaminergic progenitor cells (DAPs) as clinically compatible donor cells in 30 days. The protocol includes starting with high density culture, cell sorting by using a cell surface marker for floor plate, and a maturation culture to form floating aggregates. The DAPs differentiated with this protocol were used in a pre-clinical tumorigenicity and efficacy study aiming for approval to start a clinical trial in Japan.</p>",
