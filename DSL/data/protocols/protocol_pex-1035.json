            "content": "<p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multilineage, self-renewing cells with the ability to engraft long-term when transplanted to an adult host. The first HSCs emerge during embryonic development from specialized hemogenic endothelial cells within the major arterial vasculature\u2014including the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. HSCs have significant therapeutic potential for use in cellular therapies and disease modeling. However, efforts to reliably and reproducibly generate HSCs in a stroma-free niche, and to specify HSCs from induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells, have achieved only limited success. To facilitate these efforts, a thorough understanding of the signals that are necessary and sufficient to support HSC emergence and development is essential. Previous studies generated an engineered platform to support Notch signaling in hematopoietic progenitors derived from human cord blood HSCs as well as murine bone marrow-derived HSCs<sup>1,2</sup>.&nbsp;These stroma-free methods used in-house engineered, immobilized Notch ligand (Delta1/Dll1) to support Notch signaling (and, in some cases, in conjunction with immobilized fibronectin fragment and appropriate cytokines to support expansion of short-term engrafting progenitors for therapeutic applications<sup>3</sup>). We previously identified conditions incorporating the use of immobilized Dll1 sufficient to support quantitative expansion of AGM HSCs derived from embryonic day 11 (E11), when directly engrafting HSC are first reproducibly detected in the AGM at low frequency. However, this niche was insufficient to support the maturation of hemogenic precursors isolated prior to E11 to engrafting HSCs<sup>4</sup> and was dependent on FBS-containing media which introduces unknown variability due to FBS components and batch variation, as well as artificial Dll1 ligand generated in-house<sup>5</sup>. Building on these prior methods, and leveraging complementary single cell transcriptomics to identify ligand-receptor interactions in the&nbsp;HSC-supportive AGM-EC niche, our lab has developed methodology for the maturation of AGM-derived hemogenic precursors to engrafting HSCs through culture in an engineered niche, using a stroma-free and serum-free platform incorporating Notch receptor-specific activating antibodies (in place of Dll1 ligand) and other commercially-available components. Herein, we provide details on how to replicate these results.</p>"

Here we present our protocol for an engineered stromal-free niche developed using complementary single cell transcriptomic analyses of HE/HSC and the AGM-EC niche to define ligand-receptor interactions sufficient to support HSC formation from embryonic hemogenic precursors in vitro. This protocol will be useful to identify and characterize additional niche-derived signaling ligands/pathways that may further enhance HSC generation from HE in vitro in a well-defined platform, and provides a basis for further translational efforts toward HSC production in vitro such as from embryonic or pluripotent stem cells.</p>",
