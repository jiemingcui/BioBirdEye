            "content": "<p>Adenine auxotrophy is commonly used in yeast research to monitor genetic and epigenetic events. Mutation or silencing events interrupting the adenine synthesis pathway lead to the accumulation of a red pigment under adenine limiting conditions. Colonies with a functional adenine synthesis pathway appear white. An advantage of this non-selective reporter system is that a direct semi-quantitative comparison of expression levels between colonies can be made on the same plates. Furthermore, the degree and stability of expression (pink, variegating and red) can be determined by comparing the amount and distribution of accumulated red pigment within a colony. A disadvantage of this non-selective reporter is the very time-consuming and tedious color classification of colonies by hand. Further, if components of the adenine synthesis pathway are expressed at low level (pink phenotype), classification can vary between researchers and screens, potentially leading to erroneous and not fully reproducible results. To reduce these issues, we have developed a highly accurate and automated colony classification method based on neuronal networks with whole plate images as input (Carl <em>et al; </em>bioRxiv, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/801845). In this protocol we describe in detail the procedures for plating and imaging as used for the pipeline training, which are crucial to achieve optimal results.</p>"

Having the same plating and imaging conditions as used for training of the network is key to this high accuracy. Here we provide a standardized protocol for plating of yeast and imaging within 5-7 days, compatible with the classification pipeline described in Carl <em>et al </em>(bioRxiv; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/801845).</strong></p>",
