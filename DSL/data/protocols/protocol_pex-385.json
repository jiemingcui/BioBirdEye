        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Physical interactions mediated by proteins are a critical element of biological systems, and the analysis of interaction partners can provide valuable hints about unknown functions of a protein. Two major classes of experimental approaches are used for protein interaction mapping: analysis of direct interactions using binary methods such as yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) or split ubiquitin, and analysis of protein complexes through affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. Thanks to his flexibility to low- and high-throughput approaches and a low operating cost the Y2H assay is widely used for high-throughput interaction mapping experiments. Moreover, it has now been shown that high-throughput methods can produce highly reliable interactome datasets<sup>1 2 3 4</sup>. Notably, in 2011 a proteome-wide binary protein-protein interaction map of the plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> <sup>5</sup> (Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping project \u2013 AIM) was described using a high-throughput binary interactome mapping pipeline based on the Y2H system and using a collection of ~8,000 open reading frames (8k_space). Here we describe a liquid pipeline for a high-throughput binary protein\u2013protein Y2H screen of a pool of 50 proteins used as baits against a collection of ~12,000 Arabidopsis proteins encoded by sequence-verified ORFs (12k_space)<sup>6 7</sup>.</p>",
