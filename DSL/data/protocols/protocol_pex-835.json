            "content": "<p>Transcription and its regulation determine cell fate and physiological functions, with dysfunctions in transcriptional regulation associated with various human diseases<sup>1</sup>. To understand global transcription regulation, genome-wide sequencing approaches have been developed to analyze the occupancy of RNA polymerases (ChIP-seq)<sup>2</sup>, or detect the presence and level of nascent RNA. Nascent RNA analysis is usually based on run-on assays<sup>3,4</sup>, metabolic labeling<sup>5,6</sup>, and Pol II-associated or chromatin-associated RNA enrichment<sup>7-11</sup>. Although powerful, these methods also have limitations. Run-on-based methods and Pol II-associated RNA enrichment typically require millions of cells as starting materials. Pol II ChIP-seq could not distinguish whether RNA polymerases are simply bound or are actively engaged in transcription<sup>3</sup>. Metabolic labeling may not be able to accurately measure transient and low-abundant RNA species, such as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), especially when using limited materials with modest sequencing depth. As most RNAs undergo post-transcriptional processing, their levels are indirect readouts that may not accurately reflect transcription dynamics <em>in situ</em>.</p><p>Transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases resolve DNA double helices and generate single-stranded DNA bubbles. Mapping ssDNA throughout the genome provides a readout of the activity and dynamics of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases.</p><p>Here we describe a rapid and sensitive labeling of single-stranded DNA for sequencing (KAS-seq, Figure 1), based on a kethoxal-guanine reaction<sup>12</sup>. We show that KAS-seq simultaneously measures the dynamics of transcriptionally-engaged Pol II, transcribing enhancers, Pol I and Pol III activities, and non-canonical DNA structures involving ssDNA <em>in situ</em>, by using as few as 1,000 cells or mice tissues.</p>"

            "content": "1. KAS-seq with mammalian cell cultures\nLabeling and DNA isolation\n1. Prepare 500 mM N\n3\n-kethoxal stock solution using DMSO. Then prepare the labeling medium by diluting the N\n3\n-kethoxal solution into pre-warmed (37 \u02daC) cell culture medium to a final concentration of 5 mM. It is critical to pre-warm the medium to facilitate N\n3\n-kethoxal dissolution.\n2. Incubate 1-5 million cells in the labeling medium for 10 min at 37 \u02daC. For adhesive cells, apply the labeling medium to the cell culture directly in dishes and incubate cells for 10 min at 37 \u02daC. For suspension cells, suspend cells in the labeling medium and incubate them for 10 min at 37 \u02daC.\n3. Harvest cells after the incubation. Isolate total DNA from cells by using PureLink genomic DNA mini kit (Thermo K182001). Elute DNA by using 50 \u00b5L 25 mM K\n3\nBO\n3\n(pH 7.0).\n[Stop point 1]\nBiotinylation and purification\n4.

Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 15 min with gentle rotation. After incubation, place the mixture on a magnetic rack to remove the supernatant and wash beads 5 times with 100 \u00b5L 1\u00d7 binding and wash buffer.\n11. Re-suspend the beads in 15 \u00b5L nuclease-free water and heat it at 95 \u02daC for 10 min to elute enriched DNA. Then put the mixture on a magnetic rack, and transfer the supernatant to a new labeled tube.\n12. In parallel with the previous step, heat the saved input at 95 \u02daC for 10 min. Then, put both the input and the eluted samples on ice immediately.\n[Stop point 3]\nLibrary preparation and sequencing\n13. Perform library construction by using the Accel-NGS Methyl-seq DNA library kit (Swift 30024). Perform PCR amplification for 7-8 cycles for the input samples and 12-14 cycles for the enriched samples.

Remove the supernatant and save the cell pellet at the bottom of the tube for labeling.\n4. Suspend 1-5 million cells in the labeling medium for 10 min at 37 \u02daC (refer to step 1 in the protocol for mammalian cell cultures for labeling medium preparation).\n5.

KAS-seq procedure involves N<sub>3</sub>-kethoxal labeling, DNA isolation, biotinylation, fragmentation and enrichment, library preparation and sequencing. The whole process can be finished in a day. KAS-seq enables rapid measurement of the dynamics of transcriptionally-engaged Pol II, transcribing enhancers, Pol I and Pol III activities, and non-canonical DNA structures involving ssDNA simultaneously <em>in situ</em>, by using as few as 1,000 cells or mice tissues. The robust and tissue-friendly nature coupled with low input material requirement make KAS-seq a method that can be broadly applied. This step-by-step protocol is related to the publication \u201cKethoxal-assisted single-stranded DNA sequencing captures global transcription dynamics and enhancer activity <em>in situ</em>\u201d<em> </em>in <em>Nature Methods</em>.</p>",
