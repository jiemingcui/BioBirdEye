            "content": "In eukaryotic cells, intracellular organelles are maintained under dynamic membrane trafficking, and high molecular weight GTPases play pivotal roles in membrane fusion and fission<sup>1,2</sup>. Mitochondria are also highly dynamic organelles, and their sequential double membrane fusions are regulated by membrane-bound GTPases<sup>2-4</sup>. The inner membrane \\(IM) GTPase optic atrophy 1 \\(OPA1)<sup>5 </sup>has multiple functions in the regulation of IM fusion, fission, and cristae formation<sup>6-8</sup>. However, it had been unclear how the dynamin-like GTPase mediate membrane fusion in mammals, since active L-OPA1 protein had never been purified.\r\n\n\nRecently we established a methods for expression and purification of human recombinant L-OPA1 using the BmNPV bacmid-silkworm expression system<sup>9,10</sup>. The bacmid-silkworm expression system seems to have various advantages for the expression of large membrane proteins compared with Escherichia coli expression system. Because bacmid preparation and silkworm culture is easy, the present method will have general applicability to the expression and purification of mitochondrial membrane proteins."

Add 100 \u2013 1000 ng of pFastBac HTb L-OPA1 into 100 \u03bcl of BmDH10bac competent ;cells. Note that BmDH10bac is needed for silkworm expression, not BmDH10.\r\n  2. Heat shock at 42 \u00b0C for 45 sec and place on the ice for 2 min.\r\n  3. Add 1.4 ml LB medium and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h in shaking incubator.\r\n  4.

Harvest the cultured cells by centrifugation at 4000 xg for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. If you hope bacmid DNA preparation later, freeze the cell pellet and stored at freezer.\r\n  12. Purified Bacmid DNA with a QIAfilter plasmid kit. We use Qiafilter plasmid Midi for 50 ml cultured cell. \r\n  13. Resolve the air-dried bacmid DNA pellet with 80 \u03bcl ultrapure water and determine the concentration. In our case, more than 160 \u03bcg of bacmid DNA is recovered from 50 ml culture.\nL-OPA1 expression in silkworm fat body\nDay1\n1. Prepare bacmid DNA-liposome mix: \r\n  Mix with 1.5\u03bcg bacmid DNA with 3 \u03bcl DMRIE-C per each larva. After incubation for 45 min at room temperature, add 50 \u03bcl ultrapure water. \r\n\n\nWe usually treat/rear 60 silkworm larvae at the same time.\r\n\n\n\\(Mix 1.5 \u03bcg x 60 = 90 \u03bcg bacmid with 3 \u03bcl x 60 = 180 \u03bcl of DMRIE-C, after incubation add 50 \u03bcl x 60 = 3000 \u03bcl ultrapure water.)\r\n\n\n2. Inject 50 \u03bcl mixture directly into the dorsal side of a silkworm larva with 30-gauge needle.\r\n  3. After 30 min, start feed artificial diet Silkmate 2S. \r\n  4. Culture silkworm for 6 days in climate chamber under 25 \u00b0C, 80% humidity.\r\n    We usually rear 15 silkworm larvae in 22 x 16 x 6.5 cm box with breathing holes and feed silkmate 2S everyday in the morning as bellow.\r\n\n\n  For 15 silkworm larvea\r\n\n\nday 1 \\(20 g), day 2 \\(30 g), day 3 \\(45 g,) day 4 \\(50 g), day 5 \\(50 g), day 6 \\(35 g). \r\n\n\nBefore feeding, discard feces.\r\n\n\nNote that silkworm larva only eat fresh mulberry leaves or artificial diet like as silkmate 2S.\nDay 7\nIsolation of fat bodies from 15 silkworm larvae\r\n\n\n5.

Using this method, we have shown how the dynamin-like GTPase and membrane lipids mediate membrane fusion in mammals in associated publication \u201dMolecular basis of selective mitochondrial fusion by heterotypic action between OPA1 and cardiolipin\u201d in Nat. Cell Biol..\r\n\n\n Because bacmid preparation and silkworm culture is easy, and the bacmid-silkworm expression system might have advantages for the expression of large membrane proteins in comparison with Escherichia coli expression system. the present method will have general applicability to various mitochondrial membrane proteins. It takes 5 days for bacmid preparation, 7 days for protein expression, 2 days for protein purification and 1 days for detergent exchange, respectively.",
