            "content": "Expression cloning using _Xenopus laevis_ oocytes has been proven to be an excellent tool for the structural/functional identification of proteins of all origins. Due to their great availability, large size and relative ease of handling, _X. laevis_ oocytes are optimal tools for the expression and cloning of proteins, when compared to traditional expression systems, such as _Escherichia coli_ or eukaryotic cell lines. The _Xenopus_ oocyte system, pioneered in 1971 <sup>1</sup>, is able to efficiently transcribe and translate injected genetic information; perform assembly of the foreign protein products; correctly process the nascent polypeptides; and target them to the proper subcellular compartment. Some advantages of the _Xenopus_ oocyte expression system over other functional expression systems \\(e.g. in somatic cells) are: easy and rapid transfer of genetic information by microinjection; simple handling of single cells after transfer of genetic information; high proportion of cells expressing transferred genetic information and good control of the oocyte environment<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n The general strategy used for expression cloning of proteins in _Xenopus_ oocytes will be  outlined below. Furthermore, the manipulation of oocytes, the protein assay \\(radiotracer uptake  measurements), cDNA library screening and cloning by expression, will be described in detail below."

            "content": "**_Xenopus_ frogs, Oocytes and Injections**\r\n\n\n1. For removal of oocytes, a Xenopus frog is anaesthetized for 15-30 min in half a liter of ethyl m-aminobenzoate solution. \r\n  2. The frog is then placed on top of crushed ice covered with wet tissue paper, to avoid the skin from drying out. A small incision is made in the upper skin of about 1 cm length, and a 0.5 cm cut in the inner skin and the muscular layer. \r\n  3. Using forceps, small clumps of oocytes \\(depending on the amount required, usually 500\u20131500 oocytes) are removed and are treated twice for 90 minutes in collagenase A \\(or D), having low trypsin activity in a calcium free ORII solution, in order to remove follicular layers. Typically, 10 ml of collagenase solution is placed in a sterile 15 ml tube, and after cutting the ovarian lobes into small clusters of oocytes, up to 3 ml of oocytes are added per tube. \r\n  4. The tube is rotated in the dark at 18\u00b0C on an orbital rotor spinning at low speed \\(20 rpm) for 90 min. and then replaced by a new collagenase-ORII solution for another 90 min. \r\n  5. The oocytes are then washed thoroughly 5 times with ORII solution, followed by 5 times with modified Barth\u2019s solution. \r\n  6. The oocytes are sorted for morphologically intact, healthy looking stage V\u2013VI oocytes. The oocytes are subsequently maintained in MBS at 18 \u00b0C \\(kept in the dark). \r\n  7. Usually on the next day, healthy looking stage V\u2013VI oocytes are injected with either 50 nl water \\(control) or mRNA \\(at concentrations varying from 0 to 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l), using a semiautomatic injector. Oocytes are then kept at 18\u00b0C in MBS for 1 to 7 days, with changes of MBS solution every 1\u20132 days. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Radiotracer uptake assay in _Xenopus_ oocytes**\r\n\n\n1. Oocytes \\(7\u201310 oocytes per individual data point) are first washed for 1\u20132 minutes in solution A. This solution is then replaced by 100 \u00b5l of solution A supplemented with the desired concentration of substrate \\(eg. 1 mM K2SO4), at the desired specific activity for the isotope. The specific activities for the different substrates used \\(eg.\n32\nPO\n4\n2-\n,\n35\nSO\n4\n2-\n) are usually between 10\u201340 \u00b5Ci/ml. Uptakes are routinely performed in the presence of sodium \\(100 mM NaCl) or in its absence \\(100 mM choline chloride) and incubated in a water bath at 25\u00b0C for various times \\(1\u201360 min.). \r\n  2. After the incubation, the uptake solution is removed and the oocytes are washed 3 times with 3 ml of ice cold stop solution \\(solution A).\r\n  3. Each single oocyte is then placed into a separate scintillation vial, dissolved in 200 \u00b5l of 1% SDS \\(allowed to shake vigorously for 45 min at room temp). \r\n  4. When the ooyctes have completely dissolved, they are supplemented by 2 ml scintillation fluid. Isotopic uptake \\(transport assay) is measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry \\(normally counted for 2 min/vial). \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Construction and Screening of a cDNA Expression Library**\r\n\n\n1. Using a functionally positive unfractionated or size-fractionated mRNA as starting material, a directional cDNA library is constructed using a commercial kit, following the manufacturers protocol \\(in our case the SuperScript plasmid system, pSPORT-1 vector, Gibco/BRL; SuperScript reverse transcriptase having no RNase H activity). The total library, usually in the range of 10\n5\n\u201310\n6\nclones, is subdivided into pools of 1,000 colonies, which are plated onto 9 cm Luria Broth plates \\(containing ampicillin 100 \u00b5g/ml). \r\n  2. When the colonies are visible, two replicas are made onto nitrocellulose or nylon filters with both replica filters being placed on top of LB plates \\(colonies side up) for about 6 hours until colonies are visible \\(1 mm diameter). \r\n  3. One filter is placed on top of an agar/glycerol plate, with the colonies side up and kept as a master plate at \u201380\u00b0C \\(sealed with parafilm). The second replica is submerged into 10ml Luria Broth containing ampicillin \\(100 \u00b5g/ml) and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C with shaking \\(300 rpm). \r\n  4. The cells are pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min and plasmids are isolated using a general plasmid \\(alkaline lysis) method. About 1\u20132 \u00b5g of plasmid are digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme cutting at the 3\u00b4 end of the insert \\(in our case NotI). An aliquot is run through an agarose gel to check if the digestion was complete and the rest is extracted twice with a mixture of 0.1 M Tris pH 8 saturated phenol: chloroform: isoamylalcohol \\(25:24:1) and then precipitated with 0.1 volume 3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volume cold 100% ethanol at \u201320\u00baC for 2 hours. Plasmids are then dissolved in 10 \u00b5l of water and used for in vitro transcription, using the appropriate RNA polymerase \\(in our case T7).\r\n  \r\n\n\n**In vitro cRNA-synthesis \\(including capping) protocol**. \r\n\n\n5. For in vitro transcription, the whole 10 \u00b5l \\(approx. 1 \u00b5g) of linearized plasmid DNA is used and is added to 40 \u00b5l of the transcription mixture. The reaction is incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour.\r\n  6. Then 50 units of RNAase inhibitor and 10 units of DNAase I, RNAase free, are added to the samples and incubated for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C to digest the remaining DNA. \r\n  7. The samples are then extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol \\(25:24:1) and precipitated by adding one volume of ammonium acetate 5 M and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, in order to remove free nucleotides. \r\n  Alternatively, after the extractions with phenol: chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, samples can be passed through RNase-free Sephadex G-50 Quick Spin columns to remove free nucleotides, then precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol as described above. \r\n\n\n8. The samples are precipitated at \u201380\u00baC for at least 3 hours and then are centrifuged for 45 min at 4\u00baC, pellets rinsed with 70% ethanol and vacuum dried for 5 min. \r\n  9. The pellet is resuspended in 15\u00b5l of water. 1 \u00b5l is used to measure the RNA concentration spectrophotometrically at OD\n260\nand 1-2 \u00b5l is run through a 1% agarose formaldehyde RNA gel, to check for integrity of the transcripts, with the rest being used for injection. \r\n  10. The in vitro transcribed RNA \\(cRNA) is directly injected into oocytes and after 1\u20136 days post injection, the protein \\(transport) assay can be measured \\(as described above)."

            "content": "In order to simplify the work, &#x201C;sib selection&#x201D; procedure is used to narrow down the positive plates and eventually find the positive clone. It is performed the following way: Assuming you want to screen 25 plates of 100 colonies each, the way you would do this is to place the plates into a grid of 5 &#xD7; 5 plates, with 5 columns and 5 rows. The columns you can denote A, B, C, D, E and the rows F, G, H, I, J. Now column A will be made up of plates 1&#x2013;5, column B of plates 6&#x2013;10, column C of plates 11&#x2013;15, etc. The products of rows and columns can now be pooled, either at the plasmid isolation level, or at the level of _in vitro_ transcription, thus reducing the number of reactions from 25 to 10 groups. In addition, once a positive group is found \\(let's say column A and row F), then you can exactly pin-point the positive plate in one step, by looking at the positive column versus its intersecting positive row \\(in this case it would be plate 1). This sib selection technique can be applied at the single colony step or at the steps with tens or hundreds of colonies per plate. \r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n Generally, pools of bacteria are only subdivided after the protein assay results are consistently positive \\(2 or more times). Typical expressed uptakes for different groups of colonies during screening are: master plates \\(1000 colonies) show at least a 1.5&#x2013;3-fold transport activity over background; progressive subdivision of one positive master plate down to plates of 100&#x2013;200 produce a 5&#x2013;8-fold increase in transport rate; subdivision down to plates of 10&#x2013;30 colonies show transport signals of more than 10-fold over background; and finally down to 1 positive colony, stimulation up to 40-fold over background. It is most important, that with each subdivision of colonies, an increase in the stimulated transport rate is necessary before proceeding further. For a general overview used for expression cloning of transport proteins, see Fig. 1."

Each plate of 1000 colonies is screened for expression \\(as described above) and once a positive pool of plasmids is found, the bacteria containing these plasmids are subdivided into smaller pools by one order of magnitude. These new pools are screened, as well as the master plate and then further subdivided by sib selection until a single clone, responsible for these increased expression in oocytes, is found. This part of the work can be very time consuming \\(several months) and is not always straightforward."
