Briefly, 2 \u00d7 10\n5\nprimed cells were plated onto a MEF feeder layer in mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 10 \u03bcM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Two days later, the medium was changed to 5iLA medium. After ~10 days, dome-shaped naive colonies were manually picked and transferred to a fresh MEF plate for further cultivation in 5iLA medium.\nb.\nNa\u00efve hPSC culture: Naive hPSCs were cultured on mitomycin C-inactivated MEF feeder cells in 5iLA or PXGL media as described previously\n2,3\n.\nNote:\nThe quality of starting na\u00efve hPSCs is critical for human blastoid generation. Typical na\u00efve colonies are shown in\nFigure 1\n. Prior to blastoid generation, it\u2019s important to first verify the na\u00efve hPSCs have the following features: 1) dome-shaped colony morphology; 2) the expression of several key na\u00efve pluripotency markers, e.g. KFL17, SUSD2, TFCP2L1; 3) a normal karyotype; 4) normal growth rate; and 5) the competency for extra-embryonic lineages via monolayer differentiation (described below).\nMonolayer differentiation of na\u00efve hPSCs\n1.\nPrepare 6-well culture plates coated with a 0.2% gelatin solution and incubate at 37\u00b0C for at least 30 min before preparing the cells.\n2.\nAt ~60% confluency, dissociate na\u00efve hPSCs into single cells by incubating in TrypLE Express solution at 37 \u00b0C for ~3 min.\n3.\nResuspend the cells in 5iLA or PXGL media and centrifuge at 200 g for 3 min.\n4.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 2 mL of 5iLA or PXGL media.\n5.\nTransfer the cell suspension into the prepared gelatin-coated 6-well plate and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min to remove MEF cells.\n6.\nCollect and re-plate the supernatant containing na\u00efve hPSCs into a 12-well plate (1 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells/well*) pre-coated with Matrigel in 5iLA or PXGL media.\n*Note:\nThe plating cell number will need to be increased if the cell variability is found low.\n7.\nHDM followed by hTSM method: after 1 day of culture in 5iLA or PXGL media, change the medium to HDM and culture for an additional 3 days, then change the medium to hTSM and culture for an additional 6 days.\n8.\nhTSM followed by HDM method: after 1 day of culture in 5iLA or PXGL media, change the medium to hTSM and culture for 6 days, then change the medium to HDM and culture for 3 days.\n9.\nConfirm lineage marker expression after 9 days of differentiation by immunostaining. A representative co-staining image is shown in\nFigure 2\n.\nNote:\nWe suggest using the following antibodies to verify lineage differentiation: epiblast (SOX2, OCT4, and KLF17), trophoblast (GATA3, GATA2, or TFAP2C), and hypoblast (GATA6, GATA4, and SOX17). After 9 days of differentiation, we found >20% of cells were either GATA3\n+\nor GATA6\n+\n.\nGeneration of human blastoids\n1.\nPrepare 6-well culture plates coated with a 0.2% gelatin solution and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for at least 30 min before using.\n2.\nPrepare an AggreWell\u2122400 plate according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, add anti-adhesion rinsing solution to the wells, centrifuge at 2,000 g for 5 min, and then incubate at room temperature for at least 10 min.\n3.\nAt ~60% confluency, dissociate na\u00efve hPSCs into single cells by incubating cells in TrypLE Express solution at 37 \u00b0C for ~3 min.\n4.\nResuspend the cells in 5iLA or PXGL media and centrifuge at 200 g for 3 min.\n5.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 2 mL of 5iLA or PXGL media.\n6.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a gelatin coated 6-well plate and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min to remove MEF cells.\n7.\nCollect the supernatant containing na\u00efve hPSCs and filter them through a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer.\n8.\nRemove the anti-adhesion rinsing solution from the Aggrewell\u2122400, wash the wells with 5iLA or PXGL media once, and then add 0.5 mL of 5iLA or PXGL media to each well.\n9.\nCount the number of na\u00efve hPSCs, and transfer ~30,000 cells (~25 cells/microwell)* to 1 mL of 5iLA or PXGL media.\n*Note:\nThe starting cell number needs to be optimized for different na\u00efve hPSC lines.\n10.\nTransfer 1 mL of the cell suspension (from step 9) into one well of a prepared Aggrewell\u2122400 plate (from step 8). The total volume in the well should now be 1.5 mL.\n11.\nCentrifuge the Aggrewell plate at 100 g for 1 min and place it in an incubator maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\n. Proceed to step 12 (HT method) or step 15 (TH method).\nSteps 12-14 describe the HT method (HDM followed by TDM):\n12.\nAfter 12 hours of culture, carefully remove as much 5iLA or PXGL media from the well as possible, and then add 1.5 mL of HDM. This is designated as day 1. Replace with fresh HDM media on day 2.\nNote:\nGreat care should be taken when working with the Aggrewell\u2122400 in order to avoid flushing aggregates out of the microwells (i.e. aspirate/pipette slowly and carefully).\n13.\nAfter 2-3* days of culture in HDM, carefully remove as much medium as possible, and then add 1 mL of TDM. Then carefully remove as much medium as possible (in order to completely remove HDM) (this can be repeated for 1-2 more times). Finally, add 1.5 mL of fresh TDM to the well. Replace media with fresh TDM every other days.\n*Note:\nIn our hands, there was no noticeable difference in blastoid formation efficiency when using 2 days vs. 3 days of HDM treatment.\n14.\nAfter 6-8* days of culture in TDM, cavity structures can be observed in some microwells.\n*Note:\nThe time to generate cavity-containing structures may vary between cell lines, starting na\u00efve hPSC culture conditions, starting cell number, and batches. Longer culture time in TDM may improve cavity structure formation.\nSteps 15-16 describe the TH method (TDM followed by HDM):\n15.\nAfter 12 hours of culture, carefully remove as much 5iLA or PXGL media from the well as possible, and then add 1.5 mL of TDM. This is designated as day 1. Replace with fresh TDM media every other days.\n16.\nAfter 6-8* days of culture in TDM cavity structures can be observed in some microwells. Carefully remove as much medium as possible and then add 1 mL of HDM. Then carefully remove as much medium as possible (in order to completely remove TDM) (this can be repeated for 1-2 more times). Finally, add 1.5 mL of fresh HDM to the well and culture for an additional 1-2 days.\n*Note:\nThe time of TDM treatment may vary as mentioned in step 14. Longer culture time in TDM may improve cavity structure formation. In our hands, there was no noticeable difference in blastoid formation efficiency when using 1 days vs. 2 days of HDM treatment with the TH method.\n17.\nOnce cavity-containing structures have formed, harvest all cell aggregates from the microwells by gently pipetting up and down for 1\u20132 times with a 1000 uL pipette tip*.\n*Note:\nTo minimize shearing force from pipetting, cut ~1 mm off the 1000 uL pipette tip with a sterile scissor in the culture hoood before using.\n18.\nTransfer all cell aggregates into one well of a 6-well plate, and then manually isolate aggregates with a discernible blastoid-like morphology* with a glass mouth pipette under a stereomicroscope for downstream experiments.\n*Note:\nAggregates with the presence of an ICM-like compartment, a TE-like out layer, and a visible cavity are designated as blastoids."

These structures, termed human blastoids, provide an accessible, scalable, versatile, and manipulable 3D model to study early human development, understand early pregnancy loss, and gain insights into early developmental defects.</p><p><br></p>",
