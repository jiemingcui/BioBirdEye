            "content": "<p>CRISPR-based genome perturbation provides a new avenue to conveniently change DNA sequences, transcription and epigenetic modifications in genetic screens. However, it\u2019s also a big challenge to profile the transcriptome together with genotype at single cell resolution.</p><p>To overcome this challenge, two optimizations are applied to the gRNA scaffold design without negative impact to the genome editing performance. One modification is that an A/G mixed capture sequence (a 30-nt sequence, in which one guanine was incorporated with every seven adenosine except for the first eight leading adenosine, \"AAAAAAAAGAAAAAAAGAAAAAAAGAAAAA\") was introduced into the Tetraloop, Loop2 or Tail of the gRNA scaffold to mimic the poly(A) tail of transcripts from polymerase II (Pol II). Therefore,&nbsp;gRNA transcripts&nbsp;can be captured and barcoded together with the endogenous mRNA via oligo(dT) from 10x GEM beads. The other modification is that a tRNA sequence, which locates at the downstream of the U6 promoter and upstream of the gRNA sequence, was included into the gRNA expression cassette to achieve multiplexed&nbsp;gRNA expression&nbsp;and also provided specific primer binding sites for the nest PCR.</p><p>The following protocol is used to profile the index gRNAs and&nbsp;endogenous mRNAs simultaneously at single cell resolution based on&nbsp;10x 3\u2019&nbsp;single cell&nbsp;RNA-seq platform. Single cell capture and mRNA library are prepared following the Chromium User Guide&nbsp;(10x Genomics, CG000184). The specific enrichment of&nbsp;cDNA from gRNA transcripts and the gRNA library construction are described in details and other&nbsp;alterations are also indicated in this protocol.</p><p>For application of the Octo-seq workflow in other single cell RNA-seq platforms, please refer to the Figure1.</p>"

The 1st step could use a scaffold-specific primer, and 2nd step could add the P5 and P7 sequencing adapters; (c) When work with the SMART-seq protocol, the cell barcode and UMI are suggested to be included in the template switch oligos (TSO) to enable sample pooling and eliminate PCR artifacts.
