            "content": "<p>Here we present a protocol for deriving climate-informed multi-species reference points for fisheries management. This approach builds of the sloping harvest control rule and maximum sustainable yield biomass proxy approaches currently implemented in the Bering sea (Alaska, USA) and modified to derive harvest recommendations as part of the CEATTLE multi-species stock assessment model<sup>1 </sup>(https://archive.afsc.noaa.gov/refm/docs/2019/EBSmultispp.pdf) for walleye pollock (<em>Gadus chalcogrammus</em>), Pacific cod (<em>G. microcephalus</em>), and arrowtooth flounder (<em>Atheresthes stomias</em>). The CEATTLE model has been updated annually and included as an appendix to the BSAI walleye pollock stock assessment since 2016 as part of the Bering Sea fishery stock assessment process.</p><p><br></p><p>The CEATTLE model is fit to historical survey and fishery data as well as hindcasts (1979-2017) of oceanographic conditions from a high resolution ROMSNPZ model for the Bering Sea (see<sup>1</sup> for more detail). We used hindcasts (1979-2017) (coupled regional oceanographic -nutrient-phytoplankton- zooplankton model; see2).The same ROMSNPZ model is then projected to derive harvest recommendations under future climate scenarios . Details of projection realizations that composed the ensemble members are available in <sup>2\u20134</sup>.</p><p><br></p><p>Future projections include selected models from the CMIP5 suite where the high resolution ROMSNPZ model is forced with boundary conditions from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 global climate model projections of atmospheric and oceanic circulation under climate change. Structural differences among global climate models can result in divergent trajectories; as part of the interdiscipilinary Alaska Climate Integrated Modeling project, three global climate models from a subset of the CMIP5 esemble members that reasonably replicated ice dynamics in the Bering sea were selected for this study: 1) the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) \u2013 ESM 2M (ESM2M) <sup>5</sup>; 2) the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth Systems Model (CESM) <sup>6</sup>; and 3) the MIROC ESM <sup>7</sup>.These three models were selected because they projected a broad range of global patterns for precipitation and SST, and provided contrasting views of future ocean conditions in the EBS. Output from these models under two representative concentration pathways or RCPs (4.5 and 8.5; 8) were used to drive the Bering10K regional ROMSNPZ model. RCP 8.5 and 4.5 represent a high-baseline carbon emission scenario and a moderate mitigation scenario, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This resulted in a suite of 6 projections of Eastern Bering Sea conditions including bottom and surface temperature, summer \"cold pool\", and large zooplankton (key prey resource) abundance during spring and fall (critical periods for juvenile pollock and cod survival). We additionally included a persistence scenario as our \"null\" climate-constant scenario (i.e., average of 2006-2016 conditions).</p><p><br></p><p>We use these scenarios to derive 1) projections without harvest (unfished spawning biomass) and 2) projections where in each year harvest was set to the sustainable limit using current management approaches (sloping harvest control rule and harvest rate that results in 40% of unfished spawning biomass). This approach is detailed below and is also used in <sup>1</sup>.</p>"

For each environmental covariate create the \"persistence\" projection using the average of the last 10 years of the hindcast ROMSNPZ model (i.e., constant future climate conditions).\n2. Determined average\u00a0climate-naive B\n0\nvalues in years 2095-2099 by projecting the model forward without harvest (i.e. F = 0)\u00a0for each species under the persistence scenario (i.e., mean historical climate conditions).\n3. Iteratively solve for F\n40%,\ni.e., the\u00a0harvest rate that results in an average spawning biomass (B40\n%\n) during 2095-2099 that is 40% of\u00a0B\n0\nfor pollock and Pacific cod simultaneously with arrowtooth\u00a0flounder set to the historical average (as arrowtooth flounder is a major predator of pollock and historical F for arrowtooth flounder is much lower than F\n40%\n).\n4. Once\u00a0F\n40%\nfor pollock and Pacific cod are found, iteratively solve for F\n40%\nfor arrowtooth flounder.\n5. To derive a climate informed\u00a0ABC\u00a0in each simulation year, the North Pacific Marine Fishery Council (hereafter, \u201cCouncil\u201d) Tier 3 sloping harvest control rule with an ecosystem cutoff at\u00a0B\n20%\nis applied such that:\na. if B\ny\nat the start of the simulaiton year is < 40% of\u00a0B\n0\n, F\nABC\n= F\n40%\nb. if (B\ny\n/ 0.4B\n0\n) > 0.05, F\nABC\n= F\n40%\n*( ( (B\ny\n/ 0.4B\n0\n) - 0.05 ) / (1 - 0.05) )\nc. else, F\nABC\n= 0\nwhere B\ny\nis the spawning biomass at the start of the simulation year for each climate scenario based on climate effects on recruitment, predation mortality, and growth, -- i.e., the climate-informed B\ny."

This approach follows the status quo North Pacific Marine Fishery Council reviewed multispecies assessment methodology and represents a precautionary approach that minimizes inflation of Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) due to predator release&nbsp;and also minimizes potential non-intuitive compound effects of climate change and fishing under declining conditions (i.e., whereby a climate informed&nbsp;B<sub>0&nbsp;</sub>declines with climate-change and produces a lower target biomass such as B<sub>40%</sub>).</p>",
