            "content": "This protocol describes a procedure to search for novel p53 target genes.  First, screen for potential p53 target gene using p53MH algorithm. Then, test these candidate genes using a series of molecular biological assays, including Chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay, luciferase reporter activity assay, and regulation of the expression levels of mRNA and protein of these genes by p53 protein.  This protocol also includes some assays to measure the mouse implantation and reproduction used in our study."
