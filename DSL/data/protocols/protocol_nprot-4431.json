            "content": "Extracellular RNAs \\(exRNAs) have been identified in every biofluid that has been tested. They have been found in extracellular vesicles, ribonucleoprotein complexes and lipoprotein complexes. exRNAs are interesting because they may serve as signalling molecules between cells, they have the potential to serve as biomarkers for prediction and diagnosis of disease, and exRNAs or the extracellular particles that carry them might be used for therapeutic purposes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe Sample and Assay Standards Working Group of the Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium \\(ERCC) is a group of laboratories funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health to develop robust and standardized methods for collecting and processing of biofluids, separating different types of exRNA-containing particles and isolating and analyzing exRNAs. In our first joint endeavour, we held a series of conference calls and in-person meetings to survey the methods used among our members, placed them in the context of the current literature and used our findings to identify areas in which the identification of robust methodologies would promote rapid advancements in the exRNA field.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA full list of the protocols developed during this effort is available at the exRNA Portal, the ERCC's website \\( \"http://exrna.org/resources/protocols/\":http://exrna.org/resources/protocols/ ). This protocol for performing RiboGreen quantification is one of the final steps in the process, allowing quantification of the amount of extracellular RNA found in a sample or biofluid."

Based on the expected concentrations of the samples, make the appropriate dilution of the RiboGreen reagent \\(Component A) in 1X TE \\(1:400 for samples between 2-100 ng/\u03bcL, 1:4,000 for samples between 0.05-1 ng/\u03bcL). You will need 20 \u03bcL of the diluted reagent for each sample and each standard.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Based on the expected concentrations of the samples, set up the assay plate with 1 \u03bcL each of the appropriate standards.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. In each well, mix 1 \u03bcL of sample/standard with 19 \u03bcL of the appropriate dilution of the RiboGreen reagent. Pipet up and down to mix.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Read in a qPCR machine \\(use FAM/SYBR channel). Export raw fluorescence values. Draw the standard curve, and use the linear trend line to generate the formula to calculate the concentration for each sample."
