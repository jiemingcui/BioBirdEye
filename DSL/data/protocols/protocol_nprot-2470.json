            "content": "The endangered pygmy hippopotamus \\(_Choeropsis liberiensis_), an endemic species to freshwater systems and forests of West Africa in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Liberia, resembles the common hippopotamus but is much smaller in size. It is a long-lived, solitary species where the sexes only meet for mating and where males defend territories, sometimes in fierce fights with competing males, which may have fatal consequences <sup>1</sup>. While little is known about their reproduction in the wild, the captive population reproduces well. In the captive population, offspring sex ratio is shifted towards an excess of females \u2013 at birth only 42.5% of offspring were reported to be males <sup>2</sup>. The cause of this shift and the mechanism by which it is achieved are unknown.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNoting the difference between the sexes in terms of investment in offspring and the benefits gained thereby, it has been assumed that owing to its usually much larger investment, the female has considerably more to win or lose and if mechanisms to bias offspring sex ratios do exist, they would be operated by the female <sup>3</sup>. Hence, both empirical and theoretical work has traditionally concentrated on the female and dismissed any potential paternal contribution as minor and irrelevant.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThere is only a very limited body of literature that has actually evaluated the contribution of males to the determination of offspring sex. Most available studies, conducted on samples from domestic boar <sup>4</sup>, domestic cattle <sup>4-8</sup> or humans <sup>9-11</sup>, used inaccurate evaluation techniques such as fluorescence staining of the F-body or PCR amplification on pooled semen samples. A positive correlation between the ratio in the ejaculate and the birth sex ratio was found in those few studies which evaluated both parameters <sup>6,10,11</sup>. The few studies that were based on the more accurate fluorescence _in situ_ hybridisation \\(FISH) evaluation technique <sup>12-14</sup> either suffered from a considerably smaller sample size compared to their control \\(176 samples compared to the pooled national data on birth sex ratio from several European countries and the USA) and counted too few cells to detect a deviation from an even sex ratio \\(only 200 cells per ejaculate) <sup>12</sup>, dealt with samples obtained from infertile patients \\(where actually an excess of X-chromosome bearing spermatozoa was detected) <sup>13</sup>, or had insufficient statistical power and a sample size too small to detect significant deviation from unity \\(N = 7 compared with N = 12) <sup>14</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHere we describe here a detailed protocol for determining the ratio between the X- and Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoa in the ejaculates of the pygmy hippopotamus."

Prepare fresh Carnoy\u2019s fixative and put in the freezer \\(at -18\u00baC to -20\u00baC) for at least 2-3 hours. Keep the fixative in the freezer throughout the handling of the sample.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Procedure:**\r\n\n\n1. Centrifuge native sperm sample of \\(ideally) 200 \u00d7 10\n6\nspermatozoa at 400 g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\r\n  2. Add 8 mL of Carnoy\u2019s fixative, re-suspend the pellet by vortex and then centrifuge at 400 g for 10 minutes. If there is a smaller number of cells \\(50 to 100 \u00d7 10\n6\n) then use only 4 mL of Carnoy\u2019s fixative.\r\n  3. Remove supernatant, suspend again in fixative and centrifuge. Repeat these washing steps 3-4 times \\(or more).\r\n  4. Keep sperm in fixative in the freezer \\(at -18\u00baC to -20\u00baC) until used for slides. Prepare slides on the day the FISH is being done.\r\n  5. Prepare the slides \u2013 make sure they are clean and properly marked on the frosted end.\r\n  6. Vortex the sample before use.\r\n  7. With a disposable plastic pipette drop \\(from about 10 cm above the slide) one drop of suspended semen on each slide and air-dry them horizontally.\r\n  8. Mark the area of the drop on the backside of the slide with diamond pen.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**B. Slide treatment \\(bloating, aging, denaturation, hybridization)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Before starting**\r\n\n\n1. Thaw one 2-mL Eppendorf of 0.1 M Tris solution and one 20-\u00b5L tube of DTT solution for every 4-5 slides.\r\n  2. Thaw 100 \u00b5L of 70% formamid solution for each slide.\r\n  3. Put about 120 mL of 2\u00d7 SSC solution in a Coplin jar at room temperature.\r\n  4. Put about 120 mL of distilled water inside a Coplin jar in the refrigerator at 4\u00baC.\r\n  5. Thaw hybridisation mix. For each slide mix about 4 \u03bcL of hybridisation mix with 0.5 \u00b5L of each of the X and Y chromosome-specific probes. Make sure to vortex the probes before taking the needed volume. Keep in ice in the dark or in the freezer \\(at -18\u00baC to -20\u00baC) until just before use. Vortex before use.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Procedure:**\r\n\n\n1. Mix well the DTT with the 0.1 M Tris solution \\(one Eppendorf of each), resulting in 10 mM DTT solution. Make sure to take all the DTT by washing the DTT tube several times with 0.1 M Tris solution taken from the other tube.\r\n  2. Put 0.4 to 0.5 mL of the 10 mM DTT solution on each slide, spread it evenly, cover with parafilm and leave at room temperature for 15 min.\r\n  3. Remove parafilm, discard access of liquid and then wash for 2 min in 2\u00d7 SSC solution at room temperature.\r\n  4. Air dry the slides.\r\n  5. Put 100 \u00b5L of 70% formamid solution on each slide, cover with large \\(24 \u00d7 50 mm) cover slip while making sure the liquid spreads all over the slide \\(with no air bubbles).\r\n  6. Pre-heat the ThermoBrite to 80\u00baC, load the slides and incubate for 10 min. If do not fill all slots on the ThermoBrite with samples then put empty slides in the empty slots.\r\n  7. Remove the slides from the ThermoBrite, remove the cover slips, discard of excess liquids and then wash in the cold distilled water for two minutes.\r\n  8. Air dry the slides.\r\n  9. Dehydrate the slides in the ethanol solutions - 1 min in each concentration going from 70% to 90% to 100% and then air-dry the slides.\r\n   Make sure the slides are absolutely dry before going to next step\\!\\!\r\n\n\n10. Put on each 20 \u00d7 20 mm cover slip, at its center, 5 \u03bcL of probes with hybridization mix. Put the slide over the cover slip \\(face down) so the marked area aligns with the cover slip and let it stand for about one minute to let the hybridization and probes mix spread evenly. Make sure the entire area is covered and that no air bubbles are left. If needed, apply light pressure to spread the mix all the way to the edges of the cover slip.\r\n  11. Seal around with rubber cement.\r\n  12. Put in the ThermoBrite with some distilled water for humidity and run the following program: 10 minutes at 65\u00baC for denaturation and then at 37\u00baC over night for hybridization.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**C. Washing and counter staining**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Before starting**\r\n\n\n1. Heat water bath to 75\u00baC and put 120 mL of 0.4\u00d7 SSC solution in a Coplin jar in it for at least two hours.\r\n  2. Put 120 mL of 2\u00d7 SSC / 0.1% NP-40 solution in a Coplin jar at room temperature.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Procedure:**\r\n\n\n1. Remove rubber cement and cover slip.\r\n  2. Put for 1 minute in 0.4 SSC at 75\u00baC.\r\n  3. Drip excess solution and then put for 1 min in 2\u00d7 SSC / 0.1% NP-40 at room temperature.\r\n  4. Air dry the slides in the dark.\r\n  5. Put a drop of DAPI with antifade \\(about 22 \u00b5L per slide) and cover with a 24 \u00d7 32 mm cover slip.\r\n  6. If intended for prolonged storage, seal around the edges of the cover slip with nail polish and then air dry it. Slides should be stored in the freezer \\(at -18\u00baC to -20\u00baC).\r\n  7. View under fluorescence microscope at \u00d7100 magnification with oil. The microscope should have a three-way filter \u2013 One for DAPI \\(blue), one for Cy3 \\(red) and one for FITC \\(green).\r\n  8. IF successful, all cells will be stained blue, X-chromosome bearing spermatozoa should have red/pink spot on them and Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoa should have a green/yellow spot on them."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Pre-determining fetal sex is against the random, equal opportunity both conceptus sexes have by nature. Yet, under a wide variety of circumstances, populations shift their birth sex ratio from the expected unity. The prevailing assumption has been that males produce approximately equal numbers of X and Y chromosome bearing spermatozoa in large quantities and that they have no say in this regard. However, males seem to be able to manipulate the sex ratio of their ejaculates. Here we describe a protocol for fluorescence _in situ_ hybridisation that can help evaluate the ratio between spermatozoa carrying either of the two sex chromosomes in the ejaculate, and determine the male\u2019s contribution to the sexual conflict. We also discuss the benefits and shortcomings of the technique. The protocol can be completed within 31 h, 20 of which are hybridisation time. Although this protocol has been devised for the pygmy hippopotamus \\(_Choeropsis liberiensis_), with minor modifications and a change of probes it can be adapted to other species as well.",
