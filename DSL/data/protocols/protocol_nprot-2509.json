            "content": "The development of a robust, rapid and highly-sensitive immunoassay format for the precise detection of HFA is an absolute requirement for clinical disease diagnosis. HFA is a highly specific biomarker for atherosclerosis<sup>1</sup> and hepatocellular carcinoma<sup>2</sup>, which is also involved in diabetes<sup>3</sup>, cardiovascular diseases<sup>4</sup>, arthritis, metabolism-associated syndrome<sup>5</sup>, and malaria<sup>6</sup>. It is a liver-derived protein that is secreted into the bloodstream in the concentration range of 450-600 \u00b5g/mL. The concentration of HFA changes significantly in various pathophysiological conditions<sup>1,7-9</sup>. \r\n\n\n    Several immunoassay formats have been developed till date for HFA detection, which were mainly based on ELISA<sup>10-11</sup>, surface plasmon resonance \\(SPR)<sup>12</sup>, microarray<sup>13</sup>, and electrochemical luminescence<sup>6</sup>. However, ELISA is still the most widely used format and the accepted clinical standard for HFA detection. But in recent years, several highly-sensitive chemiluminescent substrates, having wide detection range and improved analytical sensitivity, have been developed<sup>14</sup>. The developed CIA<sup>15</sup>, being the most sensitive immunoassay format for HFA detection in comparison to ELISA and SPR, can have potential applications in clinical diagnostics.\r\n\n\nAPTES has been widely used for the leach-proof immobilization of biomolecules<sup>16-19</sup> as it enables high immobilization density, long-term stability, high reproducibility, and less biofouling. It has been extensively employed for the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems<sup>20-22</sup>. In the present study, the covalent crosslinking of antibodies in a leach-proof manner on APTES-functionalized bioanalytical platform leads to higher functional antibody immobilization density that results in highly sensitive analyte detection."

            "content": "The developed CIA detected HFA in the range of 0.3 pg/mL -20 ng/mL \\(Figure 2A) with linearity from 2.5-312.5 ng/mL. The limit of detection \\(LOD) and analytical sensitivity were 0.3 pg/mL and 5 pg/mL, respectively. The various experimental controls demonstrated the highly specific detection of HFA and non-interference of BSA with any of the assay components \\(Figure 2B). The inter- and intra-day variability were in the range of 2.1-6.3 % and 3-8.2 %, respectively, while the half-effective concentration \\(EC50) was 52 pg/mL. The intra- and inter-day variability were calculated from five assay repeats \\(in triplicate) on a single and five different days, respectively. \r\n\n\n    The developed HFA CIA significantly decreased the overall assay duration by more than 3-fold i.e. from 20 h \\(commercial HFA sandwich ELISA) to about 5.5 h. It has better analytical performance as its analytical sensitivity \\(5 pg/mL) was 125-fold better than that of the commercial HFA ELISA \\(625 pg/mL). Moreover, it has lower limit of detection \\(LOD) with better analytical sensitivity in comparison to our previously developed HFA immunoassay formats based on surface plasmon resonance \\(SPR)<sup>12</sup> and sandwich ELISA<sup>10-11</sup>. The higher sensitivity of CIA is mainly due to the high functional antibody immobilization density on APTES-functionalized MTP and the higher sensitivity of chemiluminescent substrate \\(luminol/enhancer and stable peroxide solution). The enhancer in chemiluminescent substrate<sup>14</sup> results in rapid and highly intensified signal for a longer time, which enables wider detection range and low background. \r\n\n\n    The anti-HFA antibody-bound MTPs can be effectively stored at 4\u00b0C in 0.1 M PBS for many weeks without any significant decrease in functional activity<sup>15</sup>, which is useful for rapid analyte detection in mass-use applications such as clinical diagnosis. However, as the developed procedure takes only 1.5 h for antibody immobilization, it will completely obviate the need of storing antibody-bound MTPs in industries, where they are usually stored for about two weeks.  \r\n\n\n    Our previously developed modified MTP format<sup>23</sup>, which was specifically designed to perform immunoassays on different substrate platforms, was employed to demonstrate the multisubstrate-compatibility of developed HFA CIA that was mainly due to the generic nature of APTES-functionalization step. Various commercially-relevant substrates, i.e. PS, PC, PMMA, CA, Zeonex\u2122 and Zeonor\u2122, were used as they are being employed extensively for various biosensors, diagnostics, lab-on-a-chip technologies, and other bioanalytical applications \\(Figure 3)."

It has more than 3-fold reduced overall assay duration than the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA). Moreover, it has a wide detection range i.e. 0.3 pg/mL-20 ng/mL and 125-fold better analytical sensitivity than the commercial ELISA kit. The anti-HFA antibody-bound MTPs can be effectively stored in 0.1M PBS without any significant loss of functional activity. The developed HFA CIA is multisubstrate-compatible and can be employed for immunoassays on a wide range of commercially-relevant substrates that are being used in various biosensors/point-of-care diagnostics.",
