Design single-stranded DNA \\(ssDNA) custom primer sequences complementary to regions of interest with 5\u2019 phosphate modification added. Also design complementary splint sequences that also carry a 8-12 bp overhang of A-repeats. \r\n\n\nc. Resuspend all oligos in Tris-EDTA \\(TE) buffer at a concentration of 500 \u03bcM.\r\n\n\nd. Mix equal volumes \\(20 \u03bcL) of the custom primer and splint oligos in the presence of 50 mM NaCl and transfer to PCR striptube. Heat the reaction mixture to 95 \u00b0C and cool to 14 \u00b0C at a slow rate \\(-0.1 \u00b0C/s).  This will create the double stranded toehold probes for ligation to beads. \r\n\n\ne. Dilute each toehold probes with TE buffer to obtain a final concentration of 100 \u03bcM. \r\n\n\nf. Mix toehold probes in desired ratio and dilute the mixture to obtain the desired final probe concentration \\(for DART-seq experiments the all toehold probes were mixed in equal proportions). \r\n\n\ng. Combine 16 \u03bcL of this pooled probe mixture with 40 \u03bcL of PEG-4000 \\(50% w/v), 40 \u03bcL of T4 DNA ligase buffer, 72 \u03bcL of water, and 2 \u03bcL of T4 DNA Ligase. \r\n\n\nh. Combine 12,000 beads with the above ligation mix and incubate for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C \\(15 second alternative mixing at 1800 rpm). It is very important to keep beads suspended during ligation; failure to do so will lead to coverage heterogeneities.\r\n\n\ni. Inactivate enzyme by heating the reaction mix at 65 \u00b0C for 3 minutes \r\n\n\nj. Quench reaction mixture by placing in ice water for at least 1 minute. \r\n\n\nk. To obtain the desired quantity of DART-seq primer beads, perform 6-10 bead ligation reactions in parallel. Pool all reactions and wash beads once with 250 \u03bcL Tris-EDTA Sodium dodecyl sulfate \\(TE-SDS) buffer, and twice with Tris-EDTA-Tween 20 \\(TE-TW) buffer. \r\n\n\nk. DART-seq primer beads can be stored in TE-TW at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\nl.

Set water bath/stir plate unit to 35\u00b0C.\r\n\n\nc. Count murine L929 cells and pellet 4 x 106 cells per 50 ml tube \\(2 tubes) at 215 x g, for 10 min in table top centrifuge.\r\n\n\nd. Re-suspend one pellet of cells in 1 mL of CMEM as the Mock and the other pellet in 1 mL DMEM media for infection. Dilute 10 \u00b5l purified virus in 90 \u00b5l PBS to add Multiplicity of infection of 10 to the tube of cells to infect.\r\n\n\ne. Bind virus for 1 hour, mixing gently every 12 minutes.\r\n\n\nf. Add a stir bar and 150 mL CMEM to 2 x 500 ml flat bottomed culture flasks. The flat surface allows better stirring. \r\n\n\ng. After 1 hour binding, add the cells to their designated bottles. Use a weighted ring to keep bottles from tipping over. Center the bottles so that stir-bar moves smoothly without hitting the sides of the bottle. Stir at 190 rpm for 15 hours at 35\u00b0C.\r\n\n\nh. Collect suspensions into 2 x 250 mL conical bottles.\r\n\n\ni. Pellet cells at 1400  x g for 10 minutes in Sorval centrifuge.\r\n\n\nj. Resuspend pellets in PBS containing 0.01% BSA and put on ice.\r\n\n\nk. Perform two additional washes followed by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 8 min, and then resuspend cells in the same buffer at a final concentration of 300,000 cells/mL. \r\n\n\n2.2 Cell preparation for human B cell and PBMC DART-seq experiment\r\n\n\na. Cells can be obtained from Zen-Bio. Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells,\r\n\n\nCryopreserved, 15 million cells/vial \\(SER-PBMC-F), and Normal Human Peripheral Blood B-Cells, CD19+, Cryopreserved, 1 million cells/vial \\(SER-CD19-F).\r\n\n\nb. Wash cells three times with PBS containing 0.01% BSA, each wash followed by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and then resuspend in the same buffer. \r\n\n\nc. Filter cell suspension through a 40 \u03bcm filter and resuspended to a final concentration of 120,000 cells/mL.\r\n\n\n2.3 Cell preparation for bulk qPCR assays\r\n\n\na. Pellet cells by centrifugation \\(condition varies based on the type of cells).\r\n\n\nb. Wash pellet twice with cold PBS containing 0.01% BSA.\r\n\n\nc. Add 1 mL of lysis buffer to the cell pellet and incubate at 4\u00b0C for 15 min with occasional vortexing.\r\n\n\nd. Centrifuge lysate at 4\u00b0C for 14000 rpm for 15 min.\r\n\n\nf. Take supernatant and add to hybridize to beads with gentle rolling at room temperature for 15 min.\r\n\n\ng. Wash beads once with TE-SDS and twice with TE-TW and continue with RT \\(Section 4, step i).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Microfluidics set up\r\n  a. Load the cell and barcoded bead suspension into 3 mL syringes \\(BD Scientific, Cat # BD309695) and connect to the microfluidic chip via 26G1/2 sterile needles \\(BD Scientific, Cat # BD305111) and PE2 tubing \\(Scientific Commodities, Inc. Cat # BB31695-PE/2). Note that the bead syringe is loaded onto the syringe pump in an upside down position, along with a flea magnet inside the syringe and constant stirring, using external magnetic stirrer. Flow both bead and nuclei suspensions at 4000 uL/hr each, along with carrier oil \\(BioRad Sciences, Cat # 186-4006) loaded in 10 mL syringes \\(BD Scientific, Cat # BD309695) and flown at 15 mL/hr to co-encapsulate cells and beads in droplets.\r\n\n\nb. Collect resulting emulsion via PE2 tubing into a 50 mL Falcon tube.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. cDNA Library Preparation\r\n  a. Emulsion collected after microfluidic co-encapsulation has the droplets at the top with clear oil collected under the droplets. Carefully remove the excess clear oil, add 30 mL of 6x SSC \\(Teknova, Inc., Cat # S0282) into each 50 ml Falcon collection tube, add 1 mL of 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctan-1-ol \\(Sigma, Cat # 45-370533-25G-EA) and shake vigorously up and down 4-5 times. It is recommended that all washes following this step be performed and the beads temporarily stored on ice. \r\n\n\nb. Centrifuge falcon tube at 1,000 x g for 1 min. \r\n\n\nc. Carefully remove the supernatant from each tube and pipette an additional 30 ml of 6x SSC to kick up the beads from the oil-water interface into the aqueous phase. \r\n\n\nd. Remove the beads that were kicked up immediately into the SSC with a 25 ml pipette and transfer them into a clean 50 ml Falcon tube, leaving the heavier oil behind. \r\n\n\ne. Centrifuge the newly transferred beads and SSC mix again at 1,000 x g for 1 min; carefully remove the supernatant leaving ~1 ml of SSC and bead sediment behind. \r\n\n\nf. Carefully transfer remaining SSC and bead mix into a 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube and spin it down on a desktop micro-centrifuge for ~10 sec to generate a noticeable bead pellet. \r\n\n\ng. Remove any residual oil that got transferred into the 1.5 ml tube with a p200 pipette with low-retention pipette tip. \r\n\n\nh. Wash the beads again in 1.5 mL of 6x SSC and then again in 300 \u00b5l of 5x Maxima H- RT buffer \\(ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat # EP0753). A pellet of barcoded beads in each micro-centrifuge tube should have ~130,000 beads. \r\n\n\ni.

DART-seq  allows  simultaneous  multiplexed  amplicon  sequencing  and  transcriptome  analysis  in  single  cells.  Using  a  simple  and  quick  modification  of  commercially  available  barcoded  beads  we  have  expanded  the  application  of  droplet  microfluidics  based  high  throughput  single  cell  RNA  sequencing  technology  to  include  non-polyadenylated  RNA  transcripts.  Specific  probes  targeting  RNA  of  interest  were  attached  to  the  beads  using  a  T4  DNA  Ligase  based  enzymatic  reaction.The  modified  DART-seq  beads  were  then  used  in  standard  Drop-seq platform  to  generate  single  cell  libraries  for  sequencing.  We  have  applied  DART-seq  to  analyze  reovirus  RNA  sequences  in  infected  murine  L  cells.  As  a  second  application  we  used  DART-seq  to  investigate  the  B  cell  repertoire  in  human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cell  \\(PBMC)  samples.",
