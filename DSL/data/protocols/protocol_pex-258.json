Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\n1.4) Heparin\nThe concentration used here is measured in mg/ml, however the manufacturer reports quantity in units. The potency (units/mg) is lot-specific; the value can be found on the certificate of analysis (it is typically over 140 units per mg). The number of mg required is calculated by dividing the number of units of the batch by the potency in units per mg. Reconstitute the batch in the volume of water needed to make a 10 mg/mL stock solution. Reconstituted solutions can be stored at 2-8\u00b0C for up to 2 years, if sterile filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter.\n2) Media preparation\n2.1) Cortical Differentiation Medium I - CDM I [Day 0-18] (quantity per 100 mL medium)\nGlasgow MEM, G-MEM (77 mL)\nKnockOut Serum Replacement (20 mL - final 20%)\nMEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution (1 mL)\nSodium pyruvate (1 mL)\n2-mercaptoethanol (182 \u03bcL of 55 mM stock - final 0.1 mM)\nPenicillin/Streptomycin Solution (1 mL)\n2.2) Cortical Differentiation Medium II - CDM II [Day 18-35] (quantity per 100 mL medium)\nDMEM/F-12 (96 mL)\nGlutaMAX Supplement (1 mL)\nN-2 Supplement (1 mL)\nChemically Defined Lipid Concentrate (1 mL)\nFungizone (100 \u03bcL of 250 \u03bcg/ml stock - final 0.25 \u03bcg/mL)\nPenicillin/Streptomycin Solution (1 mL)\n2.3) Cortical Differentiation Medium III - CDM III [Day 35-70] (quantity per ~200 mL medium)\nDMEM/F-12 (170 mL)\nHyclone Fetal Bovine Serum (20 mL - final 10%)\nChemically Defined Lipid Concentrate (2 mL)\nGlutaMAX Supplement (2 mL)\nN-2 Supplement (2 mL)\nHeparin (100uL of 10mg/mL - final 5 \u03bcg/mL)\nFungizone (200 \u03bcL of 250 \u03bcg/mL stock - final 0.25 \u03bcg/mL)\nPenicillin/Streptomycin Solution (2 mL)\nMatrigel (2 mL - final 1%)\n2.4) Cortical Differentiation Medium IV - CDM IV [Day 70 on] (quantity per ~200 mL medium)\nDMEM/F-12 (166 mL)\nHyclone Fetal Bovine Serum (20 mL - final 10%)\nChemically Defined Lipid Concentrate (2 mL)\nGlutaMAX Supplement (2 mL)\nN-2 Supplement (2 mL)\nB-27 Supplement (4 mL)\nHeparin (100uL of 10mg/mL stock - 5 \u03bcg/mL)\nFungizone (200 \u03bcL of 250 \u03bcg/L stock - final 0.25 \u03bcg/mL)\nPenicillin/Streptomycin Solution (2 mL)\nMatrigel (4 mL - final 2%)\nGeneration of reproducible human brain organoids\nMaintenance of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)\nMaintain feeder-free hPSCs on TC-treated cell culture dishes pre-coated with Geltrex, in mTESR1 medium with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, in a humidified incubator at 37\u02daC and 5% CO\n2\n.\nDetailed protocol for thawing, maintenance, and passaging of hPSCs can be found in Arlotta\net al.\n, 2017\n[5]\n.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CRITICAL STEP: It is recommended to routinely confirm karyotype stability (suggested: every 5 passages) and make sure that stem cells are mycoplasma-free (on a weekly basis). MycoAlert PLUS Mycoplasma Detection Kit can be used to detect mycoplasma contamination. Single-cell dissociation should be avoided during passaging. The use of non-enzymatic methods to detach cell clumps, for instance Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent, is recommended.\nDay 0 -\nCell aggregate formation in CDM I Media\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start with hPSCs\u00a0that are 80-90% confluent.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CRITICAL STEP: For the generation of brain organoids, it is recommended to use healthy viable hPSCs (mycoplasma-free, karyotypically normal and below passage 50) with typical morphological features of pluripotent cells (tightly packed colonies of round cells with large nuclei and nucleoli), with no sign of differentiation. Optimal stem cell culture practice and attention to details are essential requirements for the formation of healthy dorsal forebrain organoids.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Before starting cell dissociation, prepare the following mix\n(Seeding Medium)\n:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CDM I (10 mL)\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ROCK inhibitor\n[6]\n(40 \u03bcL of 5 mM stock - final 20 \u03bcM)\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IWR1 (1 \u03bcL of 30 mM stock - 3 \u03bcM)\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SB 431542 (5 \u03bcL of 10 mM stock \u2013 final 5 \u03bcM - final 5 \u03bcM)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash the cells with PBS.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Add Accutase to the dish and incubate for approximately 4-5 minutes at 37\u02daC.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CRITICAL STEP: Different incubation times may be required depending on cell confluence or for different hPSCs.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use a 1 mL pipette to dissociate the cells.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CRITICAL STEP: Avoid rough pipetting to prevent damage to cells, which can lead to cell death.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add mTESR1 to dilute the Accutase suspension containing the dissociated cells and transfer content to a 15 mL conical tube.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge the cells.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in\nCDM I\n.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge the cells.\n10.\u00a0Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1mL of\nCDM I\n.\n11.\u00a0Count the cells.\n12.\u00a0Dilute the proper volume of cell suspension (containing 900,000 cells) from\nStep 10\ninto 10 mL of\nSeeding Medium.\n13.

Gently transfer each organoid to an individual 60 mm dish.\n4. Carefully aspirate excess media and add 2.5 mL of Papain + DNase solution to the 60 mm dish.\n5. Using a new, sterile razor blade, mince organoids into small pieces (< 1 mm).\n6. Transfer the plate to an orbital shaker at 70 rpm inside a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\nfor 30 minutes.\n7. Use a 1 mL pipette to gently dissociate and break up minced pieces.\n8. Return the plate to the orbital shaker using the same conditions as\nStep 6\nfor 10 more minutes.\n9. During this time, add 5 mL of Earle\u2019s medium plus 3 mL of reconstituted Inhibitor solution to a 15 mL conical tube (prepare 1 tube per organoid).\n10. Using a 10 mL pipette, gently pipette the minced pieces up-and-down 10 times.\n11. Transfer the entire volume to an empty 15 mL conical tube and wait for the debris to settle (1-3 minutes).\n12. Transfer the cell suspension (avoiding debris) to the tube prepared in\nStep 9\n.\n13. Invert the tube a few times to mix.\n14. Centrifuge the cells at 300\ng\nfor 7 minutes.\n15. Aspirate the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cells in 500-1,000 \u03bcL of 1x PBS.\n16.\u00a0Filter the resuspended cells.\n17. Dilute and count the cells.\n18. Resuspend the cells at 1,000 cells/\u03bcL.\n19. Add BSA to a final concentration of 0.04%."

On Day 0, dissociated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are seeded in CDM I medium containing TGF-\u03b2 and WNT inhibitors (TGF-\u03b2i, WNTi), into V-bottom 96-well plates to allow embryoid body (EB) formation. ROCK inhibitor is added from day 0 to day 6 to increase single cell survival. On Day 18, EBs are transferred to 100 mm ultra-low attachment dishes in CDM II medium. From day 35, EBs are cultured in spinner flasks containing CDM III medium, and from Day 70, CDM III is replaced with CDM IV. CDM, Cortical Differentiation Medium. Bottom, bright field images of EBs and organoids derived from the iPSC 11a line. EBs at Day 3, 9, 18, 27 and 35 were imaged by using an EVOS FL microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific; scale bar: 400uM); organoids at day 90, by using a SMZ1500 stereoscope (Nikon; scale bar: 2mm); and organoids at 180, by using a M60 stereoscope (Leica; scale bar: 2mm).",

Several protocols to generate brain organoids have been described in recent years<sup>[1, 2]</sup>. However, incomplete characterization and lack of organoid-to-organoid reproducibility has limited their application as an experimental model<sup>[3]</sup>. Here we describe a detailed protocol for the generation of human dorsal forebrain organoids that show highly reproducible generation of the rich diversity of cell types present in the developing human cerebral cortex. This protocol is a modification of a previous method described by Kadoshima <em>et al</em>.<sup>[4]</sup>. We also include a detailed description of the protocol used to dissociate organoids into single cells for single-cell RNA-sequencing.</p><p><br></p>",
