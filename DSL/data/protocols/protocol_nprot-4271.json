            "content": "Each human kidney comprises maximally 2 million nephrons and is responsible for blood filtration, the regulation of pH and electrolyte and fluid balance. As there is no postnatal nephron progenitor cell in the kidney, nephrons are never renewed spontaneously once they are lost or severely damaged. Therefore, there is an urgent need for renal regenerative strategies for generating kidney tissues artificially. One feasible approach is recreating the kidney via the directed differentiation of hPSCs. Considering that hPSCs represent a primed pluripotent state and are equivalent to epiblast stem cells, it is required to recapitulate the developmental steps via the posterior primitive streak \\(PS) and the intermediate mesoderm \\(IM) to induce kidney progenitor cells from hPSCs. The posterior PS is the progenitor population for the mesoderm such as the IM, and can be induced from hPSCs using CHIR99021<sup>1</sup>. The IM differentiates into two key kidney progenitor populations: the ureteric epithelium \\(UE), the progenitor of collecting ducts, and the metanehpric mesenchyme \\(MM), the progenitor of nephrons. While the anterior IM gives rise to UE, the posterior IM develops to the MM<sup>2-4</sup>. Here, we present a method to induce both the anterior and posterior IM at the same time by the carefully determined period of using CHIR99021. This simultaneous induction leads the successful generation of kidney organoids containing all anticipated renal components including nephrons, interstitia and endothelia."

The protocol consists of 2 phases: 7 days of monolayer culture and a subsequent 11 to 18 days of 3D culture in a pellet. End products are kidney organoids comprising segmented nephrons, including the collecting duct, distal tubule, proximal tubule and glomerulus, surrounded by renal interstitial and endothelial cells.",
