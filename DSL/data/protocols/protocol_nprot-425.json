            "content": "We developed a strategy to purify a small cell population from the Drosophila ovary for the purpose of gene expression profiling \\(used in Wang et al, 2006b).  The Drosophila ovary is comprised of ovarioles, which are strings of egg chambers at successively later stages of development.   Within each egg chamber, there are 16 large germ line cells encompassed by about 650 somatic epithelial follicle cells.  Of this set of epithelial cells, some cells will take on specialized fates, such as the border cells.  The border cells are a cluster of 6-8 cells that detach from the epithelium and actively migrate, as part of their normal development.  Once they reach their target, a second population of follicle cells, centripetal cells, initiate migration.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe were interested in the gene expression profiles that distinguish the migratory border and centripetal cells from the non-motile somatic cells and the germ line cells they invade, since ample evidence suggested that changes in transcription play a major role in promoting border cell migration.  As they comprise less than 1% of the cells in the developing egg chamber, the migratory population first had to be purified.   While fluorescence activated cell sorting \\(FACS) is commonly used for this purpose, we found this approach to be inconvenient and gravely damaging to the cells.  Therefore we developed a magnetic bead-based cell purification method \\(Figure 1A).  Flies expressing the transcriptional activator GAL4 in the cells of interest were crossed to flies bearing the UAS-mCD8-GFP transgene, which leads to GAL4-dependent expression of a fusion protein \\(mCD8-GFP) composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the mouse CD8 antigen \\(mCD8) fused to GFP \\(Lee and Luo, 1999).  Ovaries were dissected from female progeny carrying both transgenes and dissociated with protease treatment.  We captured the migratory cell population using commercially available anti-mCD8-antibody-coated magnetic beads and a magnetic separation column.  We recovered viable cells enriched up to 100 fold for the GFP-positive population.  In principle, this purification method can be generalized to other cell types in the fly or to other organisms.  The protocol goes on to describe the use of RNA isolated from these cells to determine gene expression profiles by microarray analysis.  We also compared the expression profiles of cells from wild-type and specific mutant strains to identify target genes of critical transcription factors required for border cell migration."

Keep the total time for dissection to less than two hours.  As shown in Figure 1B-C, the mCD8-GFP+ population represents a small fraction of all the cells in the dissected tissue. Recently we have found that egg chambers survive and border cells migrate at 25\u00b0C, but when put at 4\u00b0C, they retract protrusions \\(M.M. and D.J.M., unpublished).  We do not know if gene expression patterns are altered as a function of temperature but it may be just as good, or even better, to keep the egg chambers at room temperature during the dissection, rather than putting them on ice.  This needs to be determined empirically.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Cell dissociation**: \r\n\n\n1| Reconstitute elastase in cell dissociation buffer at a concentration of 4mg/ml.  This solution can be stored in aliquots at \u201320\u00b0C, but multiple freeze-thaws should be avoided.  Prior to the experimental sample, the elastase solution should be tested \\(see Critical step).  \r\n\n\n2| Collect about 100 ovary pairs in a 1.5ml centrifuge tube, wash with cell dissociation buffer three times and digest with 1ml of elastase solution.  \r\n\n\n3| During digestion, incubate tubes at room temperature and either agitate by inverting by hand, or place the tubes on a stir-plate standing on their caps, and mix with a micro-stir bar that fits into the tube cap.  Agitation is important to dissociate the tissue fully.  \r\n\n\n4| Add 0.5 ml of supplemented Grace\u2019s medium, and transfer the supernatant to a new tube \\(2 times). \r\n\n\n5| Centrifuge dissociated cells at 1000g for 5 minutes at 4\u00baC. \r\n\n\n6| Resuspend pelleted cells in supplemented Grace\u2019s media or PBS buffer + 0.5% BSA for sorting.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Cell purification**: \r\n\n\nFilter the dissociated cells using Filcon 50\u00b5m filters to remove clumps and then subject to magnetic cell purification with magnetic beads coupled with anti-mouse CD8 antibody \\(MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, \"http://www.miltenyibiotec.com\":http://www.miltenyibiotec.com) according to the manufacturer\u2019s manual.  Briefly: \r\n\n\n1| Centrifuge filtered cells at 1000g for 5 minutes at 4\u00baC, resuspend in 90 \u03bcl of buffer per 10-20 ovary pairs, then add 10 \u03bcl of MACS CD8a microbeads, and incubate tubes in a refrigerator \\(8-12\u00baC) for 15 minutes.  \r\n\n\n2| Wash the cells bound to the beads in 1ml of buffer, spin down, and resuspend in 250 \u00b5l of buffer.  Meanwhile, place a positive selection column in the magnetic field of the MACS separator and equilibrate it with 500 \u03bcl filtered buffer.  \r\n\n\n3| Apply 500 \u03bcl of cell suspension in buffer to the pre-filter over the column.  After the cell solution passes through \\(keep the flow-through in two tubes as the CD8- control), wash the column three times with 500 \u03bcl buffer.  \r\n\n\n4| Remove the column from the MACS separator, place it over a 5ml collection tube, and add 1 ml of buffer.  To collect the CD8 positive cell fraction, flush out the column with the supplied plunger.  \r\n\n\n5| For RNA preparation, spin down the cells, take off the supernatant, and proceed to the next section.  Alternatively, the cell pellets can be frozen at this point for later RNA isolation.  An overview of the ovary dissection, cell dissociation and cell purification procedure is shown schematically in Figure 1A.  A sample of purified cells is shown in Figure 1F-I.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**cRNA probe labeling and hybridization**: \r\n\n\n1| Prepare total RNA from purified cells as directed in the Qiagen RNeasy protocol or equivalent protocol.   As a starting point, use 80 \u03bcl RLT buffer for lysis of the positive cell fraction, and 160 \u03bcl buffer for the negative cells.  For each experiment \\(genotype), isolate RNA independently in triplicate. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2| Large scale or small scale experiments can be carried out, depending on the amount of starting material.  For our initial large scale experiments, 5 \u03bcg of each RNA from _slbo_-Gal4/UAS-mCD8-GFP and UAS-mCD8-GFP / +; _tub_-Gal4/+ flies was used to make cRNA probes following Affymetrix probe labeling instruction \\( \"http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx\":http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx). However, we also had success with small scale experiments, which require much less starting tissue.  30 ovary pairs are sufficient to yield more than 100ng of RNA. For this strategy, isolate 100ng of each RNA from UAS-mCD8-GFP /+; c522/+ and _slbo_-Gal4/UAS-mCD8-GFP and UAS-mCD8-GFP / +; _tub_-Gal4/+ flies  to make cRNA probes by following the protocol Small Sample Target Labeling Assay Version II \\( \"http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx\":http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx).  Briefly, synthesize double-stranded cDNA using Invitrogen Superscript II, then amplify the cRNA pool with the Ambion MEGAScript T7 kit and a second round of cDNA synthesis.  Amplify and label the cRNA using the ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript labeling kit.  Hybridize cRNA probes to Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array as directed, then wash and proceed to signal detection as suggested by Affymetrix.  Each experiment should be repeated three times using independent biological samples.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Variations on the protocol**\r\n\n\nThis protocol can be used to purify any population of cells for which there is a specific GAL4 driver.  In addition, by crossing the GAL4 driver of interest and UAS-mCD8-GFP in mutant backgrounds, the same population of cells can be purified from wild-type and mutant strains.  For example, to identify transcriptional targets of the Slow Border Cells \\(SLBO) transcription factor, one can isolate border cells from _slbo_-Gal4, _slbo\ne7b\n_ / UAS-mCD8-GFP, _slbo\nLy6\n_ flies to compare these loss-of-function mutants to wild type.  As the _slbo_-Gal4 driver also activates expression in the centripetal cells, a different driver may be needed.  We used c522, _slbo\ne7b\n_ / UAS-mCD8-GFP, _slbo\nLy6\n_ to identify SLBO targets that might be specific to the border cells.  As we expected, this method uncovered some known and many new potential target genes for SLBO.  In a similar type of experiment, we sought to identify targets of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.  In this case, we used _slbo_-Gal4, UAS-mCD8-GFP / UAS-UPD because high levels of the activating protein Unpaired \\(UPD) result in hyper-activation of STAT target genes."

                "legend": "A method for purifying a small number of cells from Drosophila ovaries.   A) Schematic of the steps in the cell purification protocol.  Ovaries are first dissected from female flies, and the tissue is dissociated with elastase treatment.  Cells of interest (mCD8-GFP-positive), colored in green, are purified from dissociated ovaries by their affinity to anti-mCD8-antibody, which is linked to magnetic beads.  B-C) Fluorescent micrographs of ovarioles of the genotype _slbo_-Gal4/UAS-mCD8-GFP.  Young egg chambers are to the left and older ones on the right. B) GFP at the cell membranes labels the migratory cell types including the border cells (arrows), and the centripetal cells (arrowheads).  The GFP-positive cells are selected in the purification strategy.  By stage 10 (egg chamber to the right), migration is complete.  C) Staining with Armadillo (Arm, red) antibody clearly labels all of the somatic cells present in the ovariole, of which the migratory cells (green) comprise less than 1%.  The larger, germ-line cells can also be seen within each egg chamber by Arm staining.  D-E) Schematic drawing of ovary dissection.  D) A fattened female fly is held to the bottom of a depression slide, ventral side facing up, under insect cell culture medium using a pair of forceps.  A second pair of forceps is used to pull the tail end of the fly.  E) The ovary pair usually comes out of the abdomen intact using this approach.  The ovary pair can then be transferred to the neighboring well of the depression slide or to a microcentrifuge tube with medium. F-I) Micrographs of purified cells.  Nuclei of all the cells are labeled by Hoechst staining (F, blue in I).  The population is highly enriched for GFP-positive cells (G, green in I), and most survive the treatment intact as assayed by exclusion of propidium iodide (H, red in I). &#x201C;Adapted from Developmental Cell, vol. 10, Wang et al., Analysis of cell migration using whole genome expression profiling of migratory cells in the Drosophila ovary, 483-495 (2006), with permission from Elsevier&#x201D;\r\n\r\nA larger version of this image can be found \"here\":http://protocols.nature.com/image/show/925\r\n\r\n",
