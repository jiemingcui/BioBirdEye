            "content": "Enantioseparation has attracted considerable attention in biological science and pharmaceutical industry because of the different physiological activity and pharmacological effects of different enantiomers1. Amongst many analytical techniques, capillary electrophoresis \\(CE) is a relatively new separation technique that provides rapid analysis with high efficiency and resolution due to the use of electric field and a variety of selective modes2. Cyclodextrins are the most commonly utilized chiral selectors added into the background electrolyte to perform enantioseparation. Besides neutral CDs derivatives, the synthesis and application of charged CDs derivatives have become attractive due to their good water solubility and excellent enantiorecognition abilities towards counter-charged racemic analytes3,4. Previously, our group has developed a series of positive changed single isomer CD selectors which afforded good enantioseparation abilities to anionic and ampholytic acids by CE5,6,7. This protocol describes an example of CE enantioseparation using a recently reported chiral selector mono-6-deoxy-6-\\(3R,4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine)-\u03b2-CD chloride \\(dhypy-CDCl)8."
