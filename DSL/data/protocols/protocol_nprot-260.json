The protocol refers to lysine decarboxylase, but the activity of several other amino acid decarboxylases can be similarly determined."

Start recording in the kinetic mode \\(exc = 336 nm, em = 380 nm).\r\n  3. Add 20 \u00b5l of cucurbituril stock \\(500 \u00b5M) to the solution and wait ca. 2 min until the fluorescence intensity has equilibrated.\r\n  4. Add 50 \u00b5l of lysine stock \\(1 mM) to the solution.\r\n  5. Add 50 \u00b5l of lysine decarboxylase \\(800 \u00b5g/ml) to initiate the reaction and record fluorescence until no change in fluorescence intensity is registered.\r\n  6. Total assay volume is 1 ml. Final concentrations are: 2.5 \u00b5M Dapoxyl, 10 \u00b5M cucurbituril, 50 \u00b5M lysine, 40 \u00b5g/ml lysine decarboxylase.

If the fluorescence increase is very different, check the pH of the buffer.\r\n\n\nAfter step \\(4), the fluorescence should not change by more than 10%. If it changes by a larger amount, check the lysine sample for impurities.\r\n\n\nAfter step \\(5), the fluorescence should decrease first stepwise \\(immediately) and then more slowly with time. If the latter time-resolved fluorescence decay is not observed after 5 min, the enzyme may be inactive.\r\n\n\nIf the stepwise \\(immediate) decrease in fluorescence intensity in step \\(5) is very pronounced \\(we relate this to varying degrees of salts and impurities in the enzyme sample), the sequence of steps \\(4) and \\(5) can be exchanged to obtain visually improved enzyme kinetic traces.
