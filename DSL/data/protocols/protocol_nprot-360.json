            "content": "Apoptotic cells, via the activation of caspases, undergo significant proteome alterations. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by dendritic cells \\(DCs) leads to the processing of the apoptotic cell-associated \\(apoptotic) antigens and the cross-presentation of the resulting peptides on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. This phenomenon seems crucial for inducing either cross-priming or cross-tolerance of CD8+ T cells, based on the presence or absence of various infectious or danger signals influencing the switch from tolerogenic immature DCs \\(iDCs) to mature DCs \\(mDCs) with high stimulatory and migratory capacities.\r\n\n\nHere, we demonstrate the following: \\(a) the protein modifications in apoptotic T cells, as detected by comparing the proteomic profiles of apoptotic and nonapoptotic T cells, generate apoptotic proteins that have antigenic properties with respect to human CD8+ T cells; \\(b) these autoreactive CD8+ T cell responses correlate with the proportion of apoptotic CD4+ T cells in individuals with HIV infection in vivo and contribute to chronic immune activation; and \\(c) the caspase-mediated cleavage of several cellular components during apoptosis facilitates antigen processing and cross-presentation by DCs."

Purify CD8+ T cells from PBMCs by positive selection with anti-CD8 mAb coupled to magnetic beads \\(Miltenyi Biotec). In our hands, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated >99% CD8+ cells in the positively purified population and <5% in the CD8-depleted population. \r\n  3. Derive immature DCs from peripheral monocytes purified by positive selection with anti-CD14 mAb coupled to magnetic beads \\(Miltenyi Biotec). \r\n  4. Culture CD14+ cells for 5 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum \\(FCS), 2 mM glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin \\(Gibco BRL) \\(complete medium), 50 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor \\(GM-CFS) \\(Novartis Pharma), and 1000 U/ml rIL-4. \r\n  5. Isolate fresh myeloid DCs from PBMCs by two magnetic separation steps, in order to previously  deplete B cells from PBMCs with anti-CD19 mAb coupled to magnetic beads, and then positively select CD1c+ DCs using biotin-labeled anti-CD1c mAb and anti-biotin mAb coupled to magnetic beads \\(Miltenyi Biotec). \r\n  6. Obtain mature DCs by a 40-h stimulation of iDCs with CD40L-transfected J558L cells \\(at a DC/J558L ratio of 1:1), as previously described, or with soluble r-CD40L molecules \\(Alexis Biochemicals, Alexis Corporation). The definition of monocyte-derived or myeloid DCs was based on their different surface phenotype profile by staining with anti-CD14, anti-CD86 \\(Caltag Laboratories), anti-CD1a, anti-CD1c, anti-CD11c, anti-CD32, anti-CD80 \\(Becton Dickinson, BD PharMingen) mAbs, Annexin-V \\(ApoAlert Apoptosis Kit, Clontech Laboratories Inc), propidium iodide \\(PI) \\(Sigma-Aldrich), and the appropriate secondary labeled antibodies \\(BD PharMingen) \\(Fig. 1). \r\n  7. After staining, analyse these cells using a FACSCanto flow cytometer \\(Becton Dickinson) and FACSDiva analysis software \\(Becton Dickinson). \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Apoptotic and control cell preparations**. \r\n\n\n1. Plate cloned CD8+CD95+ T cells \\(10-100 x 10\n6\n) in a 24-well plate and incubate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence or absence of 14 \u03bcg/ml caspase 3 inhibitor \\(C3I) \\(Z-DEVD-FMK), C8I \\(Z-IETD-FMK), or a negative caspase control \\(K, Z-FA-FMK) \\(BD Biosciences PharMingen, San Jose, CA, USA), induced to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis as described \\(2). \r\n  2. Induce apoptosis of T cell clones by the addition of 500 ng/ml anti-Fas \\(anti-CD95 mAb \\[clone CH11], Upstate Biotechnology) for at least 6 h \\(2). \r\n  3. Measure apoptosis by Annexin-V \\(ApoAlert Apoptosis Kit, Clontech Laboratories Inc.) and PI \\(Sigma Aldrich) staining and subsequent analysis by flow cytometry. \r\n  4. Purify apoptotoc cells by positive selection using Annexin V-conjugated magnetic microbeads \\(Miltenyi Biotec). As detected by FACS analysis, the positively purified population should consist of >99% Annexin V+ cells.  These will be then used as apoptotic cells in all of the appropriate experiments. \r\n  5. Use as control cells live cloned T cells promptly lysed by repeated freezing and thawing. \r\n  6. Measure spontaneous apoptosis of CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of both HIV-infected and healthy individuals by Annexin-V, PI \\(Sigma Aldrich), and phycoerythrin \\(PE)-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb \\(Caltag) staining of fresh PBMCs before and after 18-h incubation in complete medium at 37\u00b0C. \r\n  7. Use live cloned T cells lysed by repeated freezing and thawing as control. \r\n  8. Measure spontaneous apoptosis of CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of both HIV-infected and healthy individuals by Annexin-V, PI \\(Sigma Aldrich) and phycoerythrin \\(PE)-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb \\(Caltag) staining of fresh PBMCs before and after 18-h incubation in complete medium at 37\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**DC phagocytosis**.\r\n\n\n1. Treat cloned CD8+CD95+ T cells with 14 \u03bcg/ml of caspase 3 inhibitor \\(Z-DEVD-FMK), caspase 3 inhibitor \\(Z-IETD-FMK), or a negative caspase control \\(K, Z-FA-FMK) \\(BD Biosciences PharMingen), dyed green with PKH27 \\(Sigma-Aldrich)\r\n  2. Induce the cells to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis.\r\n  3. Co-culture the apoptotic cells at a 1:1 ratio with iDCs, incubated or not with either rabbit anti-\u03b1v\u03b25 polyclonal antibody \\(Bioline Diagnostici s.r.l.) reacting with a human DC surface integrin implicated in the capture of apoptotic cells \\(3), or the control rabbit Ig, and dyed red with PKH26 \\(Sigma-Aldrich). \r\n  4. After 12 h at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, analyze phagocytosis by flow cytometry, as evidenced by the presence of double-positive cells.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Two-dimensional electrophoresis**. \r\n\n\n1. Collect apoptotic and control cells, wash them twice with phosphate-buffered saline \\(PBS), centrifuge the cells at 1600 rpm for 10 min. \r\n  2.

Perform active sample rehydration into IPG strips at 50 V overnight. \r\n  4. Perform focusing in a Bio-Rad Protean Isoelectric Point Focusing Cell under the following conditions: \\(i) 30 min at 500 V, \\(ii) 30 min at 1000 V, \\(iii) 15 min at 2000 V, \\(iv) 30 min at 3000 V, and \\(v) 7 h at 5000 V.  \r\n  5. After isoelectric point focusing, reduce the IPG strips and alkylate them  with 2% w/v DTT and 2.5% w/v iodoacetamide \\(Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, in 10-min incubations in an  equilibration buffer \\(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% \\[v/v] glycerol, 2% \\[w/v] SDS \\[Sigma-Aldrich]). \r\n  6. To perform the second dimension, mount each strip on an SDS-PAGE gel containing 12% T and 2.5% C \\(w/v) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide \\(Amersham) and then overlayer it with a solution containing 0.5% w/v agarose and 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8.

Excise each 2DE spot of interest and in-gel digest with trypsin, as described \\(4,5). \r\n  2. Carry out MALDI-TOF-MS of tryptic protein hydrolysates and identify proteins from the peptide mass spectra produced by MALDI-TOF-MS using the peptide mass fingerprinting analysis software PeptIdent, accessed via ExPASy \\(http://us.expasy.org). 3. Use the Swiss-Prot database to conduct the searches, allowing for up to one missed cleavage, considering methionine in the oxidized form and cysteine treated with iodoacetamide to form Cys_CAM.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Purification of proteins from 2DE gels**\r\n\n\n1. To extract protein fragments,  transfer 2DE gels onto nitrocellulose membranes electrophoretically \\(Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience, Inc.). \r\n  2.

Quantify the protein contents and separate proteins by SDS-PAGE. \r\n  4. Transfer each gel to a nitrocellulose membrane \\(Schleicher & Schuell), and immunoblot the proteins for vimentin with a relevant guinea pig polyclonal antibody \\(Research Diagnostics Inc.), which recognize both the entire and fragmented vimentin forms \\(see Fig. 2c), and with the secondary horseradish peroxidase \\(HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG antibody \\(Research Diagnostics Inc.). \r\n  5. Perform chemiluminescent detection \\(SuperSignal West PicoChemiluminescent substrate \\[Pierce]) to visualize the resulting proteins.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Caspase 3 digestion and SDS-PAGE of recombinant vimentin**. \r\n\n\n1.
