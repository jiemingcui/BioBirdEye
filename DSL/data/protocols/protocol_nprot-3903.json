            "content": "Ribonucleotides, also known as ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphates \\(rNMPs), which are normally monomers of RNA, have been found to be the most abundant non-canonical nucleotides incorporated into DNA2,3. Sources of ribonucleotide incorporation into DNA include incomplete Okazaki fragment maturation, oxidative damage, and numerous DNA polymerases. Quantitative measures of rNMPs in DNA following alkali treatment of yeast genomic DNA derived from RNase H2-deficient cells estimated ~2,000 rNMPs per genome4,5 while similar measurement conducted for genomic DNA derived from RNase H2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts revealed the presence of more than one million rNMPs in the mouse genome6. Ribonuclease H type 2 \\(RNase H2) is a major protein factor involved in repair of rNMPs in DNA and initiates ribonucleotide excision repair2,3. If not removed, rNMPs have been shown to have both positive roles, such as acting as strand discrimination signal during MMR, and negative consequences, including replication stress and genome instability2,3.\r\n\n\n Despite the numerous studies showing the presence of rNMPs in DNA, information about the distribution and identity of these rNMPs in genomic DNA was unknown till very recently. We developed ribose-seq to capture rNMPs in genomic DNA along with their upstream DNA sequence for library construction, next-generation sequencing, and analysis1. Implementation of ribose-seq to genomic DNA from RNase H2-deficient yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells revealed widespread but non-random distribution of rNMPs in yeast genome, with specific base preferences, neighboring DNA sequence preferences, bias of leading and lagging strand, and hotspots. Ribose-seq allows us to explore rNMP incorporation into DNA potentially in any cell type of any organism and opens up a new direction to better comprehend the impact of rNMPs on genome integrity.\r\n\n\n Here, we detail the steps of ribose-seq library construction as shown in Figure 1. Ribose-seq employs the unique capacity of Arabidopsis thaliana tRNA ligase \\(AtRNL) to ligate 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic monophosphate or 2\u2032-monophosphate termini of DNA and RNA to 5\u2032-monophosphate ends of DNA and RNA7,8. A double-stranded \\(ds) sequencing adaptor, which has both primer sequences for later PCR amplification step, is initially ligated to genomic DNA fragments as AtRNL prefers self-ligation or circularization. Alkali treatment exposes the rNMP-specific 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic monophosphate or 2\u2032-monophosphate termini. Upon ligation by AtRNL, the rNMP is captured along with its upstream DNA sequence while unligated linear single-stranded \\(ss) DNA is degraded with T5 exonuclease. Yeast 2\u2032-phosphotransferase Tpt1 then removes the 2\u2032-monophosphate at the ligation junction, allowing subsequent PCR amplification of the library.\r\n\n\n The details given in this protocol correspond to Illumina library to be sequenced on MiSeq with 50-cycle single-end reads."

Koh et al.1 used S. cerevisiae cells and the protocol \u201cPreparation of Yeast Samples\u201d in the QIAGEN Genomic DNA Handbook.\r\n  3. Use Qubit 2.0 \\(dsDNA HS) to quantify the amount of extracted genomic DNA.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**B. Preparation of ds sequencing adaptor**\r\n\n\n1. Resuspend each of oligonucleotides \\(oligos) Adaptor.L and Adaptor.S in DNase/RNase-free water to a concentration of 50 uM and 500 uM, respectively. \\(All subsequent steps of the protocol use DNase/RNase-free water).\r\n  2. Set up the mixture for annealing Adaptor.L/Adaptor.S as follows:\r\n  \r\n\n\nAnnealing Buffer: 3 uL\r\n\n\n50 uM Adaptor.L: 25 uL\r\n\n\n500 uM Adaptor.S: 12.5 uL\r\n\n\nH\n2\nO: 9.5 uL\r\n\n\nTotal: 50 uL\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5-fold excess of Adaptor.S was added to the mixture to ensure that all Adaptor.L molecules are annealed to Adaptor.S. The remaining single-stranded Adaptor.S will be removed in subsequent purification steps.\r\n\n\n3. Perform annealing by heating the mixture to 95\u2013100 \u00b0C and gradually cooling to room temperature. The resulting ds Adaptor.L/Adaptor.S is at a concentration of 25 uM.\r\n  4. Desalt the mixture by using a spin column. Koh et al.1 used illustra MicroSpin G-25 Column.\r\n  5. Use NanoDrop to quantify the amount of desalted ds Adaptor.L/Adaptor.S. Typically, the yielded concentration ranges from 10 to 13 uM. A concentration of 10 uM will be assumed for subsequent steps of the protocol.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**C. Fragmentation of rNMPs-embedded genomic DNA**\r\n\n\n1. Set up 2 identical reactions of restriction enzyme digestion of genomic DNA as follows \\(for S. cerevisiae genomic DNA as an example):\r\n  \r\n\n\n10X NEBuffer 2: 12 uL\r\n\n\nGenomic DNA: 5 ug \\(x uL)\r\n\n\n20U/uL DraI: 4 uL\r\n\n\n20U/uL EcoRV: 4 uL\r\n\n\n5U/uL SspI: 4 uL\r\n\n\nH\n2\nO: 96-x uL\r\n\n\nTotal: 120 uL\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nGenomic DNA could be digested with a different set of blunt-end resulting restriction enzymes. However, one need to make sure that the restriction sites are well-distributed in the genome and that the digestion results in a population of fragments with an average size of 800\u20131,500 bp.\r\n\n\n2. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C overnight.\r\n  3. Purify the fragmented DNA by using a spin column. Koh et al.1 used the QIAGEN spin column from their PCR Purification Kit. Both reactions can be purified using a single column with elution volume of 30 uL.\r\n  4. Use Qubit 2.0 \\(dsDNA HS) to quantify the amount of fragmented DNA. Typically, the concentration of the resulting DNA is ~200 ng/uL, following the reaction conditions listed above. A concentration of 200 ng/uL will be assumed for subsequent steps of the protocol.\r\n  5. Check the size range of the fragmented DNA by using the Experion DNA 12K Analysis Kit. Typically, with the reaction conditions listed above, the fragmentation results in an average size of ~1,500 bp.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**D. dA-tailing and ds sequencing adaptor-ligation of fragmented rNMPs-embedded DNA**\r\n\n\n1. Set up a dA-tailing reaction as follows:\r\n  \r\n\n\n10X NEBuffer 2: 5 uL\r\n\n\n10 mM dATP: 1 uL\r\n\n\n200 ng/uL Fragmented DNA: 25 uL \\(5 ug)\r\n\n\n5U/uL Klenow Fragment \\(3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exo\u2013): 3 uL\r\n\n\nH\n2\nO: 16 uL\r\n\n\nTotal: 50 uL\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2.

Incubate at 55 \u00b0C for 2 h.\r\n  3. Neutralize with 2 M HCl to pH 7. Use pH Litmus Paper to check the pH. Typically, 7.5\u20138 uL is needed for neutralization. \r\n  4. Purify using Agencourt RNAClean XP with elution volume of 20 uL.\r\n  5. Heat the resulting solution at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min to ensure denaturation of dsDNA and immediately chill on ice.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**F. Self-ligation \\(circularization) of rNMP-terminating DNA by AtRNL**\r\n\n\n1. Set up 2 reactions, one without AtRNL \\(AtRNL\u2013) and one with \\(AtRNL+), as follows:\r\n  \r\n\n\nAtRNL\u2013\r\n\n\n10X AtRNL Reaction Buffer: 2 uL\r\n\n\nAlkali-treated DNA: 10 uL\r\n\n\nH\n2\nO: 8 uL\r\n\n\nTotal: 20 uL\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAtRNL+\r\n\n\n10X AtRNL Reaction Buffer: 2 uL\r\n\n\nAlkali-treated DNA: 10 uL\r\n\n\n3.75 uM AtRNL: 5.4 uL\r\n\n\nH\n2\nO: 2.6 uL\r\n\n\nTotal: 20 uL\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFinal reaction concentration of AtRNL is 1 uM.\r\n\n\n3.

Purify PCR mixtures from Primers-only, AtRNL\u2013 T5Exo+ Tpt1+, and AtRNL+ T5Exo+ Tpt1+ using RNAClean XP with elution volume of 15 uL. Controls Primers-only and AtRNL\u2013 T5Exo+ Tpt1+ are also purified so that the amount of actual ribose-seq library can be determined and quantitatively confirmed.\r\n  7. Use Qubit 2.0 \\(dsDNA HS) to quantify the amount of ribose-seq library. Confirm that the amount of purified Primers-only product is similar to the amount of AtRNL\u2013 T5Exo+ Tpt1+. The amount of the actual ribose-seq library can be calculated by subtracting the amount of AtRNL\u2013 T5Exo+ Tpt1+ \\(which should be just primer dimers) from AtRNL+ T5Exo+ Tpt1+. Typically, ~25 nM of the ribose-seq library is resulted."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Ribonucleotides are now widely considered as the most frequently incorporated non-canonical nucleotides in genomic DNA. Here, we describe an approach, ribose-seq, to prepare DNA libraries for next-generation sequencing to map ribonucleotide incorporation into DNA. By specifically targeting and capturing the unique ends of alkali-derived 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic monophosphate or 2\u2032-monophosphate from ribonucleotides embedded in DNA, ribose-seq libraries are constructed. Upon high-throughput sequencing and analysis, the distribution and identity of ribonucleotides in the genome could be determined as recently reported using yeast as a model organism1. Ribose-seq could potentially be applied to any cell type of any organism to allow profiling of ribonucleotide incorporation into genomic DNA.",
