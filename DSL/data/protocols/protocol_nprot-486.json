            "content": "Recent research resulted in the development of several 1D protein structure descriptors. They provide an important alternative for analysis/prediction of the protein structure/function. Numerous computational methods that provide accurate prediction of these descriptors from the protein sequence were proposed; they include secondary structure<sup>1-5</sup>, secondary structure content<sup>6-9</sup>, structural class<sup>10-17</sup>, fold type<sup>18-25</sup>, relative solvent accessibility<sup>26-32</sup>, contact order and number<sup>33-37</sup>, and residue depth<sup>38</sup>. Recent work shows that the tertiary structure can be recovered from three 1D descriptors<sup>39</sup>. \r\n\n\nWe developed a server that integrates predictions of several related descriptors including structural class<sup>17</sup>, fold type<sup>23</sup>, and secondary structure content<sup>9</sup>. The knowledge of these three descriptors was applied in various areas including tertiary structure prediction<sup>40</sup>, identification of domain boundaries<sup>41</sup>, analysis of protein interactions<sup>42</sup> and prion proteins<sup>43</sup>, discrimination of outer membrane proteins<sup>44,45</sup>, and in prediction of secondary structure<sup>46</sup>, coding and noncoding RNAs<sup>47</sup>, folding and unfolding rates<sup>48-52</sup>, folding transition-state position<sup>53</sup>, DNA-binding sites<sup>54</sup>, and enzyme proteins and their class<sup>55,56</sup>. Our server, _iFC<sup>2</sup>_ \\(Integrated prediction of Fold, Class, and Content), is the first to exploit relations between the three descriptors, which are used to develop a cross-evaluation procedure that improves their predictions. _iFC<sup>2</sup>_ predictions provide higher quality than the predictions of the individual methods. \r\n\n\nThe server is located at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/1D/1D.html."

            "content": "**1**| Enter query sequences. \r\n\n\nPrepare one or several protein sequences for prediction. The _iFC\n2\n_ server accepts at most 10 protein sequences each time. The input sequences should be in FASTA format. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2**| Use the prediction server. \r\n\n\nTo use _iFC\n2\n_ server, access the prediction page at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/1D/1D.html. Enter the protein sequences into the \u201cEnter protein sequence\\(s)\u201d box. The sequence has to be provided in FASTA format and the user is allowed to enter up to 10 sequences at the time. The prediction will be executed sequentially and automatically for all entered sequences. The \u201cExample\u201d button fills the box with an example of FASTA formatted sequence. The \u201cReset\u201d button clears the contents of the box.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3**| Choose prediction task. \r\n\n\nThere are 4 options, see Figure 1. The user can either perform single prediction task, i.e., secondary structure content prediction with PSSC-core\n9\n, structural class prediction with SCEC\n17\n, and fold type prediction with PFRES\n23\n, or \\(s)he can use the integrated _iFC\n2\n_ server \\(by pressing on the \u2018all methods\u2019 button), which predicts the three targets at the same time. If _iFC\n2\n_ server is chosen, the cross-evaluation will be performed automatically. After choosing the prediction task, the user should press \u201cStart\u201d button. In the case when sequences entered in the \u201cEnter protein sequence\\(s)\u201d box do not adhere to the FASTA format, an error window that describes the problem will be displayed and the user will be asked to correct the formatting.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**4**| Obtain the results. \r\n\n\nAfter the prediction is done, the user can access the prediction results by pressing the \u201cShow Results\u201d button, or download the results in a comma-separated text format by pressing the \u201cDownload CSV File\u201d button. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**5**| Interpret the results. \r\n\n\nThe results are displayed using a web page, see Figure 2. The page displays \\(from top to bottom) the input sequence, the secondary structure predicted with PSI-PRED\n1\n, the fold type predicted by PFRES\n23\n, the structural class predicted by SCEC\n17\n, the secondary structure contents predicted with PSSC-core\n9\n, and the cross-evaluation results. For the fold type prediction, the output is one the 26 fold types described in\n23\n. For the structural class prediction, the output is one of the four structural classes \\(all-\uf061, all-\uf062, \uf061/\uf062, and \uf061+\uf062). In the case of the secondary structure content prediction, the output is two real values which represent the helix and the strand contents, respectively. The cross-evaluation results include the secondary structure contents of helix and strand re-predicted by _iFC\n2\n_ server \\(which is potentially different from the predictions of PSSC-core\n9\n), the output label provided by _iFC\n2\n_ server which flags the prediction of SCEC as potentially correct or incorrect, and the label generated by _iFC\n2\n_ server that annotates the prediction of PFRES as potentially correct or incorrect."

At the same time, the accuracy of predictions performed with PFRES for the sequences predicted by _iFC<sup>2</sup>_ server as &#x201C;incorrect&#x201D; equals 38.5%."
