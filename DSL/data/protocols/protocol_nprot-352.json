            "content": "Assays to detect cytokine production and degranulation are useful measures of T cell function. Multiparametric flow cytometry makes it possible to precisely phenotype and simultaneously detect these intermediate stages of T cell activation.<sup>1,2</sup> The degranulation of cytotoxic cells, an indicator of cytotoxic potential, results in the transient surface expression of CD107a and CD107b \\(lysosomal associated membrane proteins).<sup>3</sup> A protocol for the _ex vivo_ assessment of antigen-specific cytokine production by mouse CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and the simultaneous presence of CD107a and CD107b, by polychromatic flow cytometry is presented here. In this protocol, C57BL/6 or Balb/c mice were immunized with a live-attenuated strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ \\(actA-Lm). Splenocytes were restimulated _in vitro_ with peptide from listeriolysin \\(LLO91-99 for CD8+ \\(Balb/c), LLO190-201 for CD4+ \\(C57BL/6)) or PMA plus ionomycin. A typical surface staining cocktail consisted of CD4-APC, and CD8-PerCP-CY5.5 and a typical intracellular staining cocktail consisted of IFN-&#x3B3;-PE and TNF-&#x3B1;-PE-Cy7.  To obtain optimal surface staining for CD107a and CD107b \\(FITC conjugates) the antibodies were added for the entire activation period. Staining during activation allows access of the antibody to transiently expressed CD107a and CD107b antigens."

            "content": "**A. Cell Preparation** \r\n\n\n1. Sacrifice mouse and harvest spleen.\r\n  2. Place spleen in a 15ml polypropylene tube containing 5 ml of cRPMI.  Keep on ice until ready to use.\r\n  3. Pour the spleen and media into a cell culture dish containing a wire mesh screen. \r\n  4. Prepare a single cell suspension of the splenocytes by gently pushing the spleen tissue through the wire screen with the rubber plunger end of a 5 ml syringe. Use as little force as possible. Most connective tissue should remain on screen.\r\n  5. Transfer cell suspension from the culture dish into a 15 ml polypropylene tube.\r\n  6. Place the 15 ml tube, containing the cell suspension, upright on ice for 3-5 minutes \\(until clumps settle to bottom).\r\n  7. Transfer the cell suspension to a 50 ml tube with a pipet. Leave the clumps behind.\r\n  8. Dilute the cell suspension to 50 ml by adding 1X PBS. \r\n  9. Centrifuge cells @ 400 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature.  Discard supernatant.\r\n  10. Add 3\u20135 ml of 1X PharmLyse to cell pellet and mix by gently pipetting up and down.\r\n  11. Let cell suspension stand at room temperature for 7 minutes.\r\n  12. Add 10 ml of cRPMI to the cells and mix by gently pipetting up and down.\r\n  13. Pass cell suspension through a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer into a fresh 50 ml tube.\r\n  14. Dilute the cell suspension to 50 ml by adding 1X PBS.\r\n  15. Centrifuge cells @ 400 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature.  Discard supernatant.\r\n  16. Wash with 1X PBS two more times \\(repeat steps 14 and 15).\r\n  17. Resuspend cells in 5 ml of cRPMI.\r\n  18. Count the splenocytes and bring the sample to a concentration of 10x10\n6\ncells/ml in cRPMI.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**B. Preparation of Activation and Staining Reagents**\r\n\n\n1. PMA:  Prepare a stock solution of 1 mg/ml in DMSO, aliquot and store at -20\u00b0C.  This solution is stable at -20\u00b0C for at least six months.

Ionomycin:  Prepare a stock solution of 1 mg/ml in DMSO, aliquot and store at -20\u00b0C.  This solution is stable at -20\u00b0C for at least six months. On day of experiment, dilute an aliquot of frozen ionomycin stock 1:10 in PBS to make 100 \u03bcg/ml concentration.\r\n  3. Peptide:  Peptides representing optimal antigenic epitopes are superior to whole proteins for _in vitro_ restimulation.  Prepare a sterile peptide stock solution of 2 mM in DMSO, aliquot and store at -80\u00b0C.  This solution is stable at -80\u00b0C for at least six months. On day of experiment, serially dilute the frozen peptide aliquot 1:1000 in cRPMI to make 2 \u00b5M concentration.\r\n  4. CD107a/CD107b-FITC Cocktail: on day of experiment combine 0.1 \u00b5g CD107a-FITC with 0.5 \u00b5g CD107b-FITC in 1X PBS. Prepare enough for all required wells such that 10 \u00b5l of the cocktail is added to each well.\r\n  5. Fc Block: Add Fc block to FACS wash buffer at a 1:50 ratio. Make enough to add 100 \u03bcl per well \\(98 \u03bcl FACS wash buffer + 2 \u03bcl Fc block per well).\r\n  6. Prepare cell surface staining mAbs at optimal \\(previously determined) concentrations by diluting in FACS wash buffer. Mix all surface mAbs in the same tube so that the total volume added per well is 50 \u03bcl.\r\n  7.

Store on ice until ready to use.  Discard leftovers after activation.\r\n  4. Dispense 100 \u03bcl of cell suspension \\(1x106 cells) into appropriate wells of a 96-well round-bottom cell culture plate. Avoid cell clumps and cells which have settled to the bottom of the tube.\r\n  5. Dispense cells into additional wells \\(one well per color plus an unstained control) for use as instrument setup and compensation controls. These cells will be stained with a single antibody each \\(e.g., CD4-FITC, CD4-PE, CD4-PE-Cy7, CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5, or CD4-APC).\r\n  6. Add 100 \u03bcl of the working stock of each activator to the appropriate wells. \r\n  7.

To continue the procedure, thaw the plate at 37\u00b0C for ~20 min.\r\n  29. Add 100 \u03bcl of 1X Perm Wash Buffer to each well. \r\n  30. Centrifuge the plate at 500 x g for 5 min. Note that the cells are permeabilized and fixed at this point and require stronger centrifugation to pellet.  Be sure to centrifuge at 500 x g for this and all following centrifugation steps\r\n  31. Remove supernatant by flicking the plate.\r\n  32. Add 50 \u03bcl of intracellular staining mAb \\(prepared in Step 7 of previous section) to appropriate wells, mix by pipetting up and down. \r\n  33.
