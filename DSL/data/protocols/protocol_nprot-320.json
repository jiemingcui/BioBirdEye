            "content": "Synthetic peptides, with a single or multiple modification sites, are widely used as substrates to study protein modification enzymes, such as kinases and phosphatases <sup>1-5</sup>. However, unlike protein substrates, peptides with a small molecular mass and a low binding affinity to matrices have limited use for certain assays. For example, peptides are not suitable for western blot and often display low sensitivity in ELISA <sup>6-9</sup>. In this protocol, we describe a method that utilizes phosphopeptides to produce ligated phosphoprotein \\(LPP) substrates for the study of protein phosphatases <sup>8, 10, 11</sup>.  Synthetic phosphopeptides were easily ligated through a carboxyl-terminal reactive thioester of an intein-generated carrier protein \\(CP) to yield the LPP substrates. These substrates were used for immobilization and ELISA analysis on a 96 well microtiter plates <sup>12</sup>. This approach circumvents the problems associated with inefficient and variable binding by small peptides to polystyrene microtiter plates, thus resulting in significantly higher sensitivity and consistency, when compared to the use of free peptide substrates."

Phosphopeptide ligation with a carrier protein to generate ligated phosphoprotein \\(LPP) substrates\r\n  \u2022 Timing, 4-16 h \r\n\n\nAn intein mediated protein ligation \\(IPL) reaction is conducted by mixing the carrier protein \\(CP) and phosphopeptide \\(T3pThr, or Cdc2pTyr) in a molar ratio of at least 1:25 \\(CP: peptide). The reaction is usually carried out at 4\u00b0C for 16 h or at 25\u00b0C for 4 h, with ligation efficiencies typically in the range of 40%-75% when using purified peptides possessing an N-terminal cysteine.  This extent of ligation usually requires the synthetic peptide to be present at a final concentration of 0.5-1.0 mM. The ligation reaction is evaluated by a shift of mobility of the LPP compared to the unligated CP on a Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE. Peptides can be stored in a powder form or as a stock solution \\(5-10 mM) at -80 \u00b0C. The excess of unligated free peptide can be removed by dialysis using a nitrocellulose filter or a Slide-a-lyzer.

            "content": "&#x2022; We have found ligation to work with both crude and purified peptides. Ligation with crude peptides at 4 &#xB0;C overnight can result in a wide range of ligation efficiencies, usually in the range of 10-50%, whereas, ligation with purified peptides usually yields 45-90% ligation. Ligation of 10% of the carrier protein \\(CP) is usually sufficient to detect a positive signal in western blot analysis. However, to ensure the greatest amount of ligated product we recommend using a purified peptide at 0.5-1 mM final concentration. A peptide can be purified on a Vydac semi-preparative C18 column for reverse phase purification using a 180 min linear gradient, 10%-100% B with a flow rate of 2 mL per minute. Buffer A is 0.1% TFA/ H2O \\(V/V), and buffer B is 0.1% TFA/60% CH3CN/40% H2O \\(V/V/V).\r\n\n\n&#x2022; The shelf life of a thioester tagged carrier protein is at least nine months if stored in a pH 6.0 buffer. Greater than 50% ligation was observed when the carrier protein was stored for 12 months at -80 &#xB0;C.\r\n\n\n&#x2022; An internal or a C-terminal cysteine in a peptide could affect the ligation efficiency of the peptide to a carrier protein. The inclusion of 10 mM MESNA in the ligation reaction can reduce the effect of disulfide bond formation of cysteine-containing peptides.  \r\n\n\n&#x2022; Even if the peptide is not completely soluble, the amount of ligation product may be sufficient for detection by ELISA. We have found that ligation of a CP with a partially soluble peptide overnight at 4 &#xB0;C  can result in 10-50% ligation efficiency and generate positive signals in immunoassays. If necessary, dissolve the peptide first in dimethyl sulfoxide \\(DMSO), dilute in water, and use in ligation. We usually add 15-25 &#x3BC;L of DMSO for up to 2 mg of peptide, and then add water to make a 2-10 mM stock solution. \r\n\n\n&#x2022; Since the peptide is ligated to a CP through a peptide bond, the ligation product is stable and can be stored at &#x2013;20 &#xB0;C for up to one month or at &#x2013;80 &#xB0;C for at least 6 months. \r\n\n\n&#x2022; The 96-well plate should be washed only with PBS prior to phosphatase reaction. After phosphatase treatment, plates should be washed with PBST or TBSTT. \r\n\n\n&#x2022; Non-specific signal can be significantly reduced by incubating antibodies in PBST buffer with 2% nonfat dry milk.\r\n\n\n&#x2022; Manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions for optimizing the phosphatase assay e.g. enzyme titration) should be followed."

The ligation efficiencies can be easily monitored by detecting a shift in mobility of the ligation products compared to the unligated carrier protein as shown in Figure 1a and 2a. The use of the LPP substrates, CP27-T3pThr and CP27-Cdc2pTyr, allowed for an easy detection of the dephosphorylation activity of TC PTP and PP1 with a phospho-specific antibody as demonstrated in Figure 1b and 2b. In contrast, the free peptides, T3pThr and Cdc2pTyr, exhibited low signal intensities with or without the enzyme treatment under the same conditions, indicating their inefficient binding to the polystyrene surface and/or poor interaction with the enzyme or antibody."

The ligation reaction was carried out by incubating a mixture of approximately 18.5 &#xB5;M CP and 1 mM peptide in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 10 mM MESNA at 4 &#xB0;C overnight. The ligated phosphoprotein (LPP) or unligated free phosphopeptide was applied to a 96-well microtiter plate, treated with T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC PTP) and then reacted with a phosphotyrosine antibody followed by a secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, P-Tyr-100 was prepared at a dilution of 1:2000 in PBST containing 2% non-fat milk. The colorimetric signal was developed with 2,2&#x2019;-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and read at OD415. Each data point represents the average of three experiments. (a)  Ligation of the carrier protein CP27 to Cdc2pTyr examined by SDS-PAGE. The ligation of CP27 (lane 2) to the peptide was detected by a mobility shift on a Coomassie Blue stained 10-20% SDS-PAGE  (b) Dephosphorylation activity of TC PTP on the LPP substrates.  ",
