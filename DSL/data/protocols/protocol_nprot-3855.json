            "content": "As member of a class of acute-phase reactants that mediates innate and adaptive immunity <sup>1-3</sup>, CRP plays an important role in the host defense by binding to phosphocholine and related molecules on microorganisms. This important biomarker needs to be measured routinely in infectious and inflammatory conditions <sup>4</sup>, neonatal sepsis <sup>5-9</sup>, depressive and posttraumatic stress <sup>10-12</sup>, diabetes <sup>13-15</sup> and cardiovascular diseases <sup>16-20</sup>. The normal human sera contain CRP in the range of 0.8-480 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> <sup>2</sup>, compared to 10-40 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> in patients with mild inflammation and viral infection. In active inflammation and bacterial infections, and severe bacterial infections, the CRP levels in sera are in the ranges of 40-200 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> and >200 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively <sup>2</sup>. In case of neonatal sepsis, two clinically-relevant CRP concentration ranges need to be determined i.e. normal \\(0.2-480 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>) and high sensitivity \\(0.08-80 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>). A high sensitive CRP IA is performed, which is followed by the normal CRP IA if the CRP level is above 80 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>. \r\n\n\nTo date, different analytical methods <sup>21</sup> have been developed for the determination of CRP, such as immunoturbidimetry <sup>22,23</sup>, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA) <sup>24-26</sup>, surface plasmon resonance <sup>27</sup>, chemiluminescence <sup>28</sup>, impedimetry <sup>29</sup>, beads <sup>30</sup>, microgravimetry <sup>31</sup>, reflectometric interference spectroscopy <sup>32</sup>, electrochemistry <sup>33</sup> and microfluidics <sup>34</sup>. Nevertheless, ELISA is still the most widely used IA format in clinical settings due to its high precision and sensitivity. \r\n\n\nThis article describes a rapid and highly-sensitive CRP IA format <sup>35</sup> \\(**Fig. 1**) in conjunction with a smartphone-based colorimetric reader \\(SBCR) <sup>26</sup>, which enables the precise determination of CRP in diluted human whole blood and plasma. The developed IA \\(DIA) aims at the differential diagnosis of neonatal sepsis <sup>36,37</sup>. It is a signal-enhanced IA format based on the increased surface area provided by the use of graphene nanoplatelets \\(GNPs), which leads to higher covalent binding of the capture CRP antibody \\(Ab). The Ab immobilization is performed by a novel and highly simplified procedure based on the admixing of EDC-activated Ab with GNPs in APTES inside the MTP wells. The use of APTES <sup>38</sup> and heterobifunctional crosslinking yields a leach-proof covalent binding of Ab to the GNPs-functionalized MTP. The bioanalytical performance of the DIA is compared with that of the conventional sandwich ELISA and the clinically-accredited analyzer-based IA."

It detects CRP with a dynamic range and linearity of 0.03-81 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.3 to 81 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively \\(**Fig. 3A**). The LOD, LOQ, EC50 and correlation coefficient \\(R2) values were 0.07 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, 0.9 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, 6.6 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.999, respectively. It detects the entire clinically-relevant CRP range \\(0.08-480 \u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup>) in spiked clinical samples after appropriate dilution \\(**Fig. 3A**). The intraday and interday variability, determined from five assay repeats in triplicate in a single day and on five consecutive days, respectively, were 2.3-9.3 and 3.1-14.6, respectively. The DIA has high specificity for CRP as it is unaffected by immunological reagents and non-specific control proteins, as shown by various experimental process controls and the use of LCN2, HFA, HSA, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 \\(**Fig. 3B**). The selected non-specific proteins are usually elevated along with CRP in patients with infections and other disorders.  \r\n\n\nThe determination of CRP in anonymized EDTA plasma samples of patients by the DIA correlated well with the clinically-accredited Roche COBAS<sup>\u00ae</sup> 8000 modular analyzer-based IA and the conventional sandwich ELISA \\(**Table 2**) as the percentage recoveries of CRP by the DIA were in the range of 98.1-117.0. The anti-human CRP Ab-bound and BSA-blocked MTPs demonstrated high functional stability and leach-proof covalent binding of capture Ab as there was no decrease in their functional activity when stored at 4 \u00baC in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4 for up to 6 weeks \\(**Fig. 3C**). Therefore, the DIA can be employed in clinical diagnostics, where the Ab-bound MTPs need to be stored for up to 4 weeks to facilitate rapid CRP detection. The covalent binding of Ab and the GNPs functionalization was further characterized by FTIR analysis. There was no obvious batch-to-batch variability for various preparations of GNP-anti-CRP Ab when tested for the detection of 9 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> CRP, thereby demonstrating a high reproducible Ab immobilization procedure \\(**Fig. 3D**). The DIA is generic and can be reliably employed in clinical and bioanalytical settings. It can be employed to develop novel and fully automated POC IVD kits using lab-on-a-chip technologies, microfluidics and smart system integration."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "A highly-sensitive immunoassay \\(IA) procedure with minimal process steps has been developed for the detection of human C-reactive protein \\(CRP) in less than 30 min. Graphene nanoplatelets \\(GNP) was admixed with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane \\(APTES) and EDC-activated anti-human CRP antibody \\(Ab) to form a stable complex that was then covalently attached to a KOH-pretreated polystyrene microtiter plate \\(MTP). The developed one-step kinetics-based IA involves the formation of a sandwich immune complex followed by two washings and an enzyme-based colorimetric reaction that was read by a smartphone-based colorimetric reader \\(SBCR). The detection range of CRP was 0.03-81 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> with a limit of detection \\(LOD) and a limit of quantification \\(LOQ) of 0.07 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.9 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Moreover, the developed IA enabled the detection of CRP spiked in diluted human whole blood and plasma as well as CRP present in clinical plasma samples with high analytical precision, thereby demonstrating its immense utility for biomedical diagnostics.",
