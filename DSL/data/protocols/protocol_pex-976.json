            "content": "<p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting clinical condition coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have caused a worldwide pandemic. There have been 4.8 million confirmed infections and 318,000 deaths worldwide as of May 19, 2020<sup>1</sup> resulting in significant global and personal insecurity<sup>2,3</sup>. Mitigation of the pandemic requires a multifaceted strategy to reduce clinical morbidity/mortality, disease spread, and ultimately vaccination. The bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has been administered to almost 4 billion people worldwide for over 100 years for the prevention of tuberculosis (TB)<sup>4</sup>. When given in conjunction with anti-viral vaccinations including yellow fever and influenza, patients pre-treated with BCG have demonstrated reduced viremia, decreased levels of circulating cytokines associated with cytokine storms, and no difference in, or an improved, anti-viral antibody response<sup>5,6</sup>. These observations may be associated with a shift in the T-cell mediated response to pathogens, enhanced trained innate immunity, and/or an as yet undiscovered pathway<sup>7</sup>. However, they provide an immunologic foundation which suggests BCG vaccination is associated with clinically meaningful immunomodulatory function.&nbsp;Several studies have observed reduced CSM/CFR in countires with active BCG vaccination programs, suggesting that there is some degree of protection from severe COVID-19 infection, especially in elderly populations<sup>8,9,10</sup>. Employing unsupervised machine learning methods with adjustment for numerous variables and potential established confounders associated with mortality, we evaluated the association between covariates designated <em>a priori</em> including BCG vaccination programs and mortality associated with COVID-19 at a country level utilizing pre-specified inclusion criteria.&nbsp;</p>"

Selection of countries for inclusion in analysis\nInclusion criteria included: more than 2,000 cases as of May 5, 2020, population greater than 5 million, and land area greater than 1,000 km\n2\n(to exclude city-states with the potential for non-representative population densities).\u00a0Exclusion criteria included countries where BCG program start year could not be ascertained.\n\ufeff\n2. Data collection and consolidation\nAll data leveraged originated from publicly available data sources (Supplementary Table 1). A set of potential disease related mortality drivers spanning seven domains - socio-economic, health system readiness, environmental, existing disease burden, demographics, vaccination programs, and response to the pandemic were selected a priori (Supplementary Table 2). COVID-19 specific mortality (CSM) was the primary outcome, defined as deaths related to COVID-19 per million population assessed 30 days after 100 reported cases.\n\ufeff\n3. Data Treatment\nAll variables were uniformly capped at the 97'th percentile and floored at the 1'st percentile.\nMissing value treatment is detailed in Supplementary Table 5.\n4. Feature selection using exploratory factor analysis\nWe sought to group countries into comparable clusters based on previously described CSM drivers. To do this, we first assessed the correlation amongst pre-determined variables related to CSM (Supplementary Figure 1) which demonstrated substantial correlation between several explanatory variables. Therefore, exploratory factor analysis, an unsupervised machine learning method to reduce the original set of explanatory variables, was performed. The optimum number of factors were chosen using the scree plot (Supplementary Figure 2). An elbow was observed between 7 and 8 factors (Supplementary Tables 3a and 3b)\n11\n. Varimax rotation was used to maximize the loading of each variable on a single factor. From each factor group, variables were chosen as inputs for subsequent clustering and multiple regression analysis based on loading characteristics and expert consensus where loading values were similar. Given the large size of the first factor group, three variables were selected from the group. Population density was considered as a distinct group given low loading (below 0.3) value and included in addition to one other variable from group 6. There was low variation of values for factors in group 7 thus no variables were included from this group. The variables selected included GDP per capita, population, population density, temperature (Celsius), percentage of the population above 65 years of age, and stringency index (SI) (a measure of country level interventions in response to COVID-19)\n12\n.\n5. Grouping of countries based on k-means clustering\nCountries were clustered utilizing the k-means algorithm\n13\n. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the average silhouette coefficient and Dunn Index (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Figure 3). Countries within a cluster were further segmented based on a categorical metrics related to BCG vaccination programs including if the country\u2019s BCG vaccination program was active and at least 40 years old or 15 years old based on prior works indicating a reduction of vaccination efficacy after a period of 15-40 years\n14,15\n. Deaths per million from COVID-19 thirty days after each country crossed 100 reported cases was compared for countries with currently active universal BCG vaccination programs and for either the preceding 40 or 15 years and those without within a cluster. Countries within each cluster demonstrated lower coefficients of variation in testing rates compared to the whole population, and therefore normalization of testing rates was not performed.\n6. Validation using step wise linear regression\nTo explore whether the findings were robust compared to alternate analytical approaches, we performed sensitivity analyses using linear regression models analyzing variables from each of the factor groups and CSM as the dependent variable. Step wise linear regression was used to retain variables with a statistically significant impact on CSM.\nDetailed R code can be found in the Supplementary Files."

Nine city states with insufficient land area or population and 141 countries with insufficient cases were excluded. Four countries met inclusion criteria but start dates for BCG vaccination programs were not available. China was excluded from the analysis as it was the first country to report widespread cases of the virus and therefore might have introduced a lead time bias.&nbsp;</p><p>Factor analysis resulted in the identification of six, distinct variables including GDP per capita, population, population density, temperature, percent population above 65 years, and stringency index (Table 1). Variables related to BCG administration were part of a distinct factor group. Countries within clusters had lower variation of both COVID-19 testing rates and Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) scores, compared to the overall population. Two cluster solutions, with 6 and 9 clusters, demonstrated the highest scores (Dunn Index and Silhouette Score). Since findings were similar between the 6 and 9 cluster groups and cluster 9 only included 1 country in the 9-cluster solution (Supplementary Table 6), data for the remainder of the manuscript is presented from the six-cluster solution. </p><p>&nbsp;Deaths per million related to COVID-19 (CSM) was assessed 30 days after each included country reported 100 cases. Five of 6 clusters allowed division and comparison of CSM by the presence or absence of BCG vaccination programs for the preceding 15 years (BCG15) (Figure 2a). The remaining cluster composed exclusively countries with BCG vaccination programs (no comparison group-cluster 2).&nbsp;All 6 clusters allowed division and comparison of CSM by the presence or absence of BCG vaccination programs in the preceding 40 years (BCG40) (Figure 2b). Four of 5 clusters demonstrated lower mortality when they had BCG15 and 4 of 6 clusters demonstrated the same association with BCG40. For BCG40, specificity, clusters 1, 3, 5, and 6 demonstrated improved CSM with hazard ratios of 0.03, 0.01, 0.17, and 0.47, respectively. Cluster 2 and 4 demonstrated worse CSM with hazard ratios of 2.43 and 2.24, respectively. The results from the 9-cluster analysis were similar (supplementary table 7). Granular data regarding clustering is presented in supplemental tables 8a/b.</p><p>Using multivariate regression analysis, the presence of BCG15 (reduction of CSM by 71% (95% CI:&nbsp;53 to 89%), total population (for every 1 million person increase there was a 1% decrease in CSM (95% CI: 0.53 to 1.47%), and share of the population above 65 years (CSM increased by 10% for each percent increase in population over 65 (95% CI:&nbsp;2 to 18%) were shown to be significantly associated with CSM. Percent coverage metrics for vaccinations including RCV1 (Rubella), MCV1 (Measles) and OPV (Polio) were forced into the model and were not significantly associated with CSM.&nbsp;</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Population-level data have suggested that bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination may lessen the severity of COVID-19; prior reports have demonstrated conflicting results. We leveraged publicly available databases and unsupervised machine learning, adjusting for established confounders designated a priori, to assign countries into similar clusters. The primary outcome was the association of deaths per million related to COVID-19 (CSM) 30 days after each included country reported 100 cases with several factors including vaccination. Validation was performed using linear regression and country-specific modeling. This protocol details the statistical analyses used to establish an association between BCG vaccination and CSM, which includes : Definition of the target function, data processing, exploratory factor analysis for variable selection, k-means clustering and step wise linear regression for validation. This protocol is differentiated from previous works on the same subject by its' comprehensive nature which considers the effect of several confounding variables while studying the association between BCG vaccination and CSM. There are still several potential measured and unmeasured confounding variables which could not be included in this study. It is also unclear if the protection from neonatal vaccination with BCG is transferable to those receiving vaccination as an adult and how long such protection lasts. The authors advise caution against routine BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19 until prospective trials are completed.</p>",
