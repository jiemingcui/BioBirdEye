            "content": "<p>Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in physiological and pathological biological processes <sup>1-7</sup>. The transcriptome and cell identities of different cell types/states with the same DNA are determined by multilayers of epigenetic information. Recently, technologies for single-cell profiling of multi-dimensional chromatin states have been developed, such as various scChIP-seq techniques for DNA-binding proteins and histone modifications <sup>8-12</sup>, scATAC-seq for chromatin accessibility <sup>13</sup>, MNase-seq for nucleosome positioning <sup>14</sup>, scBS-seq for DNA methylome <sup>15</sup> and scHiC for higher-order chromatin structure <sup>16</sup>. Although these methods measure multiple modalities of single cells, each provides only specific layers of cellular heterogeneities. To build connections across these layers in single cells, innovative computational platforms emerge to integrate unpaired single-cell omics datasets and project different molecular information into a common latent space <sup>17,18</sup>. However, existing strategies require priori knowledge-based correspondence across multimodal omics datasets from different</p><p>experiments, limiting the ability to reconstruct an accurate view of functional relationship between different modalities of epigenomic features and gene expression as well as the crosstalk between different epigenetic layers.</p><p>More recently, unlike those profiling molecular layers one at a time, new approaches have been developed to experimentally link the transcriptome and epigenome by simultaneously measuring multi-omics in the same single cells, making it possible to precisely analyze single-cell-resolved epigenomic regulation of gene expression and cell fate decisions. For example, several various single-cell co-assays (combined scATAC-and scRNA-seq) for joint analysis of accessible chromatin and gene expression have been developed, permitting inference of the correlation between cis-regulatory elements and putative target genes <sup>19-22</sup>.</p><p>Apart from chromatin accessibility, other important molecular layers of the epigenome are covalent modifications to histones and chromatin occupancy of DNA binding proteins, providing a critical guidance for determining transcriptional outcomes<sup>23</sup>. Two elegant studies demonstrated the proof-of-concept application of simultaneously quantifying of protein\u2013DNA interactions and transcriptome in single cells by scDam&amp;T-seq and scCC <sup>24,25</sup>. Both methods rely on a transgene expressing transcription factors or chromatin binding proteins tethered to Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) or piggyBac transposase for scDam&amp;T-seq and scCC, respectively, limiting the likelihood of wide adoption and the potential implementations, in particular for studying clinical human samples. Moreover, the same strategy cannot measure various histone modifications in single cells. Here, we develop a high-throughput method for single-cell joint detection of chromatin occupancy and transcriptome. This approach, named CoTECH (combined</p><p>assay of transcriptome and enriched chromatin binding), adopts a combinatorial indexing strategy <sup>9,26</sup> to enrich chromatin fragments of interest as reported in CoBATCH in combination with a modified Smart-seq2 procedure <sup>27</sup> to simultaneously capture the 3\u2019 mRNA profiles in the same single cells. To demonstrate the utility of CoTECH, we used it to study the relationship between multiple histone modifications and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and the regulatory basis of endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) in two waves of hematopoietic cells. Experimentally linking chromatin occupancy to transcriptional outputs and inferred molecular association between multimodal omics datasets made possible by CoTECH enables reconstructions of higher dimensional epigenomic landscape, providing new insights into epigenome-centric gene regulation and cellular heterogeneity in many biological processes.</p>"

The CoTECH method adopts a combinatorial indexing strategy to enrich chromatin fragments of interest as reported in CoBATCH in combination with a modified Smart-seq2 procedure to simultaneously capture the 3\u2019 mRNA profiles in the same single cells. The whole experimental procedure can be handled within three days.The CoTECH acquires data quality of 1000-9000 unique mapped reads (DNA partition) and 1500-4000 expressed genes (RNA partition) per cell. Experimentally linking chromatin occupancy to transcriptional outputs and inferred molecular association between multimodal omics datasets made possible by CoTECH enables reconstructions of higher dimensional epigenomic landscape, providing new insights into epigenome-centric gene regulation and cellular heterogeneity in many biological processes. This step-by-step protocol is related to the publication \u201cSingle-cell joint detection of chromatin occupancy and transcriptome enables higher-dimensional epigenomic reconstructions\u201d in Nature Methods.</p>",
