            "content": "Single time-point studies, following animal sacrifice, do not reliably reflect the status of transplanted islets and considerable efforts are now being devoted to the development of noninvasive islet imaging techniques for visualizing transplanted islets _in vivo_<sup>1-6</sup>. Islets are difficult to quantify _in vivo_, because they constitute less than 2% of total pancreatic mass, and the problem is compounded with transplants, because the number of islets is considerably less than in the native pancreas. Positron emission tomography \\(PET) is a well-established quantitative and noninvasive imaging modality<sup>5-14</sup>. With the PET reporter gene \\(PRG)/PET reporter probe \\(PRP) system, based on a mutant form of herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase \\(_HSV1-sr39tk_), the PET signal is directly proportional to the enzymatic activity of sr39TK<sup>9-14</sup>. In this protocol, we describe in detail a method for reporter gene labeling of islets and quantitative scanning using the reporter probe 9-\\(4-\\[<sup>18</sup>F]-Fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)-guanine \\(\\[<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG). Islets expressing _HSV1-sr39tk_ are transplanted into mice, either under the kidney capsule or into the liver, followed by injection of \\[<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG. PET imaging of phosphorylated, trapped, ligand enables quantification of transplant mass."

For all mouse studies, analgesics are administrated \\(Metacam \u00ae \\(meloxicam) injectable, 1-2 mg/kg). \r\n\n\n1. Anesthetize male C57BL/6 \\(8 - 12 week old) mice with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital \\(30 - 40 mg/kg).\r\n  2. Once the animal is fully anesthetized, make a midline skin incision, in the abdomen under the rib cage. \r\n  3. After exposure of the pancreas, clamp the common bile duct and distend the pancreas by injecting 2 - 3 ml of collagenase \\(1000 U/ml) in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution \\(HBSS) through the pancreatic duct with a 30G needle. \r\n  4. Remove the pancreas and euthanize the donor mouse by an appropriate technique, as recommended by your animal care committee. \r\n  5. Place the pancreas in a 50 mL tube containing 2 - 3 mL of collagenase \\(1000 U/ml) in HBSS for 13-min in a water bath at 37 \u00b0 C. \r\n  6. Stop the digestion by adding 15 mL of cold HBSS II.\r\n  7. Shake the tubes by hand to disrupt the pancreas. \r\n  8. Centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 1 min and aspirate the supernatant. \r\n  9. Resuspend the pellet with cold HBSS II. \r\n  10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 twice.\r\n  11. Resuspend resulting pellets in RPMI 1640 Solution B. \r\n  12. Pour resuspended solution onto a pre-wetted 70 \u03bcm nylon mesh cell strainer.\r\n  13. Wash the filter with RPMI 1640 Solution B.\r\n  14. Rinse the captured islets into a petri-dish with RPMI 1640 Solution A.\r\n  15. Repeat steps 1 to 15 for the second mouse. \r\n  16. Hand-Pick and count individual islets under the microscope and transfer to fresh RPMI 1640 medium A. Using this method, we generally obtain an average of 200 islets per mouse. \r\n  17. Culture the islets in RPMI 1640 medium A. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**II. Virus infection of islets**\r\n\n\n18. Expose islets to 250 multiplicity of infection \\(m.o.i.) of purified recombinant adenoviruses expressing _HSV1-sr39tk_ \\(rAD-TK), for 2 h at 37 \u00b0 C in a CO\n2\nincubator. \r\n  19. Centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant. \r\n  20. Resuspend the pellet with HBSS. \r\n  21. Repeat steps 19 and 20 twice. \r\n  22. Re-culture islets in RPMI 1640 Solution A. \u2022 PAUSE POINT: Islets can be cultured for 16-24 h until transplanted.    \r\n  \r\n\n\n**III-1. Islet transplantation under the kidney capsule**\r\n\n\n23. Induce general anesthesia of male C57BL/6 \\(8-12 week old) mice by isoflurane inhalation. \r\n  24. Once fully anesthetized, place the mouse on a heating pad, shave and wash the skin with 70% Ethanol over the surgery site. \r\n  25. Perform a lombotomy, and expose the right kidney. \r\n  26. Make a breach in the kidney capsule.\r\n  27. Introduce a polyethylene catheter through the breach and advance in the subcapsular space to the opposite pole of the kidney. \r\n  28. Slowly inject the islets through the catheter and allow them to spread at the pole. \r\n  29. Retrieve the catheter, cauterize the opening and reposition the kidney.\r\n  30. Close the musculo-peritoneal layer with # 5.0 absorbable suture in an interrupted pattern. \r\n  31. Close the skin incision with # 5.0 absorbable suture in an interrupted pattern.  \r\n  32. Wash the surgical site again with proviodine solution for an aseptic preparation. \r\n  33. Repeat steps 24 to 32 for the surgery of the left kidney. \r\n  34. Monitor the mouse during recovery, and do not mix with conscious animals. \u2022 PAUSE POINT: Mice can be kept until PET scanning\r\n  \r\n\n\n**III-2. Intrahepatic islet transplantation**\r\n\n\n35. Induce general anesthesia of male C57BL/6 \\(8 - 12 week old) mice by isoflurane inhalation. \r\n  36. Once fully anesthetized, place the mouse on a heating pad, shave and wash the skin with 70% Ethanol over the surgery site. \r\n  37. Make a midline skin incision, in the abdomen under the rib cage. \r\n  38. Carefully raise the musculo-peritoneal layer to avoid damage to the bowel. \r\n  39. Make an incision in the peritoneal wall directly beneath the cutaneous incision.\r\n  40. Move the intestine to the right using cotton-tipped applicators, and expose the hepatic portal vein.  \r\n  41. Slowly inject the islets \\(in a standard 200 \u03bcl volume) into the hepatic portal vein using an insulin syringe \\(29 \u00bd\u201d G), and allow them to spread in the liver. \r\n  42. Using a cotton-tipped applicator, press the surgifoam against the injection site, and simultaneously retrieve the syringe carefully from the portal vein.\r\n  43. Apply the surgifoam to completely stop the bleeding, then remove. \r\n  44. Close the musculo-peritoneal layer with # 5.0 absorbable suture in an interrupted pattern, taking care to avoid perforation of the underlying bowel. \r\n  45. Close the skin incision with # 5.0 absorbable sutures in an interrupted pattern.  \r\n  46. Wash the surgical site again with proviodine solution for aseptic preparation. \r\n  47. Monitor the mice during recovery, and do not mix with conscious animals. \u2022 PAUSE POINT: Mice can be kept until the PET scanning.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**IV. Radiosynthesis of \\[\n18\nF]FHBG** \r\n\n\n9-\\(4-\\[\n18\nF] - Fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl) - guanine \\(\\[\n18\nF]FHBG) is synthesized by a modification of the method of Ponde _et al._\n16\n.\r\n\n\n48. Dissolve Kryptofix 222 \\(12 mg) and K\n2\nCO\n3\n\\(3 mg) in 0.4 mL of water: acetonitrile 1:3. Dissolve FHBG precursor \\(1.5 mg) in 0.4 mL of acetonitrile: DMSO 1:1.\r\n  49. Place a vial with \\[\n18\nF]F-/\n18\nO-water \\(200 - 300 mCi, from 15 min cyclotron target irradiation in our laboratory) into a hot cell, and connect addition and transfer lines.\r\n  50. Push air through the addition line to transfer\n18\nO-water into a water recovery vial.  Connect anion exchange resin to the reaction vessel.\r\n  51. Through the same addition line, pass a solution of K\n2\nCO\n3\n/Kryptofix 222 followed by a gentle flow of helium \\(the first addition line is no longer used).  Changes in the vessel radiation probe reading estimate the amount of starting \\[\n18\nF]F-.\r\n  52. Connect a second addition line to the reaction vessel \\(with a needle going to the vessel bottom), place the vessel in an oil bath and dry liquid with a gentle stream of helium.\r\n  53. Remove traces of water by addition and evaporation of acetonitrile \\(3 \u00d7 0.33 mL).\r\n  54. Add the solution of precursor \\(Tosyl-FHBG) via the addition line.\r\n  55. Place the vessel into an oil bath and heat for 10 min \\(100 \u00b0 C)\r\n  56. Put reaction vessel back in the nest, connect went and addition line.  Add 0.3 mL of 2 M HCl.\r\n  57. Heat the vessel in the oil bath for 5 min.\r\n  58. Put reaction vessel back in the nest, connect went and addition line, add 3 mL of saturated sodium tetraborate and introduce a gentle flow of helium to mix the solution. Turn off helium flow. \r\n  59. Remove went line, connect a transfer line.  Slowly transfer half of the reaction vessel content into the injector loop and perform injection. \r\n  60. Collect \\[\n18\nF]FHBG radiopeak into the rotary evaporator, evaporate collected liquid.  \r\n  61. Stop evaporator rotation, add saline, bring rotary evaporator to ambient pressure, turn on rotation for a few seconds, stop rotation, transfer the solution of \\[\n18\nF]FHBG into the product vial. \r\n  62. Weigh product vial and count product radioactivity, withdraw 0.2 - 0.3 mL QC sample and perform analysis by injecting 10 \u03bcL of the sample on analytical HPLC \\(pre-calibrated with non radioactive reference compound). Typical radiosynthesis yield is 5 - 40 mCi of radiochemically pure \\[\n18\nF]FHBG contained in 1.5 - 2 mL of saline. There are 2 or 3 nonradioactive impurities present in the final solution in concentrations similar to that of \\[\n18\nF]FHBG \\(assuming similar UV extinction).  Specific radioactivity is typically > 5 Ci/\u03bcmol and the FHBG concentration < 1 \u03bcg/mL. \r\n  63. Transfer resulting \\[\n18\nF]FHBG to PET suite for microPET studies. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**V. MicroPET scanning**\r\n\n\n64. Transport islet-transplanted mice to the PET suite.\r\n  65. Induce general anesthesia with isofluorane inhalation \\(in a closed container) on the preparation area. \r\n  66. Place the mice on the scanner bed in a prone position. \r\n  67. Fit a nose cone over the face to maintain isoflurane anesthesia throughout the scanning procedure.\r\n  68. Place an intravenous catheter \\(27G butterfly) in the tail vein.\r\n  69. Slowly drip saline to maintain catheter patency.\r\n  70. Draw the required dose of \\[\n18\nF]FHBG \\(100 \u03bcCi), and top the dose with sterile saline for a constant injection volume of 0.5 mL.\r\n  71. Inject \\[\n18\nF]FHBG solution through the tail vein over 20-30 sec.\r\n  72. Start the list mode scanning for 1 h following tracer injection. \r\n  73. Immediately following the scan,  obtain a 15 min attenuation scan. \r\n  74. Remove the intravenous line and the nose cone and monitor the mouse until fully awake. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**VI. Image reconstruction and data analysis**\r\n\n\n75. Determine the framing sequence for the list mode data \\(_i.e._ 6 - 30 sec, 2 - 1 min, 5 \u2013 5 min and 4 \u2013 7.5 min) and reconstruct with filtered back projection \\(FBP) using ASIPro software. \r\n  76. Reconstruct a single time frame from 30-60 min post injection using the three-dimensional iterative maximum _a posteriori_ \\(MAP) algorithm\n17,18\nto improve organ identification and the accuracy of positioning regions of interest \\(ROI).\r\n  77. Determine the 2-3 slices in which the kidney or liver is best visualized and Draw  circular ROIs \\(same size ROI in all the slices) on the kidney or liver areas of the MAP image. \r\n  78. Reposition the ROIs on the corresponding slices of the  kinetically reconstructed data and generate time activity curves \\(TACs) for each region. \r\n  79. Convert the counts/pixel/minute obtained from the ROI to counts/ml/minute by using the calibration constant, obtained from scanning a cylinder phantom filled with a known concenration of activity in the microPET scanner. \r\n  80. Convert the ROI counts/ml/minute to counts/g/minute, assuming a tissue density of 1g/ml, and divide it by the injected dose \\(100 \u03bcCi) to generate the TACs as percentage injected dose of \\[\n18\nF]FHBG retained in the kidney or liver."

If animal moves during scanning, reliable TACs cannot be obtained unless sophisticated movement correction algorithms are applied, which are currently not adequately validated for mice full body imaging. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProblem: Islets are not detected by PET imaging or poor signal-to-background ratio \\(**Step 77**).\r\n\n\nReason: 1. Poor islet viability following islet isolation and viral infection. 2. No expression or poor expression of HSV1-sr39tk in islets. 3. Failure in the surgery.\r\n\n\nSolution: 1. Ensure the viability of islets following islet isolation and viral infection. 2. Ensure _HSV1-sr39tk_ expression and \\[<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG uptake following viral infection _in vitro_. If _HSV1-sr39tk_ is not expressed or poorly expressed in islets following viral infection, i) check whether the viral stock is stored correctly. Aliquot the viral stocks to avoid repeated freeze/thaw, and store at - 80 &#xB0; C. Use appropriate storage buffer \\(10 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 4 % sucrose). pH is critical for long term storage of viral particles. ii) check the multiplicity of infection \\(m.o.i.) of the viral stock and ensure exact amount of virus was added to islets. iii) check whether viral stock is contaminated with replication competent adenovirus \\(RCA). 3. We recommend practicing the surgery using administration of a dye solution. With careful injection, islets should be located in a limited area of the pole kidney capsule or evenly distributed within the liver\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProblem: Poor signal-to-background ratio for other reasons \\(**Step 77**).\r\n\n\nReason: Various\r\n\n\nSolution: 1. It is critical to have high quality of islets with sufficient expression of _HSV1-sr39tk_. PET signals will be reduced with low quality of islets and low expression of _HSV1-sr39tk_. 2. High background signals from the gut may be detectable due to endogenous thymidine kinase localized to the crypts in this region. In our experience, this background signal varies between individual animals."

            "content": "As the PET protocol established resulted from a combination of cellular, molecular biological, physiological, chemical and imaging approaches, strong collaboration between the various groups is essential for its successful performance. The described PET imaging allows functional visualization of transplanted islets by 3-D tomographic resolution. The PET signal, resulting from the uptake and retention of \\[<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG in transplanted islets, is entirely dependent on the enzymatic activity of transduced _HSV1-sr39tk_, and it can be reliably quantified over time \\(**Fig. 1**). **Figures 2-3** show PET images following islet transplantation under the kidney capsule \\(**Fig. 2**) or liver \\(**Fig. 3**).  Reconstruction produces 63 slices, 1.2 mm apart with an in-plane resolution of 1.8 - 2 mm full-width half-maximum \\(FWHM) ensuring that the location of the target organ is reliably established \\(**Fig. 2a-c, Fig. 3a-c**). Furthermore, the uptake of the \\[<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG in the target tissue is readily accessible over time in the TACs \\(**Fig. 2d-e, Fig. 3d-e**). Thus, PET is a powerful technique for quantification of transplanted islets _in vivo_. In view of the increasing incidence of diabetes, and the likelihood that stem cell technology will provide a more widely accessible source of &#x3B2; cells/islets for transplantation, the development of quantitative, reliable and reproducible _in vivo_ monitoring systems will provide invaluable information for the development of new protocols for improving islet survival and temporal post-transplant determinations in humans."
