            "content": "Cucumber \\(_Cucumis sativus_ L.), a crop with economic and nutritional importance that is cultivated worldwide, is a typical raffinose family oligosaccharides \\(RFOs)-transporting plant<sup>1-4</sup>, and a model species for studying phloem functional characteristics and sex determination. Cucumber phloem is very complicated, there is one set of vascular bundle \\(VB, a bicollateral bundle including the internal and external phloem) in the petiole, stem and peduncle, but four sets of VBs in the fruit, including the peripheral, main, carpel and placental VB \\(two bicollateral, two collateral). Cucumber is a monoecious species with unisexual flowers, and is a model species for the study of sex determination. It has seven types of sex phenotypes, including andromonoecious, monoecious, androecious, heterozygous-gynoecious, hermaphrodite, gynoecious and gynoecious-monoecious. In addition, it can be parthenocarpic. However, a lack of effective genetic transformation methods, especially those based on _Agrobacterium_, has severely limited cucumber gene functional analyses and remains a bottleneck for both developing cucumber as a model, and for its improvement as a crop. \r\n\n\nThe transfer and stable integration of genetic material into the cucumber genome will enhance the breeding of more disease resistant cucumber \\(_Cucurbitaceae_ plants or cucurbits) varieties, as well as the characterization of cucumber genes. It offers the possibility to introduce new characters into a cucumber cultivar, which is difficult to achieve via conventional breeding techniques<sup>5</sup>. Recently, the genome sequences of both cucumber and watermelon, another cucurbit, were released \\(http://www.icugi.org/cgi-bin/ICuGI/index.cgi). Moreover, a range of studies have investigated diverse aspects of cucumber biology, such as the rapid fruit expansion that occurs after flowering, and some candidate genes that influence this important process have been identified<sup>6,7</sup>. The development of an efficient cucumber transformation system is therefore timely and critical for gene discovery and validation. \r\n\n\nMany studies have reported successful cucumber transformation, but only a few have obtained a high transformation rate and T<sub>1</sub> generation, and there are very few reports on functional analysis using transformed plants \\(Table 1). The first transformation of cucumber plants, which expressed the NPT II gene, was reported by Trulson _et al_. \\(1986)<sup>8</sup>. This transformation was achieved by infecting cucumber hypocotyl segments with _Agrobacterium rhizogenes_ and regenerating the transformed issue into whole plants. This approach had a low plant regeneration frequency, which limited its utility \\(Table 1). Other reports have described the successful regeneration of cucumber plants from cotyledon explants after transformation using _A. tumefaciens_, but transformation efficiency was still < 12%, and only a few of these studies resulted in transgenic T1 plants \\(Table 1). Higher transformation rates \\(16-23%) have been reported using cotyledon explants<sup>9-11</sup>, but in these studies, the transformation rate was calculated as the identified positive shoots and not plantlets, and few of these lines resulted in a stably transformed T<sub>1</sub> generation. The selection of cucumber transformants using antibiotic selection with kanamycin<sup>9,12</sup>, phosphinothricin<sup>11,13</sup> and hygromycin<sup>14</sup>, have been reported; however the method with the high transformation efficiency \\(23%) reported by He _et al_. \\(2006) was based on mannose and sucrose resistance<sup>10</sup> \\(Table 1).\r\n\n\nOther regeneration protocols with various culture types have also been investigated, such as leaf explants<sup>15</sup>, petioles<sup>15,16</sup>, hypocotyls<sup>14,17</sup>, internodes<sup>17</sup>, protoplasts<sup>18</sup> and suspension cultures<sup>19,20</sup>, but these all showed a lower transformation efficiency than using cotyledons as explants. Until now, _Agrobacterium_-mediated transformation methods using cotyledons as explants has been the most successful approach for cucumber transformation<sup>21</sup>. With this approach, the transformation frequency is dependent on several factors, including plant genotype, explant source and size, _Agrobacterium_ strains and concentration, length of exposure to Agrobacterium, and selection system<sup>22,23</sup>, among others. It was reported that dissecting half of an adaxial cotyledon using a V-shaped cut resulted in a higher transformation rate<sup>24</sup>, while another report showed that using cotyledon nodes as explants resulted in regeneration at the junction of cotyledon and hypocotyl in the proximal regions of the cotyledons<sup>12</sup>. In this current protocol, we use similar explants, half adaxial cotyledons, but we have modified the protocol in that we break off the hypocotyl instead of using the V-shaped cut to detach the growing point. We also highlight the key factors in the procedure that can cause technical problems for the inexperienced researcher.\r\n\n\nOur laboratory has established a rapid and efficient _Agrobacterium_-mediated transformation system for cucumber that differs from previously reported protocols, and we have identified critical factors that influence transformation efficiency. To date, we have produced more than 600 transgenic lines and functionally analyzed a range of cucumber genes using this protocol<sup>25-33</sup>. The method can be widely used in cucumber breeding, variety improvement, and the characterization of gene function, and can be a reference for the transformation of other cucurbits, such as _Cucumis melo_ and _C.metuliferus_<sup>21,23</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Overview of the technique** \\(Figure 1)\r\n\n\nThis protocol consists of seven major steps, which can be briefly summarized as follows: Stage I: preparation of sterilized seeds. Stage II: explant preparation, infection and co-cultivation with _A. tumefaciens_. Stage III: shoot regeneration. Stage IV: root regeneration. Stage V: acclimation and molecular identification of T<sub>0</sub> plants. Stage VI: cultivation and self-crossing of T<sub>0</sub> plants. Stage VII: seed harvest from T<sub>0</sub> plants.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Key factors for successful transformation of cucumber**\r\n\n\n_**Varieties amenable to _Agrobacterium_-mediated transformation**_\r\n\n\nIt has been reported that the genotype of transformed cucumber influences its shoot regeneration frequency<sup>9,21</sup>, and relatively high regeneration rates have been reported for some cucumber genotypes, such as Poinsett 76, Jinyan No.7, Cengel K\u00f6y, Shinhokusei 1, cv. pickling genotype 3676, 3672, and Xintaimici \\(Table 1). However, in our analyses we observed no differences in the regeneration frequency between different cucumber genotypes. We obtained a high regeneration rate \\(80-97 %) for the Deltasta, Guonong25, cucumber line 3413, 3407, 3461, Chinese long: 461, 9930, R1407, R470, short 32x, and Xintaimici genotypes, and obtained transgenic plants from all these varieties. Even so, it is advisable to determine the regeneration rate before using a new cucumber genotype for _Agrobacterium_-mediated transformation, in order to optimize the chance of successful transformation. We note that homozygous varieties should be considered, since they can provide a homozygous transgenic T<sub>1 </sub>generation for subsequent gene functional studies.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Preventing contamination with endophytic bacteria**_\r\n\n\nDifferent endophytes may be associated with different parts of the cucumber seed. Before soaking seeds in tap water for 2 hours, they should be sterilized with HCl and NaClO in a sealed container for 1-2 hours, to kill bacteria on the seed surface or inside the seed coat. Some endophytic bacterial species have been isolated from surface sterilized cucumber seeds, and most of these were located in the seedling radicles<sup>34,35</sup>. It is therefore important to cut off the radicles before detaching the cotyledons to prevent the contamination with endophytic bacteria, and then knocking or breaking off the hypocotyl on new sterilized filter paper.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Explant preparation**_\r\n\n\nThe selection and preparation of explants is critical factor in the success of the transformation pipeline. In our protocol, the embryonic cotyledons are used as the explants. The cucumber seeds should be soaked in water for 2 hours to facilitate the removal of the seed coats and to obtain a high germination rate. The de-coated seeds should then be surface sterilized with 75% \\(vol/vol) alcohol for no more than 1 minute.  \r\n\n\nAfter germination for approximately 2 days on MS/B5 medium, a radicle of 1-1.5 cm and root hairs are visible, and the cotyledons can be detached from the embryos. Half of the adaxial cotyledon is then used as the explant. Seeds have a better germination rate on B5 medium than on MS medium; however, different varieties may have a difference in germination time and media requirements, as well as in how readily the cotyledons can be detached. Forceps, rather than a knife, should be used to detach the cotyledons from the radicle growing point \\(Figure 1, Explant preparation) in order to obtain a higher regeneration rate. \r\n\n\nPrevious studies have shown a high regeneration frequency with cotyledon nodes as explants<sup>36</sup>, and we also found that breaking off the hypocotyl to detach the cotyledon, rather than cutting it, is important to obtain high regeneration frequency. However, care needs to be taken to cut off the growing point of the seedlings to prevent negative plants growing. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Influence of abscisic acid \\(ABA) and 6-benzylaminopurine \\(BAP) levels on shoot organogenesis during shoot initiation and outgrowth**_\r\n\n\nIt has been reported that the hormones ABA and BAP can induce the regeneration of cucumber cotyledon explants<sup>36, 38</sup>, and most of these studies focused on the influence of BAP levels on cucumber shoot regeneration. In this study we have investigated the combined effects of BAP and ABA levels on shoot regeneration from cotyledon explants \\(Table 2, Supplementary Figure S1). We observed that the highest shoot regeneration rate were 76% and 86%, using a ABA/BAP concentration of 1.0/0.8-1.5 mg/l \\(Table 2), and noted that the regenerated shoots grew more slowly with higher ABA and lower BAP concentrations \\(Supplementary Figure S1 A). We therefore chose an ABA/BAP concentration of 1.0/0.8-1.5 mg/l, as this resulted in healthy and fast growing plants, as well as a high regeneration rates with the _Agrobacterium_-mediated transformation system. We compared efficacy of the MS medium and B5 medium for shoot regeneration with a 1.0 mg/l ABA concentration and different BAP concentration, and found that the average number of regenerated shoots per explant in MS and B5 media was 2.5 and 1.0, respectively \\(Table 3, Supplementary Figure S1 B). We concluded that use of the MS medium resulted in the production of more shoots than the B5 medium \\(Table 3), while the B5 medium was more effective for seed generation than the MS medium.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Agrobacterium concentration and infection time**_\r\n\n\nThe _Agrobacterium_ concentration and the infection time were found to be important factors in preventing explant turning necrosis and improving transformation efficiency. We determined that the optical density \\(OD, at 600 nm) of the _Agrobacterium_ culture should be adjusted to approximately 0.25 \\(Table 4), and that the infection time should be about 15 minutes to avoid explant necrosis, and to obtain the highest regeneration rate of 86% \\(Table 4).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Agrobacterium vacuum infiltration**_\r\n\n\nIt has been reported that vacuum infiltration can improve the _Agrobacterium_-mediated transformation of cucumber<sup>12</sup>, and we also found this to be the case. Since we had found that the infection time and _Agrobacterium_ concentration were important in obtaining a high transformation rate, we vacuum infiltrated with _Agrobacterium_ solution and explants in beakerflask \\(OD<sub>600</sub>=0.25) twice for 5 min, and then move them into shaker for an additional 5 min.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Orientation of the explants on the co-cultivation medium**_\r\n\n\nAfter _Agrobacterium_ infection, placed the cotyledon explants on co-cultivation medium with the adaxial surface facing upward, so that the abaxial surface was in contact with the culture medium. We found this to be essential for high transformation efficiency. After 2 days of co-cultivation, we transferred the cotyledons to the shooting medium, and again made sure that the abaxial surface of the cotyledon was touching the medium. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Shoot regeneration and rooting**_ \r\n\n\nWe determined that when regenerated shoots have grown to 1 cm, they should be excised from the cotyledon explants and transferred to rooting medium. Embryoids that appear on the cut end surface should be detached. Regenerated shoots will then grow rapidly and the leaves will expand immediately after transfer to rooting medium. The un-rooted regenerated shoot end shoot then be re-cut and the unfolded leaves and the shoots transferred into new rooting medium once per week for the next 2-3 weeks, ensuring that the lower part of the regenerated shoots are inserted in the rooting medium. We found this to be an effective way to remove residual ABA/BAP from the shoots and to be important for efficient rooting.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Antibiotic Selection**_ \r\n\n\nThe use of kanamycin selection has previously been reported for cucumber transformation<sup>37,38</sup>, and we found it to be more effective than hygromycin since the latter affects plant development. Kanamycin concentrations of 50-150 mg/l are commonly used<sup>14,22,39</sup>, and it has been shown that a higher concentration will slow growth at the rooting stage and suppress regeneration<sup>24</sup>. Here, 50 mg/l was used during shoot initiation, shoot outgrowth and the rooting stage to encourage the regeneration of transgenic plants. In addition to antibiotic selection, PCR should be used to confirm the presence of the targeted transgene in each transformant at each generation. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Plant growth conditions**_ \r\n\n\nSince cucumber is a warm-season crop, the tissue cultures should be kept at 25\u00b0C, and after plant acclimation in the soil, the temperature should be maintained at 28\u00b0C/18\u00b0C with a 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle, which are typical cucumber cultivation conditions."

Incubate in good condition chamber for cucumber growth under light \\(gradually from 300 \u03bcmol m\n-2\ns\n-1\nto 500 \u03bcmol m\n-2\ns\n-1\n, 16 h) at 25\u00b0C/18\u00b0C for 1-2 weeks. Add water into the tray under pots when the soil is getting dry. \r\n  21. Take the zip bags off after the regeneration plants grown in a good condition. Watering the plants when the soil is getting dry. Incubate in under light \\(500 \u03bcmol m\n-2\ns\n-1\n, 16 h) at 25\u00b0C/18\u00b0C for 1-2 weeks.\r\n  **Examination of transgenic plants \u2022TIMING 1 day for handling**\r\n\n\n22. Number the regeneration cucumber plants and cut a peace of the mature leaves, extract the genome DNA using the cetyltrimethy ammonium bromide \\(CTAB) method\n40\n.\r\n  23. Confirm the transgenic plants has been inserted in the T-DNA using the specific primers designed on the T-DNA and do PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis assay. \r\n  **Seed production from transgenic plants \u2022TIMING 1 hour for handling, 8-12 weeks for cultivation**\r\n\n\n24. Transfer the molecular identified transgenic plants to greenhouse, to give seedlings normal environment condition with the temperature no higher than 33\u00b0C and no lower than 16\u00b0C, light intensity 500 \u03bcmol m\n-2\ns\n-1\n, relative humidity 70-80%.\r\n  25. The transgenic cucumber plants require normal cultivation management and artificial self-pollination when plants flowering. On the day before the female and male flower blooming, clip the both the female and male flowers on the same plants, and then do artificial pollination using the same plants male flowers to the female flowers on the second morning, and then clip the female flowers to keep away the pollen from the other plants.\r\n  26. When the epidermis of autocarps are turned yellow and indicated that the seeds are fully mature, pick them up and place under the cool, dry place for 1-2 weeks for the after-ripening of seeds.\r\n  27. Open the cucumber fruit using knife and collect the seeds. Wash the seeds clean with tap water and store in mesh bags under the cool, dry place to dry the seeds.\r\n  28. The transgenic cucumber seeds of T0 can germinated directly in soil or in cultivation containers filled soil and used for further analysis of gene biology after molecular identified the exit of T-DNA insertion. T-DNA identification refer to Step 25 and Step 26."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Genetic transformation is central to the discovery, delivery, and functional analysis of genes, and for associated crop improvement, and yet is technically challenging in many plant species. As an example, cucumber \\(_Cucumis sativus_ L.) is a model species for the study of phloem characteristics, raffinose family oligosaccharide \\(RFO) metabolism and sex determination, but methods for its genetic transformation have generally had low efficiency, thereby limiting basic and applied studies. Here, we describe a rapid and efficient protocol for _Agrobacterium_-mediated transformation of cucumber cotyledon explants, using vacuum infiltration. The transformation efficiency of the regenerated plants was as high as 54%, and the final positive plantlet transformation efficiency was approximately 26% of the total number of infected explants and this is obviously higher than previously published protocols. Transgenic plantlets can be obtained in 3 to 4 months and the transgenic T1 seeds generated in the subsequent 3 to 4 months after self-pollination. Using this protocol, we have obtained more than 600 transgenic cucumber lines. This protocol is of great importance for studies of cucumber and of other _Cucurbitaceae_ species, since it enables gene functional analysis, and so opens a pipeline for rapid cucumber variety improvement.",
