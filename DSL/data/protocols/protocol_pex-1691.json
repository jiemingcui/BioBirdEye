            "content": "<p>Classical labeling methods used for fluorescence imaging such as labeling the target protein with an antibody-dye complex or genetic fusion with a reporter fluorescent protein are limited in their use, particularly in live neurons. Antibodies are quite bulky, even when reduced to their monovalent forms, and only have access to exposed epitopes. The incorporation of fluorescent proteins into a target protein can impede its native function, accounting for biased interpretations and severely limiting its possible site of insertion. There is thus a pressing need for the development of alternative labeling methods that do not depend on epitope accessibility and with sizes compatible with the nanometer precision of super-resolution imaging. </p><p>Click chemistry labeling via genetic code expansion (GCE) offers the possibility for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) containing bioorthogonal groups into a target protein <sup>1,2</sup>. By replacing a native codon at a selected position in the target protein with a rare codon, such as the Amber stop codon, the modified protein can then be expressed into the desired host cells along with an engineered amino acyltransferase (aaRS) and tRNA pair orthogonal to the host translational machinery. The engineered aaRS is modified in a way to only recognize a specific uAA, which is then attached to a tRNA that matches the rare codon. Among a collection of different possibilities, the trans-cyclooct-2-ene (TCO*)-modified amino acids, such as TCO*-L-lysine (TCO*A), is of interest when it comes to targeting and labeling the desired target proteins in living organisms. TCO* can react with a 1,2,4,5-tetrazine in a catalyst-free, fast, specific, and bioorthogonal strain-promoted inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction (SPIEDAC). Due to the high selectivity and fast kinetics of this click chemistry reaction, a large number of fluorophore-tetrazine conjugates and TCO* functionalized molecules are now commercially available making labeling of mammalian cells and whole organisms with organic dyes accessible for live and fixed samples <sup>3-5</sup>. While the use of click-labeling via GCE to fluorescently label proteins in non-neuronal cells is well-established, the use of such strategy to fluorescently label proteins in neurons is just now emerging <sup>6,7</sup>.</p><p>The synaptic protein transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein (TARP) \u03b32 is composed of four transmembrane domains, an intracellular amino- and carboxyl-terminal domain, and two extracellular loops (Ex1 and Ex2)<sup>8</sup>. Due to the close association of the extracellular domains of \u03b32 to the AMPA receptor ligand-binding domain<sup>9-12</sup>, the development of ligands recognizing the extracellular domains of \u03b32 as well as genetic fusion tagging is a challenge<sup>13,14</sup>. Recently, we demonstrated that extracellular domains of \u03b32 can be fluorescently labeled through the use of GCE combined with click-chemistry<sup>6</sup>. To label \u03b32, Ser at position 44 in the \u03b32 Ex1 was replaced by an Amber codon, which during translation allowed the incorporation of the uAA TCO*A. Given that \u03b32 overexpression induces neuronal toxicity, \u03b32 and the engineered PylRS were expressed under a bi-directional doxycycline-induced vector \u2013 pTRE3G-BI PylRS/\u03b32 S44* <sup>6</sup>. Here, we report a simple and reproducible protocol to fluorescently label uAA-tagged transmembrane proteins at the plasma membrane of neurons in both dissociated hippocampal cultures and organotypic hippocampal slice cultures.</p>"

Click-labeling via genetic code expansion (GCE) has received particular attention given its potential has the ultimately small labelling probe for proteins. Click-labeling via GCE offers a reliable and sterically minimally demanding capacity to label proteins, but its application in non dividing cells such as neurons remains poorly exploited due to its low efficiency. Here, we describe a simple, efficient and reproducible protocol that allows to fluorescently label transmembrane proteins in live neurons using click-labeling via GCE, both in dissociated culture and organotypic brain slices.</p>",
