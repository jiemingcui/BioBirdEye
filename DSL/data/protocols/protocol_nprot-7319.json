            "content": "Current biocompatible protein cleavage can only be achieved using various proteases including Tobacco Etch Virus protease, thrombin protease, etc.1 However, enzymatic protein cleavage may not be ideal method to achieve protein cleavage. The enzymes added often desired to be removed. Enzymes can be prohibitively expensive, especially when producing large amount of proteins. For therapeutic protein production involving enzymatic cleavages, quality control of enzymes is also required. At last, enzymatic cleavages often fail, especially for membrane proteins when the enzyme substrates locate near membrane blocking enzyme access. Here we developed a strategy to chemically cleave proteins under biocompatible conditions with efficiency comparable to enzymes. We name this technology SNAC-tag as sequence-specific chemical protein cleavage. SNAC-tag can be inserted into unstructured protein regions and Ni<sup>2+</sup> can then be used to site-specifically cleave SNAC-tag at room temperature within 24 hours."

We take protein HisTag-T4L-GSHHW-3hbtmV2 \\(membrane protein) as the example to illustrate the protocol.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Take 0.5 mL of imidazole \\(250 mM) eluted HisTag-T4L-GSHHW-3hbtmV2 into Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal filters, spin 4 times to exchange buffer into cleavage buffer: 0.1 M CHES, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M acetone oxime, 5 mM DPC, pH 8.6. Note, imidazole has to be completely removed before cleavage.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. After 4 times buffer exchange, measure protein concentration to be 0.5-1.0 mg/mL, if protein concentration is higher, dilute protein concentration to this range using cleavage buffer.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. To a 1.7 mL eppendorf tube, add 10 uL NiCl2 \\(0.1 M), then add 1 mL of HisTag-T4L-GSHHW-3hbtmV2 into the same tube, vortex gently to mix well. \r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Incubate reaction at room temperature \\(22 \u00b0C) for 16 hours. Don\u2019t shake or vortex.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Run protein gel to monitor reaction after 16 hours to see cleavage progression. If not complete, reaction can be left longer until complete.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. After reaction is done, add protein solution to centrifugal filters again to exchange protein \\(3 times) into desired buffer \\(0.1 M Tris, 0.25 M NaCl, 5 mM DPC, pH 8.0), and to remove free Ni2+. \r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Add 0.2 mL bed volume of Ni-NTA beads to the protein solution and rotate to extract the cleaved tag to give desired protein."

            "header": "Troubleshooting",
            "content": "1. When purifying proteins, we suggest not using SDS as detergent since SDS is difficult to remove and it does inhibit SNAC-tag cleavage.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. If HisTag is used for protein purification, imidazole must be removed completely from protein before cleavage, imidazole greatly inhibits SNAC-tag cleavage.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. When protein and Ni2+ are mixed together, sometimes we do see protein precipitations.  When protein precipitation is observed, we have a few suggestions to overcome this problem:\r\n  a. adding 0.5 M guanidine hydrochloride to cleavage buffer before mixing protein with Ni2+, we think this might be the best way to avoid protein precipitations.\r\n\n\nb. adding 1 mM TCEP into cleavage buffer prior mixing protein with Ni2+. This can alleviate protein precipitations, but protein precipitations might still occur, solution might turn yellowish after mixing TCEP and Ni2+.\r\n\n\nc. Using 50 mM Tris buffer instead of CHES buffer, since Tris binds Ni2+ leaving less free Ni2+, but using Tris could slow down cleavage rate.\r\n\n\nd. Using pH 8.2 buffer instead of pH 8.6 buffer, this might help in some situations.\r\n\n\ne. Explore other weakly Ni2+ binding reagents, we think protein precipitation is liked caused by non-specific interactions between Ni2+ and protein molecules, weak Ni2+ binders can stabilize Ni2+ reducing non-specific interactions between protein and Ni2+, thus decrease protein precipitation tendency.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. If protein molecules have unpaired Cys, it is likely Cys oxidation might occur. In this case, 1-2 mM TCEP could be added to cleavage buffer to consume free oxygen in solution. When the cleavage reaction happens in reducing environment, Cys oxidation could be avoided."
