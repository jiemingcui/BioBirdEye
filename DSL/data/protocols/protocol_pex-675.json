            "content": "<p>Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a common and critical RNA modification, affecting millions of sites in the human genome. The vast majority of RNA editing activity, mediated primarily by ADAR (ADAR1), occurs in noncoding parts of the transcriptome<sup>1</sup>. The typical target consists of a long noncoding dsRNA formed by pairing of two inverted copies of repetitive elements<sup>2</sup>. In particular, the human transcriptome harbors more than a million copies of the ~300bp-long <em>Alu</em> repeat. Due to their abundance, pairing of two neighboring <em>Alu </em>elements is common, resulting in long dsRNAs. Millions of editing sites have been identified within human <em>Alu</em> repeats<sup>2\u20138</sup>, accounting for almost all editing activity in the human transcriptome. </p><p>Comparative analysis of ADAR activity across multiple samples is as yet an unmet challenge. For this purpose, one desires a single quantitative measure representing the global editing behavior in each sample. Since virtually all human editing events take place in <em>Alu</em> repeats<sup>8</sup>, we define and present here the <em>Alu</em> Editing Index (AEI), a robust measure that retains the full <em>Alu</em> editing signal. We provide a software package, enabling a straight-forward calculation of the AEI for multiple samples from raw RNA-sequencing data.</p><p>For any set of pre-determined genomic regions, the editing index is defined as the weighted average of the observed editing levels over all adenosines, where the weights are the total coverage of each site<sup>9</sup>. It avoids the need to quantify the editing level per-site and accounts for the editing activity, including editing events residing in low-coverage regions, while maintaining a very low false discovery rate including lowly-covered regions. For convenience, we multiply this by 100, so that the index describes the per-cent level of editing in the set of regions. In human, virtually all ADAR activity occurs within <em>Alu</em> elements<sup>5\u20138</sup>, spanning ~11% of the human genome. Thus, we study hereafter the <em>Alu</em> Editing Index (AEI), which is the weighted average over tens of millions of genomic adenosine sites located within <em>Alu</em> sequences. Note that the same approach can be used for other sets of genomic regions in any organism, as long as editing therein is strong enough to allow for sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). </p><p>To estimate the noise, mismatches due to technical and biological source rather than <em>bona</em> <em>fide</em> A-to-I editing, we calculate \"control indexes\", measuring the abundance of other types of mismatches (many times the highest of these &nbsp;is the C-to-T index,&nbsp;as it represents both a common genomic mutation and C-to-U RNA editing).</p>"

Sorting and indexing your BAM files can save run-time later, but is not necessary.\nStep B \u2013 Running RNAEditingIndexer\nThe BAM files and the corresponding reference genome are to be used as the input to the RNAEditingIndexer. We recommend using either a virtual environment such as conda or to use the provided Docker image).\nFor human, the RNAEditingIndexer averages (by default) on Alu repeats. For mouse, the default regions are B1 and B2 repeats. If your genome doesn\u2019t have built-in support you will need to prepare the needed regions, annotations and SNPs files as described in the documentation.\nThis step uses all the programs described in the documentation (BamUtils, SAMtools, and BEDTools). It is recommended to check both the logs and the output to the screen for errors as some errors will not abort the execution"
