            "content": "Human primordial germ cells \\(hPGCs), the precursors of sperm and eggs, originate during development of early postimplantation embryos<sup>1,2</sup>. Recent studies on the human germline have provided the first indications of the probable mechanism of hPGC specification<sup>3,4</sup>, and their subsequent development _in vivo_<sup>5-7</sup>. These studies reveal striking mechanistic differences between mouse and human, which may in part be due to the divergence in the regulation of their pluripotency network, and postimplantation development<sup>8,9</sup>.\r\n\n\n  Since direct observations of early human embryos are impossible, we have designed a combinatorial approach to investigate the origin of hPGCs in the context of early postimplantation epiblast development. This approach includes _ex vivo_ observations on porcine gastrulating embryos, which as in humans, develops as a bilaminar disc embryo, as well on isolated peri-gastrulation porcine epiblasts. Secondly, we have used human and monkey pluripotent stem cells \\(PSCs) to develop an _in vitro_ model that recapitulates peri-gastrulation development. The combined model systems provide insights on early human development and mechanisms of early cell fate decisions.\r\n\n\n  Here, we present details of PSC-based in vitro model for simulating early human development leading to gastrulation. The key features of the approach shows that monkey and human PSC stimulated by ACTIVIN and WNT signaling exhibit transient gain and loss of competency for PGC fate in the precursor of mesendoderm \\(Pre-ME).  Further differentiation into functional mesendoderm \\(ME) potentially gives rise definitive endoderm \\(DE) and mesoderm. This protocol provides a tractable model for mechanistic insights during gastrulation and on early cellular and developmental transitions, which could include epigenetic priming of regulatory elements for context dependent roles of transcription factors, for example, during specification of PGCs and the DE."

Store the solution at 4\u2103 up to 2 wk.\r\n\n\n\u30fbaRB27: Mix 28.8ml of Advanced RPMI 1640 medium, 300 \u00b5l of B27, 300 \u00b5l of NEAA, 300 \u00b5l of L-Glutamine and 300 \u00b5l of Penicillin-Streptomycin solution. Store the solution at 4\u2103 up to 1 wk.\r\n\n\n\u30fbME medium: Mix 10 ml of aRB27, 100 ng/ml Activin A, 3 \u00b5M CHIR99021 and 10 \u00b5M Y-27632. Freshly prepare the medium before use.\r\n\n\n*For lateral mesoderm \\(LM) induction, addition of 100 ng/ml BMP2 in ME medium enhances the induction efficiency.\r\n\n\n\u30fbPGC medium: Mix 10 ml of aRB27, 500 ng/ml BMP2, 10 ng/ml hLIF, 100 ng/ml mSCF, 50 ng/ml mEGF and 10 \u00b5M Y-27632. Freshly prepare the medium before use.\r\n\n\n*Option \\(recommended); add 2.5% PVA into PGC medium to increase the efficiency of aggregation.\r\n\n\n\u30fb10% \\(wt/vol) stock solution of PVA: Gradually add 2 g of PVA to 20 ml water \\(tissue culture grade) with vigorous shaking and leave it at 4\u2103 for a few hours. Then, the solution is warmed in 37\u2103 water bath overnight to facilitate solubilization. For sterilization, filtrate 0.45 \u00b5m filter and store it at cold room at least 3 mo. For 10 ml of PGC medium, add 250 \u00b5l of 10% PVA stock. \r\n\n\n\u30fbDE medium: Mix 10 ml of aRB27, 100  ng/ml Activin A and 0.5 \u00b5M LDN193189.\r\n\n\n\u30fbLM medium: Mix 10 ml of aRB27, 100 ng/ml BMP2, 10 \u00b5M SB431542 and 2.5 \u00b5M IWR1.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**1. Culture of PSC**\r\n\n\nHuman pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs) are maintained in Essential 8 medium10 on vitronectin-coated dish according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol \\(https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/references/protocols/cell-culture/stem-cell-protocols/ipsc-protocols/culturing-puripotent-stem-cells-essential-8-medium.html). Alternatively, we found mTeSR1 medium \\(Stem Cell Technologies) and Geltrex\\(Thermo Fisher scientific)-coated dish are also suitable for this purpose. Routine cultures of hPSCs are maintained by passaging after dissociation of cells with 0.5mM EDTA after every 3-5 days.\r\n\n\n  Cynomolgus monkey PSCs \\(cmPSCs) are cultured in modified cmPSC medium on MMC-treated or irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast \\(MEF: lower density, approximately 2x10e5 cells/well \\(6well plate)). cmPSCs are routinely passaged with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA to dissociate them into single cells every 3-5 days. Thereafter, dissociated cells are cultured following addition of 10 \u00b5M Y-27632 in modified cmPSCs medium.\r\n\n\n  Although both hPSC and cmPSC can be maintained in conventional PSC medium such as DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20%KSR and 10-20 ng/ml bFGF on MEF, in our experience, the induction efficiency of these cells for ME and PGC was more variable and inconsistent. Cells from conventional medium could be switched to the optimal conditions described above by passaging for two times or more, prior to the induction of ME and PGC.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2. Induction of ME**\r\n\n\n1. Aspirate medium and wash PSCs with 1 ml of PBS.\r\n  2. Add 0.2-0.3 ml 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA\r\n  3. Incubate at 37\u2103 for 3 min\r\n  4.

Use at\n12 h \\(Pre-ME) for hPGC induction and at\n24-30 h \\(ME) for DE/LM induction\r\n  \\(Caution: the precise timings might vary with different cell lines or culture conditions) \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3. Induction of PGC from Pre-ME**\r\n\n\n11. Aspirate medium and wash cells \\(Pre-ME cells: normally 12 h after ME induction) with 0.5-1 ml of PBS.\r\n  12. Add 0.2-0.3 ml 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA\r\n  13.

Centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 4-5 min.\r\n  15. Aspirate supernatant and suspend cells in PGC medium \\(100 \u00b5l)\r\n  16. Pipette cells few times.\r\n  17. Count the number of cells.\r\n  18. Dilute the cell suspension with PGC medium to and adjust the concentration of  cells to 4x10e3 cells/100 \u00b5l/well.\r\n  19. Add 100 \u00b5l of the cell suspension into a single well of Corning\u00ae Costar\u00ae Ultra-Low attachment multiwell plates.\r\n  20. Centrifuge the plate at 1,200 rpm for 1-2 min to \u2018aggregate\u2019 the cells to the bottom of the wells\r\n  21. Culture for 2-5 days.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**4. Induction of DE and LM**\r\n\n\n22. Aspirate medium and wash cells \\(ME cells: normally 24-30h after ME induction) with 0.5-1 ml of PBS.\r\n  23. Add 1 ml of DE or LM medium\r\n  24. Culture for 2-3 days \\(DE) or for 1-2 days \\(LM)\r\n  *We confirmed that paraxial mesoderm can also be induced from ME by activation of WNT signaling \\(3 \u00b5M CHIR99021) and suppression of ACTIVIN and BMP signaling \\(10 \u00b5M SB431542 and 0.5 \u00b5M LDN193189) at high efficiency \\(80%< CXCR +ve, CDX2 +ve), as shown in previous report11."

Also, hPSCs with a suitable reporter, for hPGCs such as NANOS3-tdTomato \\(NT), the reporter expression is detectable from day 2 onwards by fluorescent microscopy and by FACS; the fluorescence becomes progressively brighter. The hPGC induction efficiency can be monitored after 4-5 days by FACS using the NT reporter \\(or equivalent), or after staining with anti-alkaline phosphatase and CD38 antibodies. The gating strategy and the FACS profiles are described elsewhere12.\r\n\n\n  For the DE induction from ME \\(24h), these can be verified two days after induction by immunostaining for DE markers \\(SOX17, FOXA2). The efficiency of human DE induction can be deduced after 2-3 days by FACS using anti-CXCR4 antibody.\r\n\n\n  For LM induced from ME \\(24h), these can be detected using LM markers \\(FOXF1, HAND1) from 1 day onwards by immunostaining. An estimate for LM induction efficiency is possible by FACS after 1-2 days by staining cells with anti-PDGFRa antibody."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "This protocol describes an _in vitro_ model using pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs), for early human development simulating key events leading to gastrulation. Gain and loss of competency for the specification of primordial germ cells \\(PGCs) occurs in the course of mesendoderm \\(ME) differentiation, a common precursor for definitive endoderm \\(DE) and mesoderm. This model is also applicable to cynomolgus monkey PSCs \\(cmPSCs). The observations suggest conserved principle for peri-gastrulation development of the epiblast. The protocol is suitable for investigations relating to early postimplantation development and mechanisms of early cell fate decisions in primates.",
