To culture the follicles, the MEM\u03b1 medium was supplied with 10% FBS, 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS; Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/mL FSH (ovine Follicle Stimulating Hormone, NHPP) and 0.1% penicillin and streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and was pre-warmed to 37\u2103 before using.\n2.\nPreparation of the Matrigel microdroplet\nThe precooling liquid Matrigel was mixed with culture medium (3:1), and then added to 6 well culture plate to make the microdroplet (20 \u03bcL per droplet, 6 droplets per well) on ice by pipette (Tip: Make sure the tips were precooled to avoid the coagulation of gel). Gently putting the plate into the 37\u2103 incubator. After around 20 min, the phase of Matrigel droplets changed from liquid to solid.\n3.\nOvarian follicle culturing\n:\n(1) Collecting the mouse ovaries from the C57BL/6 females at postnatal day (PD) 21, washing the ovaries with PBS to remove the blood and then put in 35 mm culture dish with 2 mL basic medium.\n(2) Tearing the ovary to the small pieces, and gently isolating the ovarian follicles (diameter 120-160 \u03bcm) by Omnican U-40 Insulin syringe in the medium. Choosing the follicles with intact theca layer to culture.\n(3) Poking the solid Matrigel microdroplet to make a hole in the center of droplet by mouth pipette, and transfer one isolated follicle and seed it into the hole of Matrigel microdroplet by mouth pipette.\n(4) Repeating step 3 to seed one follicle into each microdroplet.\n(6) Adding the 2 \u03bcL liquid Matrigel to seal the hole and put the plate into incubator at 37\u00b0C for 10 min to make the gel solid. After this step, the cultured follicles were completely surrounded by the gel.\n(7) Adding 1 mL the culture medium to each well, culturing the ovarian follicle in incubator at 37\u00b0C (5% CO\n2\n, saturation humidity) for 8 days and replaced half of the culture medium every other day.\n4.\nTracing the follicle growth:\n(1) In ovarian follicle diameter tracing experiment, the developmental dynamics of follicles were recorded by the increase of the diameter in bright field with a Nikon Eclipse Ti digital fluorescence microscope. The survival rate of the follicles was around 350 \u03bcm after 8 days cultured."

The development of follicles is a highly programed progress and is regulated by both the paracrine and endocrine factors. To culture the follicle <em>in vitro</em>, various approaches were established in different groups including the 2-dimensional culture and 3-dimensional culture. In this study, we improved a three-dimensional Matrigel system to culture the mouse follicles from secondary stage. In this system, the 3D culture guaranteed spherical structures of the follicles, which was utilized to trace the difference of growth dynamics of follicles in mutant and wild type females.&nbsp;</p>",
