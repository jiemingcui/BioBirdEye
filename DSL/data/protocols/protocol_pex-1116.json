            "content": "<p>The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is a neurovascular unit (NVU) that serves as a physical and chemical barrier against plasma components, blood cells, and pathogens for protecting the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB also controls the exchange and movement of nutrients, hormones and other molecules into and out of the brain for proper functioning of the CNS<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>1</sup></a>. Previous studies have demonstrated that the BBB consists of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), astrocytes, neurons, pericytes, and extracellular matrix around the vessels composed mainly of type IV collagen, fibronectin, laminin, heparan sulfate, and perlecan<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>3</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>4</sup></a>. </p><p>Pericytes play an essential role in the maintenance of the BBB and the dysfunction or degeneration of the pericytes contributes to the pathogenesis of diverse CNS disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Huntington\u2019s disease, ischemic stroke and so on<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>1</sup></a>. Therefore, pericyte replacement therapies may help to restore normal pericyte function and BBB integrity in these disorders. However, the scarcity of material sources greatly limits the application of primary pericytes in disease modeling and cell transplantation studies. Accordingly, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with the properties of self-renewal and pluripotency present an ideal cell model for the isolation of pericytes to study their development or the therapeutic effect in pericyte-related diseases. Although there are several protocols describing the derivation of pericytes from hPSCs, they are either time-consuming or may generate heterogeneous pericyte population with different origins<a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>6</sup></a>. Here, we successfully derive pericyte-like cells with cranial neural crest (CNC) origin from hPSCs (designated as hPSC-CNC PCs), which may represent an ideal cell source for the treatment of pericyte dysfunction-related disorders and help to model the human BBB in vitro for the study of the pathogenesis of such neurological diseases.</p>"

Remove the hPSC medium from the wells and wash with 1 X PBS twice.\n3. Add a minimal amount of Accutase solution needed to cover the surface of the wells and incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO\n2\nfor 5\u201310 min.\n4.

At the same time, prepare the digested and filtered cells that are unstained as blank controls.\n16. Add 4ml PBS containing 0.1% BSA and centrifuge at 1100rpm for 4min.\n17. Discard the supernatant. Repeat step 16 to remove any remaining antibodies.\n18. Resuspend cells in 300-700ul PBS containing 0.1% BSA and perform cell sorting by flow cytometry. Collect p75\nbright\nHNK1\n+\ncells (cranial neural crest cells) and culture in NCCM for further culture.\nhPSC-CNC PCs differentiation phase III: pericyte-like cells induction\n19.
