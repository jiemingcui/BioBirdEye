            "content": "Transfection of primary mouse T cells represents a major breakthrough in addressing research areas as T cell function, activation, and signaling in _in vitro_ systems. In this study, we show transient transfection of genes into na&#xEF;ve mouse T cells using nucleofection, a modified electroporation technique. Using this approach, we knocked down endogenous Smad3 by efficient delivery of Smad3 shRNA into antigen-specific na&#xEF;ve T cells isolated from TCR-transgenic mice. The resultant transfected T cells could be safely adoptively transferred into syngeneic recipients and were fully capable of responding to TCR-mediated activation _in vivo_. This protocol offers the possibility for rapid functional in vivo studies of targeted genes in primary mouse T cells. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nGene transfer technologies are a crucial tool to study gene regulation as well as for the analysis of the expression and function of proteins in T cells. Most commonly, standard cell lines are used for studies in these fields because gene transfer into these cells is easy. However, they show cancer-like growth pattern and often these cell lines have deviated from the cell type they originated from. Manipulation of gene expression in T cell lines and clones by the introduction, deletion, or mutation of specific genes, has enabled dissection of molecular requirements for T cell activation, signaling and function. However, these cultured cell lines do not represent the physiologic state of normal non-transformed T cells. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn mice and rats, _in vivo_ modulation of gene expression by transgenesis as well as knockout and knock-down technologies has been important for unraveling of functions of specific genes and pathological processes. However, these approaches are costly and time-consuming and are particularly problematic for genes that affect T cell development \\[1-3] or in na&#xEF;ve T cell differentiation \\[4], as viable animals may not develop. To overcome these limitations, attempts have been made to engineer gene expression in mature, na&#xEF;ve T lymphocytes. Early, murine leukemia virus-based vectors have been used to transfect genes into in primary mouse T cells activated with mitogens, anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies, or antigens \\[5-8], resulting in infection efficencies ranging from 10% to 20%, and 40% to 90%. There are significant limitations to this approach, as resting T cells are not permissive to infection by murine leukemia viruses. Although adenoviral vectors are widely used for gene delivery into adherent cell lines, primary cells of the lymphoid lineage are largely refractory to adenoviral transduction \\[9]. Furthermore, viral transduction approaches carry the considerable disadvantages of limited transgene size, time-consuming vector construction, and viral stock generation, in addition to the biohazard risk \\[10].\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nRecently, non-retroviral-mediated gene delivery systems, such as electroporation have been widely adapted to transfection of primary human T lymphocytes. Electroporation has been shown to efficiently introduce DNA into activated, and even freshly isolated human T cells \\[11-13], with transfection efficiencies of 32% in primary human T cells \\[14]. In contrast, resting mouse T cells are resistant to DNA uptake via conventional electroporation \\[15,16]. Years ago, Amaxa set the first milestone in overcoming this obstacle with the Nucleofector Technology. It is a major improvement of the electroporation technology.  Using this new technology, it has been shown that na&#xEF;ve CD4 positive T cells exhibited transfection efficiency of 6-12%, resting memory CD4 positive T cells exhibited substantially higher transfection efficiency \\(23% to 25%), and effector cells displayed the highest transfection efficiency \\(35%) \\[17]. Recently, the Goffinet _et al_ study demonstrated high-level non viral gene delivery in all major classes of primary lymphocytes from rodents \\[10].\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nIn the present study, we combined the Amaxa nucleofection technology and adoptive transfer, to successfully knock-down endogenous Smad3 protein by using Smad3 shRNA. By using the resultant transfected cells we further demonstrated that Smad3 is involved in the regulation of antigen-specific T cell responses and in the induction of T cell tolerance by costimulation blockade."

Place the spleen into a 40 \u00b5m pore size nylon cell strainer on the top of 50 ml Falcon tube. Use plunger from 3 ml syringe to crush the spleen and force as much as tissue as possible through the cell strainer. \r\n  2. Loose cell strainer from top of Falcon tube to facilitate rinsing. Rinse plunger and cell strainer with 10 ml PBS\u20130.5% BSA into tube and transfer the whole cell suspension into a 15 ml Falcon tube. \\(The use of 15 ml Falcon tubes for centrifugation steps will lead to lower cell loss during removal of supernatant).\r\n  3.

This step should take no longer than 15 min otherwise, cell viability and gene transfer efficiency is significantly compromised.  Avoid air bubbles while pipetting. Close cuvette with the blue cap.\r\n  6. Select X\u201301 Nucleofector program. Insert cuvette into the cuvette holder and press the \u201cX\u201d button to start the program. \r\n  7. To avoid damage to the cells remove the samples from the cuvette immediately after the program has finished \\(display showing OK). Take the cuvette out of the holder.

            "content": "High level transfection efficiency in primary mouse T cells is the ultimate aim of nculeofection technology. In our studies, the range of transfection efficiency in various experiments was 60% to 75% \\(Fig. 1).  Applying Smad3 shRNA resulted in detectable molecular and functional outcomes. Expression of Smad3 shRNA  reduced endogenous Smad3 levels about 70% to 90% after a single transfection \\(Fig. 2). This degree of down-modulation is within the range previously reported for other primary cell systems \\[18] and is sufficient to induce a clear functional phenotype in our model system. Our studies showed that elimination of endogenous Smad3 by Smad3 shRNA resulted in augmented responses after priming and resistance to tolerance induction after tolerizing immunization _in vivo_ \\(Fig. 3).  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe have found that the following factors are critical in this protocol in order to achieve high transfection efficiency. First, intact cell viability prior to nucleotransfection is required. We strongly recommend avoiding an erythrocyte lysis step during cell preparation, as this will decrease cell viability. For enrichment or purification of the targeted population use negative selection methods \\(untouched methods) which reduce the risk of activating cells and increasing cell mortality. Second, the transfected cells should be cultured in supplement&#x2013;enriched and conditioned culture medium for a period of time. Using other types of medium will most likely result in low cell viability and low level transfection efficiency. In our experiments, after 3 hours of culture, viability of the transfected cells was above 80%. Third, the optimized _in vivo_ immunization protocol was required for high&#x2013;level transfection and transgene expression. In our _in vivo_ study model, the mice were immunized with antigen three to eight hours after intravenous injection of transfected TCR trensgenic cells and this approach resulted in high transfection efficiency of antigen-specific cells \\(above 60%). In contrast, when transfected cells were left in culture medium _in vitro_, transfection efficiency at 12 and 24 hours of culture was 10&#x2013;15% consistent with previous reports in na&#xEF;ve T cells \\[17].\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCollectively, nucleotransfection technology provides great promise as a tool for a rapid and simple pre-validation strategy for _in vivo_ knockdown and transgene approaches. This technology requires various steps and investigators may wish to perform preliminary studies to optimize the conditions required for best transfection efficiency in their experimental systems."

Lymphocytes were harvested on d5 after treatment, and transfection efficiency of DO11.10 cells (KJ1&#x2013;26^+^) was examined by FACS analysis. Results represent six independent experiments. The same pattern of results was observed for all transfected populations and the range of transfection efficiency in various experiments was 60&#x2013;75%.",
