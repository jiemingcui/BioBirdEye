            "content": "Procedure\nGeneral Guidelines\n1. Read this entire document and\nEGL005.03\n96 well Library Construction using Agilent Bravo\nSOP before starting this procedure for the first time.\n2. Given the nature of single cell work, it is crucial to always wear gloves when handling sample plates, reagents and equipment, and to treat everything with clean PCR techniques. Use two layers of gloves and switch the outer gloves anytime something outside of the dedicated single-cell laminar flow hood is handled. Use a disposable lab coat throughout this procedure.\n3. All work should be performed inside a dedicated single-cell work only enclosed PCR workstation and an enclosed Bravo liquid handler.\n4. Before starting, turn on the PCR workstation, place a clean autoclave bag in the waste container, clean all work surfaces and equipment such as pipettes, centrifuge, vortex thoroughly with RNAse Away or DNA Away spray.\n5. Use Eppendorf LoBind PCR clean plates for samples and the less expensive AB-1400-L plates as reservoirs.\n6. Seal all plates with a plastic EdgeBio cover every time they exit the hood and never re-use covers. Use MicroAmp adhesive film applicator to create a good seal around each well.\n7. Keep the samples and brews on ice. Enzymes should only be taken out of the freezer just before addition to the brew, transported only in a designated pre-chilled to -20\u00b0C cold-block \\(CoolRack M15), then immediately returned to the freezer.\n8. Plates should never be vortexed. Plate mixing steps are only to be done using 12-channel pipette or using the Bravo.\n9. When placing plates on the Bravo deck, make sure that the A1 well is always in the upper left corner.\n10. All reagents except enzymes should be aliquoted for single use. All buffers should be well mixed by repeated pulse-vortexing before addition to the brew. \u00a0 All brews should be well mixed by repeated\ngentle\npulse-vortexing before dispensing into reservoir to assure an equal distribution of all components and thus uniformity of enzymatic treatments across a plate.\n11. At the end of each working day, discard all used plastic ware and remove the waste bag first, then wipe down all work surfaces with RNase Away or DNA Away.\nReagents to prepare in advance\n1. Spike-In mix preparation:\n1.1. In a LoBind 1.5mL PCR clean Eppendorf tube, prepare equal mass mix of: methylated T7 gDNA and unmethylated lambda gDNA and dilute to 20ng/uL with Qiagen EB buffer. Aliquot for single use and store at -20\u00b0C. Prepare 1ng/uL dilution of the mix using Qiagen EB buffer, check the quant using Qubit HS Assay, aliquot for single use, and store at -20\u00b0C for up to 3 months.\n1.2. Retrieve one aliquot of 1ng/uL Spike-In mix and dilute to 6pg/uL using Qiagen EB buffer, mix very well by repeated pulse-vortexing, and aliquot single use. Store in a LoBind Eppendorf tubes at 4\u00b0C for up to two weeks \\(scPBAL Box).\n2. Positive control preparation:\n2.1. In a LoBind 1.5mL PCR clean Eppendorf tube, prepare 2.5ng/uL dilution of HL60 gDNA using Qiagen EB buffer, mix very well by pipetting \\(do not vortex), and check the quant using Qubit HS Assay. Aliquot for single use \\(6uL/tube) and store at -20\u00b0C for up to 6 months.\nDAY 1\nSingle cell Lysis\n1. The input for this procedure is a plate containing single cells \\(or nuclei) sorted into 384-well plate \\(Quadrant A only \u2013 see image below for sorting plate layout) and snap frozen dry in liquid nitrogen or ethanol/dry ice bath.\nSee figure in Figures section.\n2. Prior to starting this procedure confirm the plate layout with the supervisor to determine the location of single cell and 10 cell wells within the 384 well plate.\n3. Put a fresh pair of gloves, get fresh ice and keep the ice pan outside of the PCR workstation for now. Check -20\u00b0C freezer \\(20-1) to make sure that a chilled Coolrack XT PCR96 and Coolrack M13 are ready. Turn on the PCR machine and place a piece of tape on it to indicate it is in use.\n4. Put on a new disposable lab coat, turn on the PCR work station and clean the single-cell PCR space and equipment as per instructions in General Guidelines, section 1.0 above. Wipe down the ice bucket with RNase or DNA Away before placing it inside the now clean single-cell work station.\n5. Retrieve one aliquot of 2.5 ng/uL stock of HL60 gDNA from 4\u00b0C \\(scPBAL Box) and keep it on ice.\n6. Retrieve one aliquot of 6pg/uL of Spike-In mix from the 4\u00b0C fridge and keep it on ice. Using LoBind tube \\(labeled as SC spike-in), make 100X dilution by mixing 2 uL of the Spike-In mix with 198 uL of Ultrapure distilled water \\(Invitrogen). This should yield 60fg/uL concentration. Mix very well by multiple pulse-vortexing. Keep it on ice.\n7. Inside the PCR work station, working on ice, in a LoBind 1.5mL tube, prepare the\nLysis brew\naccording to the following calculator:\nSee figure in Figures section.\n8. All reagents \\(except enzymes) must be pulse-vortexed and spun down in a minifuge before addition to the brew. Add enzyme last. Mix enzyme by gently flicking the tube then spin down in a minifuge before addition to the brew.\n9. After addition of all of the components, pulse-vortex the brew multiple times to assure an even distribution of all components. Quick spin the brew in a minifuge and keep it on ice.\n10. Working on ice, aliquot 40uL/well of the Lysis brew \\(4uL X 8 rows + extra) into\nrow A\nof a fresh AB 1400L 96-well reservoir plate. Seal the plate with EdgeBio cover and spin down at 3000rpm for 1min, 4\u00b0C. \u00a0 Keep the plate on ice. This plate will be used as a reservoir \\(label the plate\n\u201cRV\u201d\nand mark the row).\n11. Retrieve 384-well single cell sample plate from the -80\u00b0C freezer and spin it down for 2 minutes at 3000rpm at 4\u02daC. Place the plate on ice. Mark the rows and columns that contain samples.\n12. Working on ice, using a P20 multichannel pipette, add 4uL/well of Lysis buffer into each sample well of the 384-well plate \\(according to plate layout \u2013 quadrant A only). After each row addition, pipette up and down 10 times to mix. Try not to create bubbles. Change tips between rows. If there is a re-arrangement of well locations - note the changes in your lab book.\n13. Seal the\n\u201cRV\u201d\nplate with a EdgeBio cover and save it for later. Seal the 384-well sample plate with EdgeBio cover and spin down at 3000 rpm, 4\u00b0C for 1min.\n14. Working on ice, using P20 multichannel pipette set to 6 uL, transfer all 4 uL from each sample well into a new LoBind 96-well plate except M1, M3, O1, O3, label this plate \u201c\nscPBAL DNA\n\u201d. In the new LoBind 96-well plate, make sure to leave 4 wells empty for 3 negative controls \\(G2, H1 and H2) and one positive HL60 gDNA control \\(G1).\n15. To the 3 negative control wells: G2, H1, and H2 add 4ul of Lysis buffer \\(take the buffer from the Lysis buffer reservoir plate). Leave G1 well empty.\n16. Seal the 96-well sample plate with a\nBioRad\nPCR cover using MicroAmp adhesive film applicator as follows:\n16.1. After placing the PCR cover on, using adhesive film applicator apply firm pressure to press the cover onto the plate.\n16.2. Run the applicator firmly from left to right several times. Run the applicator up and down several times. Create a good seal around each well.\n16.3. Run the edge of the applicator around the border to seal the edge wells.\n16.4. Repeat the left to right and up and down motions to assure a good final seal.\n16.5. Inspect each well to make sure that each well edge is imprinted on the PCR cover.\nNote: Using the applicator's edge to seal between the wells is NOT recommended. It may actually pull the seal off the wells.\n17. Spin the plate at 3000 rpm, 4\u00b0C for 1min.

Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos3 and transfer the DNA from the \u201csc-PBAL DNA\u201d plate at Pos6 to the \u2018Binding + Beads\u2019 plate at Pos4 and mix. The tips will then be returned to Pos3.\n14.2. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos2 and aliquot ethanol from reservoir \\(pos9) into ethanol plate \\(pos8). You will need to pause the program when the tips are hovering above Pos9 to pour the fresh 80% ethanol into the reservoir. After Bravo aliquot ethanol, the tips will then be returned to Pos2. \u00a0 Pause the program and cover the ethanol plate at Pos8 right after Bravo drop all the tips into tip box to prevent evaporation.\nNote:\nThe evaporation in the BSC is very intense and the ethanol concentration is critical to DNA recovery. Thus, the ethanol cannot be without a cover for any extended period of time.\n15. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos3 and mix the \u2018Beads + Binding\u2019 plate at Pos4 again. The tips will then be returned to Pos3. Wait until the tips are returned before covering the \u2018Beads + Binding\u2019 plate.\n16. Bravo will then incubate the DNA with the beads for another 8 minutes \\(total 10 min).\n17. After incubation, Bravo will prompt you to move the \u2018Beads + Binding\u2019 plate from Pos4 to the magnet at Pos5.\n17.1. Before clicking \u2018Continue\u2019, place the plate on the magnet at Pos5 and incubate for two minutes \\(set a timer).\n17.2. Click \u2018Continue\u2019 and the Bravo will incubate the plate on the magnet for 3.5 minutes set.\nNote:\nThis solution is very viscous and this additional time is necessary to allow all of the beads to settle on the magnet. This will help ensure we recover as much DNA as possible.\n18. Next, Bravo will prompt you to remove the reservoir from the Pos9 and replace it with a 96 well deep-well reservoir \\(Waste), and to remove the DNA plate from Pos6 and replace it with the\nUV-treated Desulphonation buffer plate.\n19. Next, Bravo will remove the binding and lysis buffer from DNA Plate \\(Pos5):\n19.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos3 and remove all of the liquid from the DNA plate \\(\u2018Binding + Beads\u2019 plate) at Pos5. Pause the protocol when Bravo hovers above Pos5 and uncover the plate. \u00a0 The tips will then be returned to Pos3.\nNote:\nBe sure to check that all of the liquid has been aspirated as the ethanol percentage is critical in the subsequent steps.\n20. Next, Bravo will perform two 80% ethanol washes and add desulphonation buffer:\n20.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos2 and then aspirate 80% ethanol from Pos8. \u00a0 Pause the protocol when the Bravo machine hovers above Pos8 to remove the cover on the ethanol plate \\(Pos8).\n20.2. The ethanol will be gently dispensed into the DNA plate \\(Pos5).\n20.3. Bravo will let the ethanol solution and the beads incubate for 30 seconds before aspirating all of the liquid from the wells \\(Pos5) and dispensing the waste fluid at Pos9.\n20.4. Bravo will then perform a second identical ethanol wash.\n20.5. After the waste from the 2\nnd\nethanol wash is dispensed at Pos9, pause the protocol when the Bravo hovers above the desulphonation plate \\(Pos6). Remove the desulphonation plate cover \\(Pos6) and cover the ethanol plate \\(Pos8).\n20.6. Bravo will retrieve 60uL of desulphonation buffer from Pos6 and dispense it into the DNA plate at Pos5. The tips will then be returned to Pos2.\n21. Bravo will incubate the DNA with the desulphonation buffer for 15 minutes.\nCover the DNA plate \\(Pos5).\n22. After the 15 minutes incubation, Bravo will prompt with a pop-up message. Follow the instructions and remove the plate cover on Pos5 before clicking \u2018Continue\u2019.\n23. Bravo will discard the waste fluid and perform two ethanol washes:\n23.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos2 and then aspirate the used desulphonation buffer from Pos5 and discard the waste fluid at Pos9.\n23.2. Bravo will then aspirate 80% ethanol from Pos8 to perform the first wash. Pause the protocol when the Bravo machine hovers above Pos8 to remove the cover on the ethanol plate \\(Pos8).\n23.3. The ethanol will be gently dispensed onto the DNA plate \\(Pos5).\n23.4. Bravo will let the ethanol solution and the beads incubate for 30 seconds before aspirating all of the liquid from the wells \\(Pos5) and dispensing the waste fluid at Pos9.\n23.5. Bravo will then perform a second identical ethanol wash.\n23.6. After the waste from the 2\nnd\nethanol wash is discarded, let the DNA plate dry for one minute uncovered \\(start a timer for one minute). The tips will then be returned to Pos2.\n23.7. Cover the DNA plate \\(Pos5) when the timer alarm goes off and let the DNA dry \\(covered) for two additional minutes.\n24. While the beads are drying, replace the plate at Pos6 with your UV-treated QEB plate.\n25. After two minutes, Bravo will prompt you with a pop-up message. Remove the cover on the QEB plate \\(Pos6) before clicking \u2018Continue\u2019.\n26. Bravo will then add 15uL of QEB \\(Pos6) to your DNA plate \\(Pos4):\n26.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos1 and aspirate 15uL of QEB from Pos6.\n26.2. Pause the protocol when the Bravo hovers above Pos4 to dispense the QEB. Remove the cover from the DNA plate and move the plate from Pos5\u00e0Pos4.\n26.3. Bravo will dispense the QEB into the DNA plate at Pos4 and mix to resuspend the beads.\n27. After the beads are re-suspended in EB buffer, cover the plate with a BioRad PCR cover and place the plate in the Eppendorf thermomixer at 56\u02daC for 15 minutes at 2000 rpm \\(according to pop-up message). Tape the plate down to the incubator to prevent the plate from flying off.\n27.1.

Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos2 and aliquot ethanol from the reservoir \\(Pos9) into the ethanol plate \\(Pos8). \u00a0 Pause the program when the machine hovers above Pos9 to pour the fresh 70% Ethanol into the reservoir. The tips will be returned to Pos2 after the last of the ethanol is aliquoted.\n24.2. After ethanol aliquoting, pause the program and cover the ethanol plate at Pos8.\n25. The program will then incubate the DNA plate with the beads for 8 minutes \\(10 minutes total).\n26. After incubation, the program will prompt you to put the plate on the magnet and replace the ethanol reservoir from Pos9 with an empty Axygen 450 waste plate.\n26.1. Place the plate on the magnet at Pos5 and incubate for 5 minutes.\nNote:\nCheck the walls of the wells to ensure that all of the liquid is at the bottom of the well before placing the plate on the magnet. Spin for 3-4s in the centrifuge if this condition is not met.\n27. Next, Bravo will remove the waste fluid from the DNA plate \\(Pos5).\n27.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos3 and proceed to remove all of the liquid from the DNA plate at Pos5. Pause the protocol when Bravo hovers above Pos5 and uncover the plate.\n27.2. Bravo will dispense the waste fluid at Pos9. The tips will then be returned to Pos3.\n28. Next, Bravo will perform two 70% ethanol washes.\n28.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos2 and then aspirate 70% ethanol from Pos8. Pause the protocol when the Bravo machine hovers above Pos8 to remove the cover on the ethanol plate \\(Pos8).\n28.2. The ethanol will be gently dispensed into the DNA plate \\(Pos5).\n28.3. Bravo will let the ethanol solution and the beads incubate for 30 seconds before aspirating all of the liquid from the wells \\(Pos5) and dispensing the waste fluid at Pos9.\n28.4. Bravo will then perform a second identical ethanol wash.\n28.5. After the waste from the 2\nnd\nethanol wash is dispensed at Pos9, set a timer for one minute. The tips will then be returned to Pos2.\n29. When the timer alarms, cover the plate \\(Pos5) and let the plate dry for two additional minutes.\nNote:\nBefore continuing, inspect the reaction plate to make sure that all of the traces of ethanol are evaporated. The beads should be completely dry but not cracked. Make sure the beads are not over-dried as that reduces DNA recovery.\n30. Next, Bravo will prompt you to move the DNA plate from Pos5 to Pos4 and to place the QEB plate at Pos6. Do not move the DNA plate yet, but place the QEB plate at Pos6. Remove the cover on the QEB plate and click \u2018Continue\u2019.\n31. The program will then add 35 uL QEB \\(Pos6) to the DNA plate \\(Pos4) and incubate for a minimum of four minutes.\n31.1.

After the EB buffer has been added and mixed with dried beads pause the program and in a 2.0mL tube prepare the End-repair master mix according to the following calculator:\n33. All reagents \\(except enzymes) must be pulse-vortexed and spin down in a minifuge before addition to the brew. \u00a0 Enzymes should be added last. \u00a0 When ready to add the enzymes, pulse-vortex the end repair master mix multiple times, then spin down in a minifuge, and place back on ice.\n34. Remove the enzymes from -20\u00b0C freezer and place them in the chilled tube cool rack for transport to the PCR workstation. Mix each enzyme by flicking the tube, then spin down in a minifuge and place it back in the chilled tube cool rack.\n35. When pipetting the enzyme, aspirate slowly to assure an accurate volume transfer. Enzyme storage buffers contain glycerol, which makes the solution more viscous than water. After dispensing the enzyme into the brew, wash the tip by pipetting up and down.\nNote:\nNever double dip into the solution with the same tip.\n36. After enzyme addition place the brew immediately back on ice. Return the enzymes back into the -20\u00b0C freezer before proceeding.\n37. Gently pulse-vortex the brew multiple times to assure an even distribution of all of the components. Pulse-vortexing means that you stop vortexing every time a full vortex is formed in the tube. Spin down the brew in a minifuge and immediately place it back on ice.\n38. Working on ice, aliquot 143 uL of the mix into one 12-well strip tube.\n39. Change the tip box at position 2 on Bravo and pause the program and update the tip editor with Box-position2.\n40.

The tips will then be returned to Pos1.\n12.4. Cover the DNA plate \\(Pos4) when the machine is no longer in motion.\n13. While waiting for the protocol, prepare the PCR mastermix in a tube and aliquot into one row of a new 96-well plate. Label this the \u201creservoir\u201d plate.\n14. Prepare the PCR brew in a 5 mL tube according to the following calculator:\n15. Aliquot 211 uL of the mix into one 12-well strip tube.\n16. Change the tip box at position 2 on Bravo. Pause the program and update the tip editor with Box-position2.\n17. Place the master mix strip-tube on row A of a chilled cool-rack at position 7 on Bravo.\n18. Place a LoBind plate on a chilled cool-rack at position 6 on Bravo.\n19. Place the elution plate back on the Bravo deck: on top of the magnet in position 5.\n20. The robot will first aliquot the master mix brew from the 12-well strip tube into the new LoBind plate 23 uL/well at position 6. Then it will transfer \\(Pos5) the elute DNA 25 uL/well into the brew plate \\(Pos6) and mix.\n21. Using a P20 multichannel pipette, manually add 2 uL of the index primer from the Indexing Primer plate to each reaction. Label this plate \u201cPCR.\u201d\n22. Spin down the plate at 3000rpm, 4C, for 2min.\n23. Incubate the \u201cPCR\u201d plate in the thermocycler using the program pcr-gsc using 7 cycles. Check the cycle number and setting before starting PCR.\npcr-gsc program:\n98\u00b0C for 1 minute\n98\u00b0C for 30 seconds\n65\u00b0C for 15 seconds\n70\u00b0C for 15 seconds\n70\u00b0C for 5 minutes\n4\u00b0C forever\nBead cleanup after PCR\n1. Aliquot 50 uL of beads into each well of the \u201cbeads\u201d plate. Do NOT use a reservoir for this step as the beads will settle and the PEG concentration will not be consistent.\n2. Set up the bravo exactly as stated in Bead-Cleanup and End-Repair \\(step 7) except with the following parameters:\nDNA volume = 50 uL\nBead volume = 45 uL\nElution volume = 27 uL\n3. The program will add the beads \\(Pos6) to the DNA plate \\(Pos4).\n3.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from Pos3 and transfer 50uL of beads from Pos6 to the DNA plate at Pos4 and mix. The tips will then be returned to Pos3.\n3.2. Pause the protocol and cover the DNA plate.\n4. The program will aliquot the ethanol into the 96 well reservoir \\(Pos9\u00e0Pos8)\n4.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos2 and aliquot ethanol from the reservoir \\(Pos9) into the ethanol plate \\(Pos8). Pause the program when the machine hovers above Pos9 to pour the fresh 70% Ethanol into the reservoir. The tips will be returned to Pos2 after the last of the ethanol is aliquoted.\n4.2. Pause the program and cover the ethanol plate at Pos8.\n5. The program will then incubate the DNA plate with the beads for 8 minutes \\(10 minutes total).\n6. After incubation, the program will prompt you to put the plate on the magnet and replace the ethanol reservoir from Pos9 with an empty Axygen 450 waste plate.\n6.1. Place the plate on the magnet at Pos5 and incubate for two minutes \\(set a timer).\n6.2. Click \u2018Continue\u2019 when the timer alarms and incubate for an additional 3.5 minutes.\nNote:\nCheck the walls of the wells to ensure that all of the liquid is at the bottom of the well before placing the plate on the magnet. Spin for 3-4s in the centrifuge if this condition is not met.\n7. Next, Bravo will remove the waste fluid from the DNA plate \\(Pos5).\n7.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos3 and proceed to remove all of the liquid from the DNA plate at Pos5. Pause the protocol when Bravo hovers above Pos5 and uncover the plate.\n7.2. Bravo will dispense the waste fluid at Pos9. The tips will then be returned to Pos3.\n8. Next, Bravo will perform two 70% ethanol washes.\n8.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos2 and then aspirate 70% ethanol from Pos8. \u00a0 Pause the protocol when the Bravo machine hovers above Pos8 to remove the cover on the ethanol plate \\(Pos8).\n8.2. The ethanol will be gently dispensed into the DNA plate \\(Pos5).\n8.3. Bravo will let the ethanol solution and the beads incubate for 30 seconds before aspirating all of the liquid from the wells \\(Pos5) and dispensing the waste fluid at Pos9.\n8.4. Bravo will then perform a second identical ethanol wash.\n8.5. After the waste from the 2\nnd\nethanol wash is dispensed at Pos9, set a timer for one minute. The tips will then be returned to Pos2.\n9. When the timer alarms, cover the plate \\(Pos5) and let the plate dry for two additional minutes.\nNote:\nBefore continuing, inspect the reaction plate to make sure that all of the traces of ethanol are evaporated. The beads should be completely dry but not cracked. Make sure the beads are not over-dried as that reduces DNA recovery.\n10. Next, Bravo will prompt you to move the DNA plate from Pos5 to Pos4 and to place the QEB plate at Pos6. Do not move the DNA plate yet, but place the QEB plate at Pos6. Remove the cover on the QEB plate and click \u2018Continue\u2019.\n11. The program will then add 27 uL QEB \\(Pos6) to the DNA plate \\(Pos4) and incubate for a minimum of four minutes.\n11.1. Bravo will retrieve tips from the tip box at Pos1 and aspirate QEB from Pos6.\n11.2. Bravo will then dispense the QEB into the DNA plate at Pos4. \u00a0 Pause the protocol when the machine hovers above Pos4. Uncover the DNA plate \\(Pos5) and move it to Pos4.\n11.3. The tips will then be returned to Pos1.\n11.4. While the DNA is eluting, cover the DNA plate \\(Pos4) when the machine is no longer in motion.\n11.5. After the incubation for the DNA elution is over, spin the plate for 10-20 seconds in plate centrifuge.\n11.6. Place the plate on the magnet \\(Pos5) and uncover the plate.\n12. Place a new \\(labelled) LoBind plate at Pos6. Bravo should elute the supernatant directly into new plate.\n13. Cover the plate with a plastic cover, spin down at 2000g for 1min, 4\u00b0C. \u00a0 Proceed to the next step or seal with an aluminum cover and store at -20\u02daC.\nqPCR QC\n1.

Clean up your workstation. Remove garbage. This concludes Day 3 of this protocol.\nDAY 4\nqPCR Analysis, sample pooling and precipitation\n1. Analyze qPCR data using\nqPCR pipeline.Rmd\nfollowing instructions.\n1.1. instructions:\n# 1. Change the title to desired file name\n# 2. Select the correct excel file \\(press tab betwene quotes, choose from the list)\n# 3. Make sure the wells are defined \\(positive, negative, tencell,hundredcell)\n# 4. Set cutoff to be between 8-10\n# 5. Press \"Knit HTML\"\n# 6. View the plot, if needed, adjust cut off value slightly\n# 7. Press \"Knit HTML\" again\n# 8. Check through figures, save/print results and confirm correct file names\n# 9. Upload to JIRA, under the appropriate library construction ticket\n\\`\\`\\`\n1.2. Define a cutoff for success\nSuccessful passed samples will cluster well in plot figure, the cutoff should be set right above the clustered plots. For example:\n1.3. Check that there are no systematic errors with the plate\n2. Percentage of passed samples should be above 75-80%. Check that the average CT values of the passed wells is consistent with previous sample plates \\(Target and Library).\nNote: Average CT value for Target should be between 21-23, average CT value for Library should be between 13-15. Delta CT between Target_Ct and Library_Ct should be between 6-9.\n3. Working on ice, pool all of the passed wells and negative controls together into a 2mL tube. Exclude failed wells and positive controls \\(usually G1 or as marked).\n4. Measure the total volume and, working on ice, set up ethanol precipitation as follows:\nX \\(volume pooled in uL)\n0.1*X of 3M Sodium Acetate pH 5.5 \\(in uL)\n5. Mix well by pulse-vortexing. \u00a0 Add 1.3 uL mussel glycogen \\(marked as MG, 20mg/mL) and mix well by pulse-vortexing.\n6. Calculate the total volume and add 2.5X\\(total volume in uL) of cold 100% ethanol.\u00a0\u00a0 Vortex thoroughly. It is important that the solution is very well mixed. Split the volume across multiple 1.5mL tubes.\n7. Incubate precipitations at -20\u02daC for at least 2 hour but overnight is preferred.\n8. While waiting, pre-chill the centrifuge to 4\u02daC.\n9. After -20\u02daC incubation, place all tubes in the same orientation in the pre-chilled to 4\u00b0C centrifuge.\n10. Spin down at 15,000g \\(max rpm) at 4\u00b0C, for 40 min.\n11. Prepare fresh 70% ethanol using ultrapure water. Take out and aliquot of 20% PEG SeraMag beads to warm up to room temperature for at least 30 min.\nNote:\nThe following steps must be performed on ice.\n12. After centrifugation visually locate the pellet. Carefully discard the supernatant while avoiding the DNA pellet.\n13. Add 1mL of 70% ethanol, plate the tube inside the centrifuge in the same orientation as before, and spin down at 15000g \\(max rpm) at 4\u00b0C, for 4 min.\n14. After centrifugation visually locate the pellet and carefully aspirate the supernatant.\n15. Spin down the tube in minifuge to collect all of the ethanol on the bottom. With P10 remove the final traces of ethanol.\n16. Dry the pellet at room temperature until the pellet becomes translucent \\(maximum 5 minutes).\nKeep a close eye on the pellets so that they do not over-dry.\n17. When the pellet becomes clear, resuspend the DNA in each tube with 20 uL of room temperature EB buffer. \u00a0 Mix up and down with the pipette.\n18. After the pellets are fully dissolved, pool all volume into one tube. Measure the volume and top up with EB buffer to a multiple of 50uL. \u00a0 For example, if the volume is 80uL add an additional 20uL of EB buffer to a total volume 100uL \\(which is 2X 50uL).\nLibrary pool purification using SeraMag beads\n1. Make sure that the 20% SeraMag beads have fully reached room temperature before proceeding and use freshly made \\(on the same day) 70% ethanol.\n2. Working at post PCR work station, using a single channel P100, aliquot the pooled and precipitated single cell PCR library products - 50uL per well into one row of a new LoBind plate.\n3. Mix the 20% SeraMag beads very well and aliquot 55ul per well into one row of a reservoir plate \\(corresponding to the number of DNA wells). \u00a0 Using P200 multichannel, to each 50uL of DNA add 45uL of room temperature 20%PEG SeraMag beads \\(0.9X ratio) and immediately mix by pipetting up and down at least 10X.\n4. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\n5. After 10min incubation move the plate to the magnet and incubate for 3 min. Make sure that all of the beads are separated to the sides and the solution is completely clear before proceeding.\n6. Keep the plate on the magnet for the next few steps.\n7. Without disturbing the beads, using a single channel P200, carefully remove the clear supernatant. Make sure not to remove any beads.\n8. On the magnet, using multichannel P200, add 150ul of 70% ethanol and incubate for 30 seconds.\n9. From each well, carefully aspirate the ethanol using single channel P200.\n10. Using multichannel P200, add 150uL 70% ethanol and incubate for 30 seconds.\n11. From each well, using single channel P200 set to 170uL, carefully remove all of the ethanol.\n12. After the second wash keep the plate still on the magnet. Using P10 aspirate the remaining traces of ethanol from the bottom of each well. \u00a0 Make sure not to remove any beads,\n13. Let the beads dry at room temperature for 2 min. Do not over-dry the beads. You should not see any cracks.\n14. When the beads are dry, remove the plate from the magnet. Using P20, add 15uL of EB buffer and mix very well by pipetting up and down. \u00a0 Make sure that all of the beads are re-suspended. The solution should be uniformly brown.\n15. Incubate at room temperature for 3min.\n16. After 3min elution, place the plate back onto the magnet and incubate for 1 min. Make sure that all of the beads are pulled to the sides and the solution is completely clear.\n17. After 1min incubation, using P20 carefully transfer the supernatant \\(containing the eluted DNA) into a new 1.5 mL tube. Label the tube with sample/pool ID.\n18. Use 1uL of the sample for Qubit assay and run another 1uL on HS Agilent to observe the fragment distribution. Expected yield should be > 1 ng/uL. Average size of the final product should be around 300bp.\n19. Store the sample at -20C until ready for sequencing. \u00a0 Record all of the data in your notebook.\n20. Clean up your workstation. Remove garbage. This concludes Day 4 of this protocol."
