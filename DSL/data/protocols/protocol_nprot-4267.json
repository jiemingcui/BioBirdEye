            "content": "_Piriformospora_ _indica_ is a mycorhhiza like fungus forming association with a broad spectrum of terrestrial plants<sup>1,2,3</sup>. It confers resistance to the host from both the abiotic as well as biotic stress. It belongs to the order Sebacinales within Hymenomycetes<sup>4</sup>. The order Sebacinales includes a variety of mycorrhizal fungi like _P._ _indica_ having plant growth promotional attributes<sup>5</sup>. However, as a rhizospheric microorganism, _P._ _indica_ forms association with multiple partners providing agronomic benefits and creating a stable ecological niche. _P._ _indica_ developed systemic resistance in barley seedlings in association with _Rhizobium_  _radiobacter_<sup>6</sup>. Its interaction with several Alpha Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria reveal stimulatory to inhibitory mode of interaction in terms of the fungal growth<sup>4</sup>. _Azotobacter_ _chroococcum_ a free living plant growth promoting rhizobacterium \\(PGPR) is a  potential fungal growth stimulant. Inoculation of _A._ _chroococcum_ along with Glomus fasciculatum profoundly increased fungal sporulation and enhanced growth of tomato plants<sup>7</sup>. Rice plant biomass was found to be significantly higher when it was co-infected with _A._ _chroococcum_ and _P._ _indica_ in comparison with either single inoculants<sup>8</sup>. Rhizospheric interaction is very dynamic and complex. Though the synergistic interaction between _A._ _chroococcum_ and AM fungi is well known, it has bee difficult to maintain sustained interaction and study the underlying mechanism. However, several attempts have been made to elucidate the role of mycorrhiza helper bacteria \\(MHB) in stimulating the fungal growth. Transcriptomic analysis of an ectomycorrhizal - _Laccaria_ _bicolor_  in interaction with MHB did reveal genes involved in cell to cell interaction and stress response with bacteria<sup>9</sup>. However, the role of bacteria in modulating the fungal physiology and its possible consequence in terms of agronomic benefits has not yet been elucidated. We are the first group to study the effect of rhizospheric bacteria on the growth and physiology of endophytic fungus like _P._ _indica_ in terms of proteomics<sup>10</sup>. With such study we hope to develop an understanding of the microbial relationships. The synergistic interaction of _P._ _indica_ and _A._ _chroococcum_ might offer a potential biofertilizer for sustainable agriculture.\r\n\n\nIn this study, the effect of _A._ _chroococcum_ on growth and physiology of _P._ _indica_ was studied with respect to fungal cellular proteins. A clean protein preparation is a critical for high resolution of two dimensional gel electrophoresis \\(2-DE) and protein analyses. There is no universal protocol for protein extraction that can be applied for all kinds of organisms for 2-DE. Protein extraction and sample preparation are challenging steps in global proteomic study, which have significant impact on the quality of isoelectric focusing \\(IEF) gel electrophoresis in the second dimension and on the mass spectrometry. Protein preparation from fungi like _P._ _indica_ is difficult, not only because fungal mycelia are refractile to common methods of lysis in aqueous buffers but also because they contain various interfering substances like thick polysaccharides, polyphenols, lipids, organic acids, alkaloids and other secondary metabolites.The interfering compounds can cause horizontal and vertical streaking and smearing and reduce the number of distinctly resolved protein spots in 2-DE gels<sup>11,12</sup>. Earlier published protocols for protein extraction from other fungi,<sup>13,14</sup> as such are not adaptable and needed to be optimized for _P._ _indica_.\r\n\n\nThe main objective of this study was to established a protein extraction protocol suitable for 2DE and proteomic analysis of _P._ _indica_. We used modified TCA in acetone precipitation method for extraction of _P._ _indica_ cellular proteins. The extracted proteins were concentrated, assayed for protein yield and separated in a 2D-gel electrophoresis system \\(Bio Rad) using pH gradient of 3-10. The number of protein spots was analyzed by using Progenesis Same Spots image analysis software. The present protocol may as well be applicable for other endophytic fungi."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "_Piriformospora_ _indica_ is a mycorrhiza like fungus of the order Sebacinales,which colonizes root and forms symbiosis with almost all terrestrial plants on earth. Information about the _P._ _indica_ quantitative proteomics is limited.This limits our understanding of its multitrophic interaction with plants. A quantitative proteomic analysis of the fungus vis a vis its interaction with rhizospheric bacteria and the plant can reflect on the underlying proteins/enzymes. We describe a protocol for efficient extraction of cellular proteins from the fungus for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis following interaction with _Azotobacter_ _chroococcum_ in axenic culture. Polysaccharides and abundant salts present in Hill and Kaefer broth hinders extraction of protein from fungal biomass. Good quantity and quality of proteins are required for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and proteomic analysis. We could use the extracts for proteomic analysis following a high resolution of  2-DE reference map of the fungus after interaction with _A. chroococcum_.",
