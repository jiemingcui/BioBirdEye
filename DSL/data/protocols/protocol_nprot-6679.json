            "content": "Advances in optic devices and microscopes enable us to visualize micro- and nano-scale range of objects. In particular, the upgradations in imaging algorithms and softwares allow to get more appropriate images or data from various experiments. Since the architecture of Langerhans islet is unique, studying pancreatic islets with microscopes must consider its three-dimensional \\(3D) structure<sup>1</sup>. This difference in islet structure needed an alternate quantifying method, rather than assessing islet viability with fluorescence dyes on 2D images. Recently, advanced methods have been studied for staining methods and fluorescence dyes<sup>2, 3</sup>. In addition, some experimental protocols have already been established to manually determine the scoring of islet viability.<sup>4, 5</sup> Although several fluorescence-based staining protocols suggests their accuracy and immediacy, it is still ambiguous to quantify cell viability, especially in the 3D culture. Thus, approach to numerical assessment of islet viability with computer vision is timely required in order to properly describe the characteristics of objects.<sup>6</sup> In this protocol, we focused on the architecture of pancreatic islet, which is rugged sphere shaped and composition of different kinds of constitutive cells including \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4 cells.<sup>7</sup>\r\n\n\nParticularly, this protocol described the pancreatic islet viability assessment based on color pixel intensity analysis. A widely used two color fluorescence dye viability kit, LIVE/DEAD\u2122 Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells, was used. This kit works via two probes, calcein acetoxymethyl \\(calcein AM) with esterase activity, and ethidium homodimer \\(EthD-1) with plasma membrane.<sup>8</sup> After the staining process, confocal laser scanning microscopy \\(LSM 510 META, AxioObserver, Carl Zeiss) was carried out to qualitatively capture the images of islet. By setting the excitation wavelength at 488 nm for EthD-1 and 543 nm for calcein AM, data was collected from LSM with emission wavelength at 518 nm and 588 nm, respectively. It was followed by converting the binary images to colored images by painting live cells with green and dead cells with red, and then subsequently stacking multiple images along the z-axis to represent the 3D structure of islet. Finally, the converted image was processed to average projection of voxels \\(3D pixels)<sup>9</sup>, since existing methods in just 2D plane cannot represent the 3D architecture of islets.<sup>10</sup> Contrary to the preceding protocols that quantify these images manually with naked eye<sup>4, 11-13</sup>, here we suggest a protocol and its related algorithm for quantitatively analyzing islet viability with the obtained images from LIVE/DEAD\u2122 assay. Additionally, a prototype of islet viability operating software was developed based on computer vision library, named OpenCV. It generates the numerical values by combining the existing cell detection algorithms, color space conversion to luminance sensitive CIE L<sup>**</sup>a<sup>**</sup>b<sup>*</sup>, and intensity analysis with split color channel histograms. \r\n\n\nMore specifically, the program includes the following functions and processes \\(Figure 1). In the first step, a copy of the original image is converted to the mask \\(binary image) through step-by-step imaging processes containing Gaussian blur, color space conversion, threshold and morphological process. In these steps, the program removes background clearly. Two existing methods, threshold with Gaussian blur and morphological processing were adapted. Gaussian blur is essential process to remove the image noises and to smoothen the border lines. It enables users to detect cell contours easily and to remove the background fluorescence of the materials in solution. The threshold in CIE L<sup>**</sup>a<sup>**</sup>b<sup>*</sup> color space is similar to the high-pass luminance filter that processes the image by lower intensity boundary value given by the user. Finally, morphological process removes negligible size of islets \\(mostly far away from ROIs in z-axis) and impurities. After processing the mask image, the mask and the original image are bitwise operated and combined into one implying the clear removal of the background and small impurities. Following to it, implicit pixel data from the thresholded image is calculated to obtain the average intensity, contours of islets, and red/green color histogram. Finally, the numerical islet viability result is displayed on the user interface.\r\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6675/original/figure1.bmp?1526196729\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6675/thumbnail/figure1.png?1526196729\" > </a>"

Set up the channels in ZEN with the wavelength values of the fluorescence dye \\(the information is available in the manual of the kit). There will be only two channels, since the kit contains two staining probes.\r\n  2. Activate the \u2018Z-stack\u2019 checkbox in the Acquisition dimensions.\r\n  3. Select \u2018Z-stack tool\u2019 in the Multidimensional Acquisition tool group. Open the tool.\r\n  4. Set all values in the tool. Then click Start Auto Configuration. \\(You can also do this step manually)\r\n  5. Click on the Start Experiment button to start the experiment. The z-stack image will be provided with merged version, if not, merge the images from individual channels manually. \r\n  6. Set live-channel with green color and dead-channel with red color.\r\n  7. Move to Processing tab on the category. Find Orthogonal Projection and click on it.\r\n  8. Change Method Parameters tab to Average for general projection view. The consideration depends on the cell environment or gain factor that is used during the exposure, hence try both options and select better one. \r\n  _CAUTION\\!_ Make sure that the Thickness tab should include all of planar images.\r\n\n\n9. Click Max/Min button in Display window under the image overview. This process will revise red and green color intensity.\r\n  10. After the conversion, find Image Export in Method category. Export the image in proper format. The formats jpeg, jpg and JPEG XR are not recommended.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**How to run NIVA.exe with the image**\r\n\n\n11. Run NIVA.exe in your computer.\r\n  12. Load your image in the program. Supporting image formats are jpg, jpeg, bmp, png, tif and tiff. \r\n  _CAUTION\\!_ Although .jpg and .jpeg image file formats are available in this program, for the accurate image process, they are not recommended to use.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Image processing in NIVA.exe**\r\n\n\n13. Increase LowL value in the trackbar included in Values groupbox. The program will automatically blur and threshold the image. The LowL value stands for lower boundary intensity value in thresholding process \\(Figure 2).\n14. Once the LowL value is manipulated in step 13, the image that is loaded at the beginning will be changed in real-time. Observe the changed image in the program and find the appropriate values.\r\n  15. In step 14, gray colored contours will be shown in the image. Try to figure out the desired region of interest \\(ROI) with the contours.\r\n  16. Increase the Morph value in order to erase small objects that is to be disregarded. This will execute morphological process with n by n matrix, with a size of the value and the ellipse-like shapes \\(Figure 3).\n17. Click Calculate button in the groupbox. Then the respective percentage of red and green pixels will appear, as well as the normalized histogram \\(Figure 4).\n_CAUTION\\!_ Since both vertical and horizontal axis was normalized, the scale of red and green line is different.\r\n\n\n18. To obtain the accurate and reliable results, repeat the steps at least 5 times per each islet samples and use the average value to assess islet viability."

Then, please check your operating system if it can support all Windows functions, because the program also uses .dll files in Win 32.\r\n\n\nStep 13: If the image doesn\u2019t change while changing the LowL value, try to release your mouse cursor on the trackbar. The program only recognizes a change of the value when the trackbar has been completely released.\r\n\n\nStep 18: If you have a lag while using the program, just try to restart program.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "The LIVE/DEAD viability assay is a widely applied technique to validate the qualitative analysis of viable pancreatic islet, and the scoring has to be done to quantify the image data manually. However, it is often associated with variations due to subjective judgment. In this protocol, the ultimate purpose of the developed software entitled \u201cNumerical Islet Viability Assay \\(NIVA)\u201d is to provide numerical information of islet viability via z-stack image from confocal laser scanning microscopy. The developed software can detect three dimensional structure of each islet with color voxels of them. OpenCVSharp was used with CSharp \\(C#) code to access color pixel value of the image and to process them followed by displaying the results on user interface. The protocol starts with an introduction of how to get z-stack image from ZEN \\(blue edition, Carl Zeiss), and the use of program NIVA.exe to gain islet viability based on the computer vision. Then, the manipulating guide for adjusting values and the examples of a sample are described. The result shows that the respective percentage of red and green color pixel values obtained across z-axis are computed through normalized histograms and numerical digits. This protocol will provide how to use this program, especially manipulating user-adjustable values and finding optimal values for analyzing islet viability. The data can be used for validating cell viability, or cytotoxicity during cell culture by using resultant image from the general LIVE/DEAD viability assay.",
