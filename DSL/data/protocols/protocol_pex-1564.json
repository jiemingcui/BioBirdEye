        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>To gain insights into tissue-specific gene expression in multicellular systems, gene expression profiles are required to be precisely linked with spatial information. Here, we establish a hight-depth spatial transcriptomics method, photo-isolation chemistrty (PIC), which is able to isolate gene expression profiles only from UV-irradiatied region out of whole tissue section. This method performs reverse transcription on tissue sections using photocaged oligo DNAs. After the UV irradiation, the cDNAs in the irradiated regions are allowed to be amplified and sequenced, thereby&nbsp;providing gene expression profiles linked with spatial information.</p>",
