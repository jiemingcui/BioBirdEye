            "content": "<p>Tick-borne infections such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis are a global public health burden.&nbsp;There may be 600,000 cases of Lyme disease in the United States and Europe each year<sup>1</sup> and this zoonosis may continue to emerge in new sites. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our capacity to develop effective control measures relies on understanding the transmission cycle of these pathogens in nature and the mode of human exposure.&nbsp;Because tickborne agents generally require mammalian or avian hosts that ensure that the basic reproduction number exceeds 1, identifying their reservoirs (=amplification hosts) is a main focus for developing interventions.&nbsp;To date, our knowledge of the relative importance of reservoir hosts is indirectly based on tick infestation indices, prevalence of infection, and abundance of the candidate hosts.&nbsp;Our knowledge base has been greatly influenced by the relative ease with which each species is sampled as well as the investigator\u2019s preconceived expectations that shape study design.&nbsp;In contrast, host bloodmeal identification is an unbiased method for detecting the host upon which a vector has fed and acquired infection.&nbsp;Bloodmeal analysis has been a critical contributor to our understanding of &nbsp;mosquito-borne infections since the 1950s, accomplished by using simple methods such as immunoprecipitation <sup>2,3</sup>, because the life span of these arthropods is short and partially digested bloodmeals remain in the gut.&nbsp;Unfortunately, similar methods have not been shown to work for ticks.&nbsp;Bloodmeal analysis in ticks is complicated by their unique extended life-cycle and their complete intracellular digestion of blood components.&nbsp;Ixodid ticks feed only once per life stage, and therefore bloodmeal analysis in ticks attempts to detect the remnants of the bloodmeal after it has been fully digested and the tick has molted to the next stage, as much as a year later; little remains for analysis.&nbsp;Multiple methods for bloodmeal analysis in ticks have been previously published, but the reported success rate in field-collected ticks is low, often fewer than 50% of ticks tested<sup>4\u20139</sup>.&nbsp;We have recently developed a new method for tick bloodmeal identification that relies on the amplification of mammalian retrotransposons using real time PCR<sup>10,11</sup>.&nbsp;Retrotransposons are self-replicating genetic elements that leave a copy behind in the genome every time they jump to a new location.&nbsp;They have been coevolving in mammalian genomes for millions of years and have accumulated high copy numbers, often over 100,000 copies per genome.&nbsp;Thirty percent of the human genome is thought to consist of retrotransposons<sup>12</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These extreme copy numbers maximize the probability that enough target is left behind in the remnants of the fully digested bloodmeal to be detected by PCR.&nbsp;Thus, the sensitivity of this assay is much greater than previous published bloodmeal identification methods.&nbsp;Although this method is a straight-forward real time PCR, with its extreme sensitivity comes the perils of contamination and false positives.&nbsp;Here we detail our methods, much of which focuses on contamination prevention procedures, so that bloodmeal analysis in ticks can be successfully utilized for tick ecology studies by other investigators.</p>"

            "content": "Expertise needed to implement the protocol:\nThis protocol is appropriate for anyone with familiarity with routine real-time PCR reactions.\nLimitations:\nPCR amplification of retrotransposons has similar sensitivity to many methods currently used in modern forensics. The key to the successful utilization of this method is contamination prevention, more so than just ensuring that there is no carryover of material between samples during extraction or of nucleic acids during PCR setup.\u00a0Contamination may arise at any step in the process from the handling of the ticks during collection and sorting. Throughout this protocol, measures used to prevent contamination will be detailed.\u00a0These may seem \u201cover-the-top\u201d for many veteran researchers with years of experience setting up successful PCRs.\u00a0However, these measures were arrived at because problems arose in our laboratory.\u00a0Since these strict measures have been implemented, contamination has ceased to be an issue.\nThis method works best if the ticks are young and fresh.\u00a0We have found that the success of this method decreases with the age of the tick\n10\n.\u00a0Do not allow collected ticks to sit alive in incubators in the lab waiting to be processed.\u00a0Freeze the ticks soon after collection.\u00a0Because ticks are promptly killed, there is no need to put plaster or anything else in the bottom of collection tubes (which is usually done to help modulate humidity in the tubes to keep the ticks alive).\u00a0We use 3-dram snap cap vials (VWR 89097-516) for tick collections. This facilitates the ability to externally decontaminate the ticks directly in the collection tubes (see below).\u00a0Depending on local circumstances, environmental DNA (eDNA) may contaminate the exterior of questing ticks.\u00a0It is also likely that questing ticks may be contaminated by DNA from phoretic hosts\n13\n.\nI. Tick collection\nContamination prevention procedures for tick collection:\nDuring our trips to the field, we often trap animals and sample mouse boxes in addition to collecting ticks.\u00a0It is important that all equipment used for activities involving animals are kept separate from the tick-collecting equipment.\u00a0Bloodmeal identification PCRs may become positive simply from the use of contaminated forceps, such as ones that were also used to remove ticks from animals.\u00a0Use clean forceps that are dedicated to tick collections and are not used for any other task.\u00a0We routinely store our tick drags inside plastic trash bags; to keep them protected from the other equipment (such as mouse traps) that is also stored in the back of our field vehicle.\u00a0Collection tubes for ticks should also be stored separately from the tubes and other supplies used to work-up field-collected animals.\u00a0Tick drags should periodically be placed in direct sun for several hours to inactivate environmental DNA.\nII. Tick sorting and nucleic acid extraction.\nContamination prevention procedures for processing ticks in the lab:\nThe processing of the ticks must be done in an area physically separated from the PCR machines.\u00a0This area must also be free of all possible mammalian contamination.\u00a0Activities such as working next to someone extracting mouse tissues or working in a hood that is also used for mammalian tissue-cultures must be avoided.\u00a0Be aware of contaminating aerosols from centrifuges or other common equipment that have exhaust or cooling fans. The use of extraction robots may be another source of contamination, if the robot is used for diverse samples (e.g., to extract mouse blood, cell cultures, ticks, mosquitoes).\u00a0All forceps, racks, pipettors, lab benches etc\u2026should be dedicated to tick work, or at the minimum be decontaminated before use (use bleach or DNA Away (Fisher #21-236-28)).\u00a0Finally, consider your clothes.\u00a0Be mindful that fur and dander from your pets are all over your clothes and can cause contamination of the samples.\u00a0Be sure to, at the very least, wear a clean lab coat that is frequently changed.\nMaterials\n:\nFreshly diluted 5% bleach\nMolecular biology grade water (UltraPure DNase/RNase free distilled water Invitrogen #10977015)\nSnap-cap microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf #022364111)\n100 micron zirconium beads (Ops Diagnostics #BLBZ 10025014)\n1000\u00b5l pipette tips tips- heat sealed (Fisher Scientific #02-707-403)\nAerosol barrier pipette tips\nTransfer pipettes (Fisher Scientific #13-711-7M)\nGloves\nAlcohol burner (Fisher #04-245-1)\nClean forceps\nQuickExtract (Lucigen Corp.#QE09050)\nProcedure:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don clean gloves and a clean lab coat.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heat seal the tip of 1000\u00b5l pipette tips by holding them briefly in the flame of an alcohol burner.
