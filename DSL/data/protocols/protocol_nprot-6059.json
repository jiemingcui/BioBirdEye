            "content": "Glycolysis in the cytosol and oxidative phosphorylation \\(OXPHOS) in the mitochondrial inner membrane are the two major mechanisms used to produce ATP in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase \\(complex IV) uses O<sup>2</sup> in conjunction with protons as an acceptor of electron to produce H<sub>2</sub>O, whereas protons \\(H<sup>+</sup>) are released during lactate production, which occurs in non-mitochondria-linked aerobic glycolysis. Mitochondrial respiration and aerobic glycolytic activity, on the basis of the OCR and ECAR, respectively, are important parameters used to quantify mitochondrial energy metabolism in a variety of cellular contexts. Measurements of mitochondrial OCR in _Drosophila_ have been done using isolated mitochondria and permeabilized cells with a Clark-type oxygen electrode, but this assay cannot evaluate aerobic glycolytic activity at the same time <sup>1,2</sup>. Another study has employed the body wall tissues from third instar larvae to estimate the dynamic mitochondrial OXPHOS activity in a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer <sup>3</sup>. However, the OCR responses to mitochondrial respiratory complex inhibitors were blunt, since OXPHOS is not the major generator of ATP in body wall tissues, which makes it difficult to evaluate the precise mitochondrial activity of the cells _in vivo_. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn the early embryogenesis of _Drosophila_, nuclear divisions occur in the center of the eggs, and most nuclei migrate to the periphery without cell division. Cellular membranes emerge in the peripheral part of the multinucleated syncytium by 80-90 min. Then, all the periphery nuclei cellularize by 180 min. In this stage, the mitochondrial activity may be reduced <sup>4</sup>. Nevertheless, one can consistently observe the mitochondrial OCR in the embryonic cell cultures prepared from isolated blastodermal cells and the sharp responses to the mitochondrial inhibitors <sup>5</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn this protocol, we adapt the procedure of the MitoStress test to living Drosophila embryonic cells using a Seahorse XF<sup>e</sup>24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer \\(**Figure 1**). The quick preparation of staged embryonic cells is a key point of this protocol while the expression of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes can be collaterally analyzed by western blotting using residual cells to assess both the mitochondrial respiration and the mitochondrial integrity."

Hydration of a Seahorse XF\ne\n24 sensor cartridge**\r\n\n\nAdd 1.0 ml of XF calibrant solution to each well of a 24-well utility plate, cover the utility plate with the hydro-booster \\(pink spacer), and then place the sensor cartridge in the utility plate. Finally, cover the sensor cartridge with the lid. Place the sensor cartridge in a 25\u00b0C incubator to hydrate over 12 hrs.\r\n\n\n**Tip:** The sensor cartridge should be hydrated at least 12 hrs before use. In our case, we allowed the sensor cartridge to hydrate overnight \\(approximately 16 hrs). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**B. Preparation of Cell-Tak-coated microplates**\r\n\n\n1. Prepare 1.5 ml of Cell-Tak solution by dissolving 33.8 \u00b5g of Cell-Tak in the appropriate volume of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate \\(pH 8.0), and immediately add 1 M sodium hydroxide at half the volume of Cell-Tak stock solution \\(in 5% acetic acid) used to prepare a final volume of 1.5-ml solution.\u00a0\r\n  **Note:** The concentration of Cell-Tak stock solution may vary in each lot.\u3000We mixed 16.55 \u00b5l of Cell-Tak stock solution \\(2.03 mg/ml in 5% acetic acid) with 1.475 ml of sodium bicarbonate \\(0.1 M, pH 8.0) and immediately added 8.275 \u00b5l sodium hydroxide \\(1 M) to adjust the pH to approximately 8.0.\r\n\n\n2. Apply 50 \u00b5l of the Cell-Tak solution to each well of the XF\ne\n24 cell culture microplates and incubate them at RT for 20 min. \r\n  3. Aspirate the Cell-Tak solution and rinse each well twice using 200 \u00b5l of sterile water.\r\n  **Tip:** The Cell-Tak-coated-XF\ne\n24 cell culture microplates may be stored for up 1 week at 4\u02daC.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**C. Embryonic cell preparation**\r\n\n\n1. Put male and female flies in a fly embryo-collecting container set on a grape juice agar dish with a yeast chunk in the center \\(**Figure 1a and 2a, b**) in the afternoon \\(e.g., 2 pm).\r\n  **Tip:** Use young flies at the age of 3-7 days post eclosion to obtain enough eggs, and the peak of egg-laying will come approximately 5-7 days after mating. Mating can be done either in a fly bottle or in the embryo-collecting container. \r\n\n\n2. Replace the grape juice agar dish with a new one without the yeast chunk by turning the container upside down and mildly anesthetizing the flies with CO\n2\n. Culture the flies in a cooled incubator set at 25\u02daC for 1 hr to collect the embryos.\r\n  3. Remove the grape juice agar dish with the eggs from the container, and further incubate the eggs on the dish at 25\u02daC for 2 hrs.\r\n  4. Prepare Schneider's _Drosophila_ medium containing 5% FBS and 40% bleach in water just before use, and keep both at 4\u02daC. Chill an autoclaved Dounce tissue homogenizer with a loose pestle on ice.\r\n  5. Take the eggs \\(embryos) on the dish out of the incubator and rinse the dish with the embryo washing buffer. Collect the embryos from the dish with a cotton swab \\(**Figure 1b and 2c**) and the embryo washing buffer. Transfer the embryo suspension into a sterilized 1.5-ml tube using a 1-ml plastic pipette. \r\n  **Tip:** Cut off the tip of a 1-ml plastic pipette with scissors for embryo transfer without damage.\r\n\n\n6. Wash the embryos in the 1.5-ml tube several times with the embryo washing buffer and another couple of times with sterilized water \\(**Figure 1c**). \r\n  **Tip:** Centrifugation is not required. The embryos settle quickly.\r\n\n\n7. Dechorionate the embryos with 1 ml of 40% bleach for 2 min \\(**Figure 1c and 2d**).\r\n  **Tip:** Longer incubations reduce cell viability.\r\n\n\n8. Remove the bleach immediately.\r\n  9. Rinse the embryos with 1 ml of 5% FBS/Schneider's _Drosophila_ medium 4 times.\r\n  **Tip:** Centrifugation is not required. The embryos settle quickly.\r\n\n\n10. Resuspend the embryos in 1 ml of 5% FBS/Schneider's _Drosophila_ medium, and transfer into an autoclaved Dounce tissue homogenizer \\(**Figure 1d and 2e**).\r\n  11. Move the Dounce pestle slowly up and down 10-12 times \\(**Figure 1d and 2e**).\r\n  12. Filter the homogenized embryos into a sterilized 50-ml tube through a 40-\u00b5m cell strainer \\(**Figure 1e and 2f**).\r\n  13. Transfer the filtered homogenized solution into a sterilized 1.5 ml tube, and spin down embryonic cells at 1,000 g for 3 min at 4\u02daC.\r\n  14. Remove the supernatant carefully, resuspend the cell pellet using 1.0 ml of 5% FBS/Schneider's _Drosophila_ medium, and spin down at 1,000 g for 3 min at 4\u02daC.\r\n  15. Repeat step 13 two or three more times to remove debris. Suspend the cells with 210 \u00b5l of serum-free Schneider's _Drosophila_ medium and count the cell number using 10 \u00b5l of the cell suspension \\(**Figure 1f and 2g-i**). \r\n  16. Resuspend the cells in an appropriate volume of serum-free Schneider's _Drosophila_ medium kept at RT to achieve the desired cell density per well \\(Best results were obtained in 0.8-1.6 x10\n5\ncells per well \\(See **Figure 4**). Resuspend cells at a concentration of 0.8 x 10\n6\nto 1.6 x 10\n6\ncells/ml).\r\n  **Note:** We prepared approximately 600 \u00b5l of cell suspension from 1,200 eggs for 6-well plating.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**D. Loading of compounds and calibration of the cartridge sensor** \r\n\n\n1. Take the sensor cartridge out of the 25\u02daC incubator. \r\n  2. Apply the appropriate volume of the compounds to the sensor cartridge ports \\(see **Table 1**). \r\n  3. Remove the lid and hydro-booster, assemble the sensor cartridge and the utility plate again, and load it into the Seahorse Analyzer\u2019s tray. Then, start the calibration of the sensor cartridge. \r\n  **Tip:** The calibration process takes approximately 20 min. Proceed to the next steps.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**E. OCR and ECAR analysis**\r\n\n\n1. Add 100 \u00b5l of serum-free Schneider's _Drosophila_ medium to all wells of the Cell-Tak-coated microplate kept at RT. \r\n  **Tip:** Cell-Tak-coated XF\ne\n24 Cell culture microplate must be kept at RT before cell seeding. Do not pre-incubate the serum-containing medium in Cell-Tak-coated wells, as this results in the loss of adhesion.\r\n\n\n2. Dispense 100 \u00b5l of the cell suspension from step 16 in **C** to each sample well.\r\n  **Note:** We used 6 wells per line.\r\n\n\nTip: Monolayer cell adhesion on the microplate is important to measure the OCR and ECAR.\r\n\n\n3. Add 100 \u00b5l of serum-free Schneider's _Drosophila_ medium to the background/control wells.\r\n  4. Centrifuge the microplate at 200 g for 1 min. Do not use a braking system. \r\n  5. Transfer the microplate to the 25\u02daC incubator for 25-30 minutes to ensure the cells have completely attached.\r\n  6. Confirm that most of the cells have adhered to the bottom of wells using an inverted microscope \\(**Figure 2j**).\r\n  7. Slowly and gently add 400 \u00b5l of serum-free Schneider's _Drosophila_ medium along the side of each well to avoid disturbing the cells.\r\n  8. Further incubate the microplate in the 25\u02daC incubator for 15 min.\r\n  9. Replace the utility plate from step 3 in **D** with the embryonic cell-seeded microplate and start the assay. Proceed to the MitoStress assay according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol \\(**Table 2**).\r\n  10. After the assay, collect the cells using a 1-ml pipette, and lyse the cell pellet using a 5-10x volume of RIPA buffer. Measure the total protein concentration using a BCA assay kit."

Studies using _Drosophila_ have contributed to the understanding of the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases. Here, we provide measurement protocols for the oxygen consumption rate \\(OCR) and extracellular acidification rate \\(ECAR) that have been optimized for _Drosophila_ cells from early developmental stage embryos using the Seahorse XF<sup>e</sup>24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. These methods require fertilized eggs with a synchronized developmental stage that have been mechanically homogenized and subsequently plated on a microplate for the assay. With these protocols, the OCR and the ECAR can be measured in _Drosophila_ embryonic cells during a variety of mitochondrial stresses in real time and the electron flux can be estimated during oxidative phosphorylation \\(OXPHOS).",
