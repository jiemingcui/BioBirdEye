            "content": "<p>Actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs) represent a large family of small monomeric proteins and their enzymatic activity includes actin binding and subsequent depolymerization or severing of F-actin or actin bundles. Different isoforms of ADF may show different levels of enzymatic activity and such difference may dictate their diverse physiological roles. It is therefore useful to envision a relatively quick and streamlined protocol to screen the functionality of large ADF protein families in plants or alternatively a broader biochemical characterization of ADF homologues across the kingdom. In this protocol, we describe the basic principles, materials and detailed procedures for assessment of the actin binding and depolymerizing activity of the recombinant ADF proteins in vitro. We also describe a quick protocol for single actin filament visualization and live documentation of ADF functionality with respect to filament organization and depolymerization. These assays together constitute a basic yet comprehensive protocol for characterization of ADF proteins.</p>"

            "content": "A generalized scheme for characterization of plant ADFs is depicted in Figure 1.\nConstruction of recombinant plant expression vectors\n1. CLone ADF cDNAs in pET200 prokaryotic expression vector carrying a N-terminal His-tag. Alternatively, the CDNAs can be cloned in any bacterial expression vector carrying a C-terminal or N-terminal affinity tag suitable for purification using standard cloning procedure.\n2. Transform the ADF expression constructs into\nE.coli\nBL21 (DE3) cells under Ampicillin selection and confirm positive clones by PCR amplification.\nExpression and purification of recombinant ADF2 proteins\n1. Express the 6XHis-fusion proteins in BL21 (DE3) cells. Briefly, inoculate 100 mL LB with 2% transformed bacterial cells (1 mL) and grow overnight at 37 \u00baC in an orbital shaker at 225 rpm until the O.D.\n600\nreaches 0.4-0.6.\n2. Add IPTG (100 mL from 1M stock) at a final concentration of 1mM and grow for an additional 4 hours under same conditions to induce the recombinant protein expression.\n3. Harvest the cells by centrifugation (5000 rpm) at 4 \u00b0C for 15 minutes and wash in sonication buffer. Sonicate the cells in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 supplemented with PMSF and \u03b2-ME at the pulse of 30 seconds each of 35% amplitude until the lysate is clear. To avoid foaming and protein degradation, sonication over ice in glass vials is recommended for small proteins. Addition of protease inhibitor cocktail can also increase protein recovery.\n4. Separate the soluble fraction from membrane fraction by centrifugation (12,000 rpm) at 4 \u00b0C for 15 minutes. Collect\u00a0the supernatant and pellet separately.\n4. Confirm the expression of protein with the mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody in a 1:2000 dilution and a HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody in a 1:10000 dilution by standard western blotting procedures (we used an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Pierce, USA) following manufacturer\u2019s instruction).\n6. Majority of the proteins are expressed in the membrane fraction (as observed from the western blots in our experiments). It may not be the case for all ADFs, but if more protein is observed in the membrane fraction, native purification protocol should be followed as per manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The buffer compositions for both native and denaturing conditions are described in the reagent section.\n7. Solubilize the membrane fraction in 8 M Urea, 100 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\nand 100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and purify with Ni-NTA resin columns (QIAGEN, USA). Improved protein elution is obtained in acidic condition and addition of 200-250 mM imidazole. About 70-80% protein homogeneity can be obtained.\n8. Purified protein fractions were pulled and step-dialyzed against a final buffer composition of 10mM Tris-Cl, 50mM NaCl, 1mM DTT and 10% glycerol.\n9. Check the concentration of protein using Bradford Assay. Briefly, 10\u00b5L of each standard or unknown sample is added to 390\u00b5L of the Coomassie Plus Reagent (Pierce, USA), mixed and incubated for 10 minutes at RT. Measure the absorbance at or near 595 nm with water as blank. Prepare a standard curve by plotting the average blank-corrected 595 nm measurement for each BSA standard vs its concentration in \u00b5g/mL. This standard curve is used to determine the protein concentration of each unknown sample.\nActin preparation\nHuman platelet G-actin (85% beta and 15% gamma iso-forms) can be obtained from Cytoskeleton Inc, USA. Non-muscle actin has an approximate molecular weight of 43 kDa. The protein is provided as a lyophilized white powder, which is stable for 6 months when stored desiccated to <10% humidity at 4 \u00b0C. It will then be in the following buffer:\nActin polymerization\n1. Add 25\u00b5L sterile distilled water to a 250 \u00b5g supplied lyophilized aliquot to make a 10 mg/mL solution. Store the actin in 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.2 mM ATP, 5% sucrose, and 1% dextran. Dilute working aliquots of 5 \u00b5L with general actin buffer (GAB; 5mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0 and 0.2mM CaCl\n2\n) buffer to a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL. Mix 1\u00b5L of working aliquot with 2x Laemmli sample buffer and run in 12% SDS\u2013PAGE to check for 43 KDa single band.\n2. Snap-freeze the small aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at -70 \u00baC. Avoid frequent freezing and thawing; thaw the aliquots for experiments as required.\n3. Polymerize the G-actin in a buffer containing 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl\n2\nand 1 mM ATP at 25 \u00baC for an extended time of 3 h.\n4. Separate the F-actin/actin bundles from G-actin by centrifugation (~40,000 g) at 4 \u00baC for 3 h.\n5. Discard ~90% of the supernatant and reconstitute the pellet in equal volumes of actin binding buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM ATP, 0.2 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1mM CaCl\n2\nand 2mM MgCl\n2\n) and immediately use for binding assays.\nHigh and low speed co-sedimentation with actin\n1.Incubate the ADF proteins with bundled/polymerized actin in binding buffer at RT for 2-3 h, and then centrifuge at ~40,000 g at 4 \u00baC for 1 h (low-speed) or 100,000g for 20 min (high-speed).\n2. Remover the supernatant carefully so as to not disturb the pellet. Dissolve the pellet in actin binding buffer and precipitate with acetone.\n3. Suspend the pellet in Laemmli sample buffer and run in a 12% SDS-PAGE.\n4. Measure the protein quantity in-gel by assessing band density using imageJ and imagesoft lite software (NIH, LICOR).\nF-actin depolymerization assays using pyrene-labeled fluorescent actin\n1. Polymerize rabbit muscle pyrene-labeled actin (4\u00a0\u03bcM, 30% pyrene-labeled; Cytoskeleton Inc, USA) for 1.5\u00a0h\u00a0at 20 \u00b0C in 50\u00a0mM KCl, 2\u00a0mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.4\u00a0mM DTT and 0.5\u00a0mM ATP.\n2. Buffer the reaction medium with 1:1 volume of 10\u00a0mM Tris, pH\u00a08.0.\n3. Induce depolymerization either by diluting samples to a final actin concentration of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM or adding 0.8 \u03bcM of ADF protein.\n4. Record pyrene fluorescence after dilution over an hour using a fluorimeter with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 420 nm. Decrease in fluorescence is directly proportional to the rate of depolymerization.\n5. The depolymerizing activity can be measured in two different ways; by adding proteins to either pre-polymerized actin or to an actively polymerizing G-actin solution. Quantify the decrease in polymerization relative to polymerizing actin without ADF proteins.\nSingle filament microscopy to visualize actin filament severing and depolymerization\nAactin filament disassembly and severing by ADF proteins can be directly observed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF). We used 24 \u00d7 60 mm coverslips (Fisher Scientific, USA) and poly-L-lysine coated slides (VWR, USA).\u00a0Clear double-sided tape was used to create a gap between coverslip and slide surfaces.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare 1 mg/mL rabbit muscle skeletal actin (Cytoskeleton Inc, USA) as described before and allow to polymerize in the presence of 1/10\nth\nvolume 10X polymerization buffer (500mM KCl, 20mM MgCl2, 10mM ATP and 0.1mM EGTA) for 1 h at RT.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Label the unseeded filaments directly labeled on the coverslip in a flow of 1X polymerization buffer containing 70 nM acti-stain 488 Phalloidin.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mix 2.5 \u03bcL actin filaments with 8 \u03bcM of ADF proteins suspended in assay buffer described earlier.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Image the filaments immediately on a Leica DM6000/TIRF system equipped with a 63x objective and CCD live imaging camera. We performed imaging at five-second frame intervals spanning 160 seconds.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analyze the TIRF data using ImageJ software (NIH, USA).

For a very active ADF protein, actin binding should start at low concentrations of input proteins as we found in some of the isoforms we used. The gel-based quantitation of actin sedimentation is, however, not always accurate and it is important to support the results with fluorescence-tagged actin. Once the basic information of the activity pattern of all ADF members is obtained, it is suggested to test them across larger pH range and in presence or absence of inhibitors and co-factors. Depolymerization assay should always accompany co-sedimentation. Lastly, for an active ADF protein, polymerized actin filaments (F-actin; 2-8 \u03bcm length) should start depolymerizing immediately after addition of protein; both severing and depolymerization from pointed end can be observed very definitively under live imaging. Several parameters can be calculated from these results. </p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs) are small monomeric<strong> </strong>actin-binding proteins<strong> </strong>that alter the oligomeric state of cellular actin. Members of the ADF family can bind both the G-actin and F-actin in plants, and their functions are regulated by cellular pH, ionic strength and availability of other binding partners. Actin depolymerization activity is reportedly essential for plant viability. By binding to the ADP-bound form of actin, ADFs severe actin filaments and thereby provide more barbed filament ends for polymerization. They also increase the rate of dissociation of F-actin monomer by changing the helical twist of the actin filament. These two activities together make ADF the major regulator of actin dynamics in plant cell. Therefore, it is essential to measure the binding and depolymerization activity of the plant ADFs. Here, we present a simplified, streamlined step-by-step protocol to quickly measure these important functions of the ADF proteins in vitro.</p><p><br></p>",
