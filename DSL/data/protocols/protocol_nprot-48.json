Achieve this by subjecting isolated pbNK cells to the same isolation protocol used for the isolation of dNK cells\\(2).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Staining and cell sorting**\r\n\n\n1)  Wash cells in PBS supplemented with 2% FCS and incubate with mAb on ice for 30 min.\r\n\n\n2)  Wash twice. \r\n\n\n3)  Cell sort and measure fluorescence on a MoFlo high performance cell sorter \\(DakoCytomation). \r\n\n\n4)  Collect data from single cell events using a standard FACScaliburTM flow cytometer \\(Immunocytometry systems; Beckton Dickinson). \r\n\n\n5)  Highly purify peripheral blood NK subsets to obtain 2 subsets: CD56dimCD16+CD3- NK \\(pbCD16+ NK) and CD56brightCD16-CD3- \\(pbCD16- NK). Decidual NK cells should be uniformly of the CD56brightCD16-CD3-phenotype \\(dNK) cells.  Subset purity should be routinely higher than 99%.  \r\n\n\n6)  Perform intracellular staining with a Cytoperm-Cytofix Intracellular Staining kit \\(Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions."
