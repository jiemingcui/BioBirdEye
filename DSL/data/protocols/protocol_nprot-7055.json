            "content": "There are currently many methods now available for generating haplotype information \\(Zhang et al. 2006; Ma et al. 2010; Fan et al. 2011; Kitzman et al. 2011; Suk et al. 2011; Duitama et al. 2012; Peters et al. 2012; Selvaraj et al. 2013; Amini et al. 2014; Kuleshov et al. 2014; Zheng et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2017).  The majority are based on co-barcoding short sequencing templates originating from long genomic DNA molecules \\(Peters et al. 2014), a process first described by Drmanac \\(Drmanac 2006).  We first enabled co-barcoding with the development of long fragment read \\(LFR).  While the method \\(McElwain et al. 2017) was quite useful and resulted in the complete phasing of hundreds of genomes \\(Peters et al. 2012; Schaaf et al. 2013; Peters et al. 2015; Ciotlos et al. 2016; Hellner et al. 2016; Mao et al. 2016; Gulbahce et al. ; Walker et al. 2017; Mao et al. 2018), including over 100 from the personal genome project \\(Mao et al. 2016), and the accurate sequencing from difficult samples where as few as five cells were available \\(Peters et al. 2012; Peters et al. 2015; Hellner et al. 2016; Gulbahce et al. 2017; Mao et al. 2018), it had several limitations.  Primarily, each sample was split across a 384 well plate, so processing multiple samples at a time meant handling multiple plates.  In addition, because the process relied on multiple displacement amplification, it had base calling bias in regions of high GC base content and sequencing coverage was more variable necessitating <sub>100X coverage to achieve high quality whole genome variant calling.  Finally, because only 384 compartments were used, this resulted in </sub>10% of a haploid genome per barcode and limited the phasing N50 length, made it more difficult to detect structural variations, and made de novo assembly impossible.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHere we introduce a method called single tube long fragment read \\(stLFR).  This process was first proposed by us in a patent application \\(Drmanac 2013) and a similar, but limited implementation of this method was published by Zhang et al. \\(Zhang et al. 2017).  Like the LFR process described above stLFR utilizes the concept of co-barcoding short reads belonging to a long DNA fragment.  Unlike LFR, the stLFR process uses the surface of micron sized magnetic beads as compartments and as the name suggests this process take place in a single tube.  In a typical stLFR experiment 10-50 million beads are used.  Each bead contains hundreds of thousands of copies of the same barcode and there are a total of 3.6 billion different barcodes.  This means in an stLFR sample there is practically no overlap between barcode sequences.  Also, because only 1-10 ngs of genomic DNA is used, most beads capture less than 10 long DNA molecules.  For de novo assembly applications it is possible to achieve over 80% of long DNA fragments having sequencing reads co-barcoded by a unique barcode \\(captured by a single bead) by using 1 ng of DNA and 50 million beads.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nstLFR is a simple process that can be performed without any special equipment.  The process begins by inserting a transposon with a capture sequence at a regular interval along the genomic DNA molecules.  These transposons inserted DNA molecules are then added to barcode labeled 3 \u03bcM magnetic beads that contain a complementary sequence to the capture sequence on the transposon.  After hybridization, the barcode is transferred to the transposon sequence through a ligation step.  At this point two different methods can be used.  The first and the simplest is to directly PCR amplify using primers to the transposon sequences followed by analysis on a next generation sequencing \\(NGS) platform.  If more coverage of each original long genomic DNA molecule is desired an additional ligation step with another adapter sequence can be performed followed by PCR and sequencing.  Both methods are described in detail in the following protocol.  A full analysis of stLFR data was performed by Wang et al. \\(Wang et al. 2018)."

There are a total of 1,536 unique barcode oligos for each barcode set and there are 3 barcode sets.  This enables up to ~3.6 billion different barcode combinations.  This may be more than necessary for some applications and less barcode combinations can be achieved by ordering less plates of oligonucleotides.  This particular design does require that at least one barcode oligo from each set is used to create the proper final sequence, however, slight modifications of the 6 base overlapping sequences between barcode sets can be made to remove an entire barcode set."

Full length adaptors are constructed through successive ligations \\(Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1).  Barcode oligonucleotides are supplied in 384-well plates \\(see Reagents Notes).  Common adapter oligo nucleotides are supplied in tubes.

Dispense 11.2 \u03bcL of the ligation mixture into each well of four new 384-well PCR plates.  Then add 8.8 \u03bcL \\(580 pmol) from each well of the hybridized first barcode plates to each well containing the bead linker ligation mixture.  Seal with MicroAmp Clear Adhesive Film, vortex, centrifuge, and incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.\r\n  \r\n\n\n16.  Collect 100 billion \\(143 mL) of M-280 streptavidin coated magnetic beads by transferring 50 mL beads into empty 50 mL centrifuge tube.  Place the 50 mL tube with beads in the Easy 50 EasySep\u2122 Magnet for 5 minutes to collect beads to the side of the tube.  Carefully remove supernatant by pipette.  Transfer a second 50 mL beads into tube on magnet.  Let sit for 5 minutes on magnet and carefully remove supernatant.  Transfer a final 43 mL of beads to the 50 mL tube.  Let sit for 5 minutes on magnet and carefully remove supernatant.  Wash beads twice with Low-Salt Wash Buffer then resuspend well in 8 mL of High-Salt Bead Binding Buffer.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n17.  Dispense 5 \u03bcL of beads in High-Salt Bead Binding Buffer to each well of the plates containing ligation product.  Vortex the beads source tube occasionally during dispensing to keep the beads well-suspended. \r\n  \r\n\n\n18.  Seal plates with MicroAmp Clear Adhesive Film, vortex, and place onto the tube revolver for incubation at room temperature for 1 hour on \u201coscillating\u201d mode.\r\n  \r\n\n\n19.  Centrifuge plates at 300 x g for 5 seconds to remove beads from seal, but not allow a pellet to form.  Remove seal and add 2.8 \u03bcL 0.1% SDS to each well.  Seal plates again with MicroAmp Clear Adhesive Film, vortex briefly and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n20.  Vortex and then centrifuge plates at 300 x g for 5 seconds to remove beads from the plate seal.  Remove the seal from each plate and invert plates onto a collection tray.  Centrifuge at 500 x g for 2 minutes.  Using a 10 mL serological pipette, collect beads into one new 50 mL tube.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n21.  Collect beads to the side of the tube on the Easy 50 EasySep\u2122 Magnet for 5 minutes.  Discard supernatant. Wash once with 10 mL of High Salt Wash Buffer and then twice with Low-Salt Wash Buffer.  Resuspend beads 8 mL 1XLigation Buffer.\r\n  \r\n\n\n22.  Dispense 5ul of beads into each well of four new 384-well PCR plates. Vortex the beads source tube occasionally during dispensing to keep the beads well-suspended.\r\n  \r\n\n\n23.  To ligate the second set of barcodes, make a mixture containing 3.225 mL Ligation Buffer \\(10X), 460.8 \u03bcL \\(921,600 units) of T4 DNA Ligase, and 6.33 mL dH2O to a total volume of 10.02 mL.  Dispense 6.2 \u03bcL of the second ligation mixture to each well of the four 384-well PCR plates containing beads.  Next add 8.8 \u03bcL \\(580pmol) from each well of the hybridized second barcode plates to the corresponding wells of the 384-well PCR plates containing the bead and ligation mixture.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n24.  Repeat steps 18-22.\r\n  \r\n\n\n25.  To ligate the third set of barcodes, make a ligation mixture containing 3.225 mL Ligation Buffer \\(10X), 460.8 \u03bcL \\(921,600 units) of T4 DNA Ligase, and 6.33 mL dH2O to a total volume of 10.02 mL.  Dispense 6.2 \u03bcL of the third ligation mixture to each well of the four 384-well PCR plates containing beads.  Next add 8.8 \u03bcL \\(580pmol) from each well of the hybridized third barcode plates to the corresponding wells of the 384-well PCR plates containing the bead and ligation mixture.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n26. Repeat steps 18-22.  The beads can now be stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to one year.  In the current form the beads are almost completely double stranded and not yet in the correct form to be used for stLFR.\r\n  \r\n\n\n27. Count the beads with hemocytometer and take out 5 million beads for the QC step. Place the tube with beads onto the DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 5 minutes.  Discard supernatant.  Add 5 \u03bcL 100% formamide, 4 \u03bcL dH2O and 1 \u03bcL 10X loading buffer.  Incubate it at 95 \u00b0C for 3 minutes on a PCR thermocycler.  Immediately place on ice for 2 minutes.  Place the tube with beads onto the DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 5 minutes. Collect supernatant, load on a 15% TBU gel, and run at 200 V for 40 minutes to check the oligo length and amount \\(Figure 2).   Alternatively, beads can be examined using a flow cytometer by hybridizing a fluorescently labeled oligo to the 3\u2019 end of the bead adapter sequence.  We typically see about 25% of the total streptavidin bound sites have a full length constructed adapter sequence.\r\n  \r\n\n\nBead preparation for stLFR\r\n\n\nTo prepare beads for stLFR, they must first be denatured to single stranded DNA and then rehybridized with the bridge oligo.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n28.  Pipette 500 million constructed barcoded beads from step 26. of the previous section into a standard 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n29.  Place on DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 2 minutes to collect beads onto the side of the tube.  Remove supernatant.\r\n  \r\n\n\n30.  Add 1 mL of a 1X dilution of Buffer D. Vortex briefly and incubate for 2 minutes at room temperature.\r\n  \r\n\n\n31.  Place on DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 2 minutes to collect beads onto the side of the tube.  Remove supernatant.\r\n  \r\n\n\n32.  Repeat steps 30 and 31 one more time.\r\n  \r\n\n\n33.  Wash once in 1X Annealing buffer.  Place on DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 2 minutes to collect beads onto the side of the tube.  Remove supernatant.\r\n  \r\n\n\n34.  Mix 36 \u03bcL of 100 \u03bcM Bridge Oligo, 333.33 \u03bcL of Annealing Buffer \\(3X), and 630.67 \u03bcL of dH2O for a final volume of 1 mL.  Add to mixture to beads. Vortex briefly.\r\n  \r\n\n\n35.  Incubate at 60 \u00b0C for 5 minutes, and room temperature for 50 minutes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n36.  Place on DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 2 minutes to collect beads onto the side of the tube.  Remove supernatant and resuspend in 500 \u03bcL of Low-Salt Wash Buffer.  These beads are now ready for stLFR and can be stored for 3 months at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\nTwo transposons stLFR protocol\r\n\n\nThe protocol utilizes two transposons to create hybridization sequences and PCR primer sites along the length of genomic DNA molecules.  This is the most simplified and quickest stLFR method, but has potentially 50% less coverage per long DNA fragment than the 3\u2019 branch ligation protocol.  It may be necessary to alter some of the transposon sequence after the mosaic region for compatibility with sequencing technologies other than BGISEQ-500.  Check the sequencing primers being used prior to ordering these oligonucleotides.  Information on all of the oligonucleotide sequences is available in the supplementary materials.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n37.  Hybridize the capture transposon oligos by combining 10 \u03bcL of Transposon1T \\(100 \u03bcM), 10 \u03bcL of TransposonB \\(100 \u03bcM), 10 \u03bcL of Annealing Buffer \\(3X) in the first well of an 8 well PCR strip tube and the non-captured transposon oligos by combining 10 \u03bcL of Transposon1T \\(100 \u03bcM), 10 \u03bcL of TransposonB \\(100 \u03bcM), 10 \u03bcL of Annealing Buffer \\(3X) in the second well of the same PCR strip tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n38.  Incubate at 70 \u00b0C for 3 minutes followed by a slow ramp of 0.1 \u00b0C/s to 20 \u00b0C on a PCR thermocycler.  Combine the two transposons into the third well of the PCR strip tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n39.  Couple the Tn5 enzyme to the transposon mix by combining 9.6 \u03bcL of mix transposons with 23.53 \u03bcL of Tn5 \\(13.6 pmol/\u03bcL), and 46.87 \u03bcL of Coupling Buffer \\(1X).\r\n  \r\n\n\n40.  Incubate at 30 \u00b0C for 1 hour. Use immediately or store at -20 \u00b0C for up to 1 month.  For optimal performance and consistency between experiments we suggest making aliquots prior to storage.\r\n  \r\n\n\n41.  Incorporate transposons into long genomic DNA by combining 12 \u03bcL of Transposase Buffer \\(5X), 0.5 \u03bcL of coupled transposon from step 40, and 40 ng of DNA in a total volume of 60 \u03bcL in one well of an 8-well strip tube.  Note: this amount of DNA and the amount of coupled transposon can be adjusted in this step.  It will be necessary to titrate the amount of Tn5 enzyme used as there can be variability between batches.  Also, starting with less DNA is possible, but for the purposes of titration it is useful to use 40 ng so that some of the material can be run on an agarose gel to determine the efficiency of transposon incorporation \\(see later steps).\r\n  \r\n\n\n42.  Incubate at 55 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n43.  Transfer 40 \u03bcL of transposon incorporated material to one well of a new 8-well strip tube.  Add 4 \u03bcL of 1% SDS and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n44.  Load the material from step 43 on a 0.5X TBE 1% agarose gel and run at 150 V for 40 minutes.  The transposed DNA should run between 200 to 1,500 bp on the gel \\(Figure 3).  We typically want to see the brightest part of the DNA smear around 600 bp, this might be different based on which sequencing technology is chosen.  We typically load controls that are put through the same steps but lack the transposon, the Tn5 enzyme, or genomic DNA.  If the size of transposon integrated products looks correct proceed to step 45.  If not, repeat the steps above but adjust the concentration of the coupling product until the smear is the desired size.\r\n  \r\n\n\n45.  Dilute 1.5 \u03bcL of the remaining product of step 42, with 248.5 \u03bcL of 1x Hybridization buffer.\r\n  \r\n\n\n46.  Transfer 50 \u03bcL of beads \\(50 million) from step 36 to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.  Place on DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 2 minutes to collect beads onto the side of the tube.  Remove supernatant and resuspend in 250 \u03bcL of Hybridization Buffer \\(1X).\r\n  \r\n\n\n47.  Heat DNA and beads separately at 60 \u00b0C for 30 seconds.\r\n  \r\n\n\n48.  Add 250 \u03bcL of diluted DNA to the 250 \u03bcL of beads, mix gently by flicking the bottom of the tube with a finger, and continue incubating at 60 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.  Lightly mix the tube every few minutes with your finger.\r\n  \r\n\n\n49.  Place on tube revolver for incubation in oven at 45 \u00b0C for 50 minutes on \u201coscillating\u201d mode.\r\n  \r\n\n\n50.  Make ligation mix by combining 100 \u03bcL of Ligation Buffer, No MgCl2 \\(10X), 2 \u03bcL of T4 DNA ligase \\(2x106 units/mL), and 398 \u03bcL of dH2O.  Remove tube from rotator and add ligation mix for a total volume of 1 mL.\r\n  \r\n\n\n51.  Incubate on tube revolver for 1 hour on \u201coscillating\u201d mode at room temperature.\r\n  \r\n\n\n52.  Add 110 \u03bcL of 1% SDS to tube and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.\r\n  \r\n\n\n53.  Place on DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 2 minutes to collect beads onto the side of the tube.  Remove supernatant and wash once with 500 \u03bcL of Low-Salt Wash Buffer and once with 500 \u03bcL of NEB2 buffer \\(1X).\r\n  \r\n\n\n54.  Make capture oligo digestion mix by combining 10 \u03bcL of NEB2 buffer \\(10X), 2 \u03bcL of UDG \\(5,000 U/mL), 3 \u03bcL of APE1 \\(10,000 U/mL), 2 \u03bcL of Exonuclease 1 \\(20,000 units/mL), and 83 \u03bcL of dH2O.  Remove wash buffer and add digestion mix to beads.\r\n  \r\n\n\n55.  Vortex lightly to resuspend beads and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n56.  Place on DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 2 minutes to collect beads onto the side of the tube.  Remove supernatant and wash once with 500 \u03bcL of Low-Salt Wash Buffer and once with 500 \u03bcL of PfuCx Buffer \\(1X).\r\n  \r\n\n\n57.  Prepare PCR master mix by adding 150 \u03bcL of PCR mix \\(2X), 4 \u03bcL of PCR Primer 1 \\(100 \u03bcM), 4 \u03bcL of PCR primer 2 \\(100 \u03bcM), 6 \u03bcL of PfuCx enzyme, and 136 \u03bcL of dH2O.  Preheat the PCR mastermix at 95 \u00b0C for 3 minutes. Place on DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 2 minutes to collect beads onto the side of the tube. Remove wash buffer and add PCR master mix to beads.\r\n  \r\n\n\n58.  Vortex lightly to resuspend beads and cycle PCR reaction with the following conditions: \r\n  \r\n\n\nStep 1  72 \u00b0C  10 minutes\r\n\n\nStep 2  95 \u00b0C  10 seconds\r\n\n\nStep 3  58 \u00b0C  30 seconds\r\n\n\nStep 4  72 \u00b0C  2 minutes\r\n\n\nStep 6  Repeat steps 2-5 10-12 times\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n59.  PCR should result in ~500 ng of DNA, run 20 ng of product on a 0.5X TBE 1% agarose gel for 40 minutes at 150 V.  The material should be a smear with a peak around 500 bp \\(Figure 4).\r\n  \r\n\n\n60.  Purify PCR product with 300 \u03bcL of Agencourt XP beads following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.  This purified product is now ready to enter the sequencing process.\r\n  \r\n\n\nSingle transposon 3\u2019 branch ligation stLFR protocol\r\n\n\nThis protocol is based on the single transposon insertion and novel adapter ligation methods in a DNA gap \\(ref) and can enable higher coverage per fragment, which may be important for some sequencing strategies such as de novo assembly.  This strategy is slightly more expensive due to additional reagents.  It also takes 2.5 hours longer.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n61.  Hybridize the capture transposon oligos by combining 10 \u03bcL of Transposon1T \\(100 \u03bcM), 10 \u03bcL of TransposonB \\(100 \u03bcM), 10 \u03bcL of Annealing Buffer \\(3X) in the first well of an 8 well PCR strip tube and the 3\u2019 branch ligation adapter by combing 10 \u03bcL of BranchT \\(100 \u03bcM), 10 \u03bcL of BranchB \\(100 \u03bcM), 10 \u03bcL of Annealing Buffer \\(3X) in the second well of the same PCR strip tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n62.  Incubate at 70 \u00b0C for 3 minutes followed by a slow ramp of 0.1 \u00b0C/s to 20 \u00b0C on a PCR thermocycler.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n63.  Couple the Tn5 enzyme to the transposon by combining 9.6 \u03bcL of hybridized capture transposon in step 61 with 23.53 \u03bcL of Tn5 \\(13.6 pmol/\u03bcL), and 46.87 \u03bcL of Coupling Buffer \\(1X).\r\n  \r\n\n\n64.  Incubate at 30 \u00b0C for 1 hour.  Use immediately or store at -20 \u00b0C for up to 1 month.\r\n  \r\n\n\n65.  Follow steps 41-51.\r\n  \r\n\n\n66.

Remove supernatant and wash once with 500 \u03bcL of Low-Salt Wash Buffer and once with 500 \u03bcL of NEB2 buffer \\(1X).  \r\n  \r\n\n\n71.  Make capture oligo digestion mix by combining 10 \u03bcL of NEB2 buffer \\(10X), 2 \u03bcL of UDG \\(5,000 U/mL), 3 \u03bcL of APE1 \\(10,000 U/mL), and 85 \u03bcL of dH2O.  Remove wash buffer and add digestion mix to beads.\r\n  \r\n\n\n72.  Lightly vortex to resuspend beads and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n73.  Place on DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet for 2 minutes to collect beads onto the side of the tube.  Remove supernatant and wash once with 500 \u03bcL of High-Salt Wash Buffer and once with 500 \u03bcL of Low-Salt Wash Buffer \\(1X).\r\n  \r\n\n\n74. Prepare SSB binding mix by combining 20 \u03bcL of SSB binding buffer \\(1X) and 4 \u03bcL of ET SSB \\(500 \u03bcg/mL). Remove wash buffer and add SSB binding mix to beads.\r\n  \r\n\n\n75.

Follow steps 59-60 above.\r\n  \r\n\n\nAnalyzing stLFR data\r\n\n\nThe starting point for this process is a FASTQ file.  This is a standard format for read data that is generated by most sequencing technologies.  The software we use to deconvolute the barcode information takes the FASTQ file and expects 42 bases of the barcode and common adapter sequence to be appended to the end of the first read.  It matches the barcode read data to the expected 1536 sequences at each barcode position.  The barcoding strategy used by stLFR enables error correction of barcodes that have a single base mismatch.  The final output from our software is a FASTQ file with the barcode information appended to the end of the read ID with the format #Barcode1ID_Barcode2ID_Barcode3ID, where BarcodeID is a number from 0-1536.  Zero for a barcode ID means it did not match any of the expected barcode sequences.  The software can be downloaded here https://github.com/stLFR/stLFR_read_demux.  We recommend using BWA-mem \\(Li and Durbin 2009) for mapping, GATK \\(McKenna et al. 2010) for variant calling, and HapCUT2 \\(Edge et al. 2017) for phasing.  We also recommend mapping to Hg19 with decoy sequences."

However, the diploid information found in most genomes is still lost by the most common sequencing methods.  There are several methods currently available for obtaining this haplotype information.  However, most of these methods are either time consuming, require expensive equipment and reagents, or both.  Here we describe single tube long fragment read \\(stLFR), a simple barcoded bead-based process capable of near perfect whole genome variant calling and haplotyping.  Our method uses equipment available in nearly all molecular biology laboratories and costs approximately 30 dollars a sample.  In addition, the data generated from this process is capable of detecting and phasing structural variations and scaffolding contigs.  We expect in the future that this process will enable affordable diploid de novo assembly.",
