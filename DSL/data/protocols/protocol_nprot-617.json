            "content": "Several methods for protein determination have been developed \\[1] but the ones most commonly used today are based on the reaction of proteins with Commassie Brilliant Blue G-250 \\(CBB) \\[2] and alkaline Cu\\(II) \\[3]. The most recent modifications of these methods are the Sedmak assay \\[4] and the bicinchoninic acid \\(BCA) assay \\[5]. Another sensitive method for measuring proteins is the colloidal gold protein assay \\[6] which has been modified to quantify specific proteins of interest \\[7,8].\r\n\n\nThe present protocol is a very simple CBB-based protein assay which is more sensitive and less prone to interference than the commonly used Bradford, Sedmak and BCA assays \\[9]. It uses the hydrophobic reagents ammonium sulfate \\(AS) and trichloroacetic acid \\(TCA) to increase the binding of more CBB molecules per protein molecule \\(for mechanism see Figure 1). The protocol consists of three independent sub-protocols: general assay, microplate assay and microassay, with minimum detectable protein 100, 50 and 150 ng, respectively, which make it 100/40 and 200/5 fold more sensitive than the Sigma/Pierce Bradford and BCA assays, respectively \\[9]."

The CBB neutral species binds to proteins both by hydrophobic interactions (via Phe, Trp etc), and by electrostatic attraction between the distant to the quaternary N dissociated sulfonic group primarily and the positively charged guanidino group of Arg (and secondarily with Lys, His). Upon protein binding, the absorbance of the neutral species shifts to 615-625 nm possibly due to a weakening of the heteropolar bond of the proton-neutralized sulfonic group proximal to the quaternary N (see dashed arrow), making it to behave spectrally as a pseudo-anionic species). B. The CBB anionic species binds to proteins primarily by electrostatic attraction between the distant to the quaternary N dissociated sulfonic group primarily and Arg (Lys, His), forming a complex absorbing at 650 nm and thus having spectral properties similar to the neutral species. Reaction of the quanidino group of Arg with the dissociated sulfonic group proximal to the positively charged quaternary N seems not to be favored due to electrostatic repulsions. C. The CBB cationic species does not form complex with proteins because its absorbance at 470 nm does not change. This is expected because both sulfonic groups of this species are unavailable (proton-neutralized) for reaction with Arg, Lys, His.",
