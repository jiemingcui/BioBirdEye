            "content": "Insertional mutagenesis approaches use oncoretroviruses or transposons to trigger cancer in mice by widespread integration into the cellular genome and activation of oncogenes near the integration site. Mapping the genomic integration sites in tumors allows the identification of genomic regions that are recurrently hit in independent tumors \\(defined as Common Insertion Sites, CIS)<sup>5</sup>, which host genes likely involved in cancer development<sup>6</sup>. \r\n\n\nWe have recently developed a new specifically tailored LV-based insertional mutagen that allowed the induction of hepatocellular carcinoma in 3 different mouse models<sup>4</sup>. In order to identify the integration sites from LV-induced tumors and control nontumoral samples, we exploited LAM-PCR<sup>1</sup> followed by 454 pyrosequencing. The analysis of LV integrations in tumors allowed the identification of 4 new liver cancer genes. Here we describe how we applied the LAM-PCR protocol1 for the retrieval of LV integrations from the hepatocellular carcinomas induced in our cancer gene discovery screening.\r\n\n\nApplication of this protocol to oligoclonal tumors induced by insertional mutagenesis may optimize the overall retrieval of integrations which are responsible for the cellular transformation and minimize the detection of integrations that occurred in the tumor stroma or in the parenchymal nontumoral cells that can be collected within the tumoral mass together with neoplastic cells."

Briefly, for LV\u2013transduced samples, quantitative Taqman PCR was performed using control samples with known vector copy number \\(defined with a different approach, such as Southern Blotting)\n3\n3) Set up a 50-\u03bcl reaction linear PCR initiated from 5\u2032-biotinylated vector-specific primer LTRIa and LTRIb as follows:\r\n\n\n10\u00d7 Taq polymerase reaction buffer 5 \u03bcl \r\n\n\nTemplate DNA \\(0.01\u201310,000 ng) x \u03bcl\r\n\n\ndNTPs \\(200 \u03bcM each) 1 \u03bcl \r\n\n\nTaq polymerase \\(2.5 U/\u03bcl) 0.5 \u03bcl\r\n\n\nPrimer LTRIa \\(0.5 pmol/\u03bcl) 0.25 \u03bcl \r\n\n\nPrimer LTRIb \\(0.5 pmol/\u03bcl) 0.25 \u03bcl \r\n\n\ndH2O 43 \u2013 x \u03bcl\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTo favor the amplification of integrations occurring in the putatively oligoclonal tumor parenchyma over the ones occurring in the tumoral stroma and contaminating surrounding tissue, we used an ad hoc\u2013designed LAM-PCR amplification protocol that uses limiting amounts of DNA to favor the amplification and retrieval of dominant insertions. The optimal amount of DNA for tumoral samples was defined empirically by using different quantities of DNA from tumors with a previously measured VCN. Since we expect the tumors to be mono or oligoclonal, we chose the minimal DNA quantity that resulted in the generation of few discrete bands, each representing a different LV insertion\n\\(Fig.1)\n.   \r\n\n\nAccording to these criteria, for tumor samples we used different amounts of DNA as template for LAM-PCR, according to the VCN that was detected in the sample by qPCR: 100 ng if VCN < 1; 50 ng if VCN \u2265 1 and \u2264 3; 10 ng if VCN > 3. For nontumoral samples, 100 ng of DNA was always used as template for LAM-PCR.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4) Perform the linear amplification \\(assembled as described above) using the following PCR program. \r\n\n\n   Initial denaturation 95\u00b0C 5\u2019\r\n\n\na) Denaturation 95\u00b0C 1\u2019\r\n\n\nb) Annealing 60\u00b0C 45\u2019\u2019\r\n\n\nc) Elongation 72\u00b0C 1\u201930\u2019\u2019\r\n\n\nRepeat from a) to c) for 25 cycles\r\n\n\nFinal Elongation 72\u00b0C 10\u2019\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5) Perform the Magnetic capture, Double-stranded DNA synthesis, Restriction Digest, Linker Ligation, Denaturation and Nested PCR as described in the canonical LAM-PCR protocol\n1\nusing oligos for HIV-derived lentiviral vectors.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6) For visualization of the LAM-PCR products, separate 5 \u03bcl of the second exponential amplification on a high-resolution Spreadex gel according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations\n\\(Fig. 2)\n. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7) Products of the second exponential amplification were tagged and then sequenced at high throughput with the 454 GS Flx platform \\(Roche). For these oligoclonal hepatocellular carcinomas, an average of 300 sequencing reads for each of the 2 PCR products \\(digested respectively with Tsp509I and HpyCH4IV) were performed, and resulted in the univocal mapping of an average of 6 integrations per sample\n4\n."

A PCR product that starts from the known sequence of the vector and extends through the unknown flanking genome is generated and sequenced to identify the position within the genome of the vector integration. Here we describe the adaption and exploitation of LAM-PCR for the retrieval of lentiviral vector \\(LV) integrations from oligoclonal hepatocellular carcinomas induced by LV-based insertional mutagenesis<sup>4</sup>.",
