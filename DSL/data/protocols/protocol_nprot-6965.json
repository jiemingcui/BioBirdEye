            "content": "In our article, \"Inequality as information: Wealth homophily facilitates the evolution of cooperation,\" we report findings from computer simulations that study an evolutionary game theory model across various parameter settings. The simulation was written in Python and we include that computer code with this protocol. Files containing Python code are named such that users can readily discern their relationship to results reported in the article. The simulation produced data that we analyzed using the statistical programming language R; the materials associated with this protocol include those data and the R code used to analyze them. In our R code, we provide excerpts from the main text of the article to indicate the relationship between sections of the computer code and results reported in the manuscript. Also, the names of data files imported and analyzed in the R code are consistent with the names of the data files associated with this protocol, thus allowing users to identify the data files that were used in each portion of the analyses. Together, these materials facilitate the replication of results reported in the article."

To perform simulations:\r\n\n\n  1. Open Python computer code.\r\n\n\n  2. Replace file directories in Python code to local directories on your system.\r\n\n\n  3. Run Python code.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nII. To replicate statistical analyses:\r\n\n\n  1. Download all data sets associated with this protocol.\r\n\n\n  2. Open R code.\r\n\n\n  3. Replace file directories in R code to the local directories in which data were downloaded in Step 1. \r\n\n\n  4. Run R code."
