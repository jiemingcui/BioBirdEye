            "content": "Many biological functions are mediated by protein-protein interactions \\(PPIs) or protein-nucleic interactions that are key molecular interactions in both normal biology disease. These can be inhibited with a number of macromolecules \\(macrodrugs to distinguish them from conventional drugs \\(1,2) such as intracellular antibody fragments. \r\n\n\nThe use of intracellular antibodies to perturb the function of protein function in vivo was first shown using whole antibodies and antibody fragment comprising variable regions \\(V) in the form of single chain Fv \\(scFv) \\(3). Subsequently, antibody fragment variants have described for use as intracellular antibodies, including our own use of human single domain antibodies \\(designated iDAbs) made of either heavy \\(H) chain variable regions \\(VH iDAbs) or light \\(L) chain variable regions \\(VL iDAbs) \\(4,5). \r\n\n\nAn advantage of iDAbs is the single domain has only three complementary determining regions \\(CDRs) allowing for easy affinity maturation, their small size  \\(~12KD) and can, in principle, bind to antigen regions such as crevices, that scFv or whole antibody cannot reach. We have developed a method to select intracellular antibodies using yeast cell selections, called Intracellular Antibody Capture \\(IAC). IAC was first developed using scFv \\(6) and later adapted for iDAb selection \\(4). The advantage of the IAC method is that it is not necessary to immunise animals to obtain antibodies, which obviates the welfare issue of using animals and also avoids the problem of developing antibodies against self antigens and conserved antigens. Finally, using an in-cell selection means that the iDAbs are selected in reducing conditions that facilitates the selection of appropriately folded domain antibodies.\r\n\n\nWe previously developed an iDAb-based IAC method \\(7). This was adapted to single VH iDAb libraries with CDR3 lengths of 10, 12 and 15 amino acids and for affinity maturation through sequential CDR2 and CDR1 randomization and screening \\(8). The current protocol online is the refinement of the methods described in Nature Protocols \\(7). The steps involved are summarised in Figure1."

Clone the antigen \\(bait) cDNA as an in-frame fusion with LexA DNA-binding domain in pBTM116 vector using standard genetic cloning methods.\r\n  2. Streak L40 yeast from glycerol stock onto YPAD agar plate and leave to grow for 2-3 days at 30 \u00b0C. \r\n  Tip: Yeast will not grow sufficiently when inoculate from glycerol stock directly into liquid culture. \r\n\n\n3. A day before yeast transformation, inoculate a single colony into 2 ml of YPAD medium and incubate overnight with shaking \\(~225 rpm) at 30 \u00b0C.\r\n  4. Measure the OD600 of the overnight culture and calculate the volume required to dilute this culture to give an OD600 between 0.15-0.2 in 10 ml of YPAD medium.\r\n  Tip: Dilute the overnight culture 1:10 before measuring the OD600 to give an accurate reading.\r\n\n\n5. Culture at 30 \u00b0C with shaking \\(~225 rpm) until the OD600 reaches 0.4-0.5.\r\n  Tip: Transformation efficiency is reduced when the OD600 is near or above 0.6.\r\n\n\n6. Pellet the yeast culture by centrifugation for 5 minutes, 1,000g at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  Tip: Once the desired OD600 is obtained, keep the yeast culture on ice to slow down further growth.\r\n\n\n7. Remove the medium and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of sterile Milli-Q H2O.\r\n  8. Centrifuge again for 5 minutes, 1,000g at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  9. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the final yeast pellet in 100 \u03bcl of freshly made, sterile TE-LiAc. This is the competent yeast cells than can be kept on ice for 2-3 hours.\r\n  10. Denature the salmon sperm DNA by incubating at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes and chill on ice immediately for at least 2 minutes.\r\n  11. Mix 200 ng of bait plasmid and denatured 100 \u03bcg of salmon sperm carrier DNA in a sterile 1.5 ml microtube.\r\n  12. Add the DNA mixture from step 11 to 100 \u03bcl of competent yeast and mix by flicking the tube.\r\n  13. Add 600 \u03bcl of freshly prepared sterile PEG-LiAc-TE solution and mix inverting the tube several times.\r\n  Critical: It is strongly recommended that TE-LiAc and PEG-TE-LiAc mixtures are prepared fresh for each transformation as the quality of Li-Ac and PEG will affect transformation efficiency.\r\n\n\n14. Incubate for 30 minutes at 30 \u00b0C with shaking at 225 rpm.\r\n  15. Add 70 \u03bcl of DMSO and mix gently by inversion.\r\n  16. Heat shock for 15 minutes in 42 \u00b0C water bath.\r\n  17. Place on ice for 2 minutes, fill the microtube with sterile Milli-Q H2O and pellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 3,000g, RT.\r\n  18. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100 \u03bcl of sterile 1xTE. Plate 50 \u03bcl of the transformed yeast onto a 10 cm YC-W \\(i.e. lacking tryptophan) plate.\r\n  19. Incubate the plate for 2-3 days at 30 \u00b0C.\r\n  Pause Point: These yeast plates are stable for at least one week when wrapped with parafilm and stored at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nValidation of bait expression from LexA-antigen fusion plasmid in yeast\r\n\n\n20. Pick a single yeast colony from the YC-W plate from step 19 into 5 ml of YC-W media in a 50 ml falcon tube and resuspend by vortexing.\r\n  Critical: Test several formed clones because of the possible heterogeneity of the LexA-bait fusion protein expression level.\r\n\n\nCritical: Good aeration is required for yeast to grow efficiently and a smaller size falcon tube will compromise this.\r\n\n\n21. For short-term storage of bait-containing yeast clones streak a small amount from step 19 onto YC-W plate and incubate for 2-3 days at 30 \u00b0C.\r\n  Pause Point: The yeast plate is stable for at least one week when wrapped with parafilm and stored at 4 \u00b0C. This can be used as a source for screening libraries after checking for the bait expression.\r\n\n\n22. Culture the single colonies from step 21 overnight at 30 \u00b0C with shaking at 225 rpm.\r\n  23. Take 500 \u03bcl of the overnight culture for protein analysis and freeze the remaining culture for long-term storage by adding 1x volume of 30% \\(v/v) sterile glycerol solution.\r\n  24. Centrifuge 500 \u03bcl of yeast culture from step 23 for 1 minute at 3,000g. \r\n  25. Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet in 500 \u03bcl Milli-Q H2O and centrifuge again for 1 minute at 3,000g .\r\n  26. Resuspend the pellet in 300 \u03bcl of Milli-Q H2O and then equal volume of 0.6M NaOH, mix well.\r\n  Critical Step: This two-step procedure is important as direct suspension of cells in 0.3M NaOH causes inefficient extraction.\r\n\n\n27. Incubates cells at RT for 10 minutes.\r\n  28. Centrifuge the cells for 1 minute at 3,000g.\r\n  29. Carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend in 20 \u03bcl of 5% SDS.\r\n  30. Add 20 \u03bcl 2x SDS-PAGE buffer and boil the sample for 5 minutes.\r\n  31. Load 20 \u03bcl of the supernatant for western blot \\(a general western blot method is described elsewhere). Detect the fusion bait protein using anti-LexA antibody.\r\n  \r\n\n\nAssessing auto-activation- by the LexA-bait fusion protein\r\n\n\n32. Streak a single colony from the established bait line from step 21 onto a new YC-W plate and incubate for 2-3 days at 30 \u00b0C.\r\n  33. Pick a single colony into 100 \u03bcl of sterile 1xTE, resuspend with a pipette.\r\n  34. Use sterile inoculating loops to re-streak the yeast from step 33 onto a series of YC-WH plates containing various concentrations of 3-AT \\(ranging from 0-50 mM)\r\n  35. Incubate for 2-3 days at 30\u00b0C.\r\n  36. Assess yeast growth to determine the minimal concentration of 3-AT that prevents self-activation.\r\n  \r\n\n\nFirst round of screening \u2013 Large scale yeast transformation\r\n\n\n37. Inoculate 5-10 colonies of the established bait strain from step 32 in 1 ml of autoclaved Milli-Q H2O in a sterile 15 ml falcon tube and resuspend by vortexing.\r\n  Critical Step: Ensure that there are no clumps of yeast as this will inhibit cell growth\r\n\n\n38.

Incubate at 30 \u00b0C with shaking at 225 rpm until the OD600 reaches between 0.4-0.5 \\(usually 3-4 hours)\r\n  45. Critical Step: The OD600 at the end of YPAD culture should not exceed 0.6 as transformation efficiency would drop beyond this OD600. \r\n  46. Transfer the yeast culture into 5x 225 ml conical tubes and pellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1000g at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  47.

            "content": "Yeast transformation efficiency. Low or no colonies on selection plates after yeast transformation are usually associated with:\r\n\n\n1. The quality of transformation reagents. As emphasized in the protocol, the TE-LiAc and PEG-TE-LiAc solutions must be made fresh on the day of transformation. The concentration of PEG3350 is critical for yeast transformation and when transformation is being carried out all reagents must be mixed well to create homogenous solution. An old stock solution of PEG3350 of more than 1 month should not be used as this could affect the final concentration of PEG \\(~32-33%) due to evaporation during storage. \r\n  2. OD600 at the start and end of culture. Starting OD600 of yeast culture should not exceed 0.2 when doing transformation as yeast requires to undergo at least one doubling. The transformation efficiency also significantly reduces when the harvesting point is near or above OD600 of 0.6. This is particularly critical when doing a large-scale transformation for the libraries.\r\n  3. Selective plate is incorrect. Always check the formulation of the plate and use media and plate that is less than one month old.\r\n  \r\n\n\nSub-library construction. Very few bacteria transformants could be due to:\r\n\n\n1. Ligation efficiency is low. The vector to insert ration should be around 1:3 for optimal ligation efficiency as specified in step 106. The T4 ligation buffer must not be repeatedly freeze/thawed as this degrades the ATP component in the buffer. Ensure complete digestion of pVP16* vector to prevent self-ligation and verify that the PCR insert have the correct molecular weight after SfiI and NotI digestion as stated in step 104.\r\n  2. Low competency of E.coli. Test the efficiency of competent cells with supercoiled plasmid \\(e.g. pUC19) and optimize the amount of ligated reaction added to an aliquot of competent cells. It may be necessary to do several transformations to obtain the library size of >1x106. \r\n  \r\n\n\nYeast plasmid extraction. No or poor plasmid yield could be caused by improper growth of yeast. Ensure that the yeast is grown in YC-L media \\(to enforce selective pressure on the \u201cprey\u201d \\(leucine-synthesizing pVP16*)."

A rule of thumb is that 20-50 transformants are obtained with a bait length of 100 amino acids that does not cause some auto-activation and growth on histidine-minus plates."
