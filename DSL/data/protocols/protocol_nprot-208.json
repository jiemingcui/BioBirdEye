            "content": "Isolation of good quality RNA from plant tissues such as mangosteen is troublesome and challenging because they are rich in secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds and polysaccharides that coprecipitate with nucleic acids. The phenolic substances interact irreversibly with nucleic acids and proteins<sup>1</sup>, leading to their oxidation and degradation<sup>2</sup> and finally render RNA unsuitable for downstream purposes. \r\n\n\nPreviously, two RNA extraction protocols have been tried on mangosteen tissues i.e. the methods described by Rochester _et al._ <sup>3</sup> and Matsumura _et al._ <sup>4</sup>, respectively; however, the RNA isolated were partially degraded, brown in color and difficult to dissolve \\(Figure 1 a-b, Table 1). This may due to the browning effect<sup>1</sup>, whereby a brown color supernatant is developed upon oxidation of the homogenate. The poor quality of RNA may attribute to coprecipitation of polysaccharides and oxidation of phenolic compounds that interact irreversibly with nucleic acids<sup>1,2</sup>. \r\n\n\nIn this study, a method was developed to isolate good quality RNA from leaves and flowers of mangosteen. In this method, polyvinylpyrrolidone \\(PVP) was added in the extraction buffer, so that it can bind to the phenolic compounds which are then eliminated by ethanol precipitation. The protocol described here is simple, fast and does not require ultracentrifugation."

            "content": "PVP is an inhibitor of polyphenol oxidase which can prevent browning effect<sup>6,7</sup> and its use in the removal of secondary metabolites from nucleic acid has been widely reported<sup>8,9,10</sup>. In this study, the use of PVP in the extraction buffer renders a significant improvement in both yield and quality of RNA as compared to that obtained from other methods \\(Figure 1, Table 1). The RNA extracted by the modified method showed two distinct rRNAs with no degradation. The protocol developed in this study also gave the best quality of RNA for mangosteen, the A<sub>260/280</sub> and A<sub>260/230</sub> obtained were 1.79 and 2.75, respectively \\(Table 1, Figure 2), indicating minimum contamination from proteins and polysaccharides in the RNA isolated. There was no severe browning of RNA observed during LiCl precipitation. Furthermore, with this modification, this improved method can be completed within three to four hours as compared to the six to seven hours of the original protocol<sup>4</sup>. Table 2 shows that the mature leaf, flower of more than 2 cm, and fully open flower gave lower yield and quality of RNA compared to the other tissues. Mature leaves may possess higher levels of secondary cell wall materials that contribute to fresh weight, thus reducing the cell number per g of tissue and decreasing the amount of RNA per gram fresh weight. Similarly, the low yield of total RNA from flower more than 2 cm and fully open flower is likely because these stages have a bigger average cell size and lower cell number as compared to the same fresh weight of close floral buds.\r\n\n\nWe also showed that the modified protocol described herein produced total RNA of sufficient quality for RT-PCR of a housekeeping gene, cyclophilin with the expected size of approximately 320 bp \\(Figure 2). A cDNA library of 9 X 108 pfu/mL and a subtractive cDNA library were also successfully constructed by using the RNA extracted by using this protocol \\(data not shown).\r\n\n\nIn conclusion, the modified method developed in this study allowed the isolation of intact, high yield and quality RNA from mangosteen leaves and flowers and may be other plant tissues with high phenolic compounds and polysaccharides, for RT-PCR and library constructions. This method is effective, simple and can be completed within four hours and does not require ultracentrifugation."
