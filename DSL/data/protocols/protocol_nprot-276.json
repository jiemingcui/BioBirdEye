            "content": "Membrane remodeling is an important process implicated in several cellular functions including compartmentalization and membrane and protein trafficking. Amphiphysin 2 \\(BIN1) and dynamin 2 \\(DNM2) are membrane tubulating proteins, that are mutated in recessive and dominant centronuclear myopathy, respectively \\(refs 1-4). The overexpression of a muscle isoform of BIN1 \\(iso 8) in COS-1 cells provokes a striking rearrangement of membranes into long tubules. The large GTPase DNM2 is recruited to these membrane tubules through interaction between its proline-rich domain and the SH3 domain of BIN1. This protocol allows to create and visualise BIN1-induced membrane tubules in cultured cells, and to test the recruitment of DNM2 to the tubules."

Dilute the cells 1:4 in same medium and spread on 22 mm\n2\nglasses into 6 wells tissue culture plate. Let them adhere and grow 5 hrs at 37\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Mix in this order 100 microl. DMEM \\(without glucose nor FCS) with 3 microl. Fugene-6 transfection reagent and 1 microg. of plasmids DNA encoding the proteins of interest, pEGFP-BIN1 iso 8 and pSG5 Myc-tagged-DNM2 in this study. Incubate 10 min at room temperature, then add to cells in 1 ml DMEM + 1g/L glucose + 5% FCS. Incubate overnight at 37\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Immunofluorescence**\r\n\n\n3. Wash cells with PBS once, then fix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde 20 min to overnight at 4\u00b0C. \r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Quench with NH\n4\nCl 50mM 15 min.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Wash cells with PBS 5 min before permeabilisation with PBS + 0.2% Triton 10 min. Wash cells with PBS 5 min.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Saturate non specific immunoglobulin binding sites with PBS +  0.1% Triton + 10% FCS for 1 hr. Wash cells with PBS 5 min.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Dilute primary antibody \\(anti-Myc) 1:400 in PBS + 0.1% Triton + 3% FCS. Transfer the 22 mm\n2\nglasses carrying cells into a humid chamber \\(parafilm surrounded by water drops is enough) to avoid drying of the small volumes during the following incubations. This procedure allows the use of a small amount of antibodies, as a drop covering the cells on the glasses. Incubate cells on 22 mm\n2\nglasses with primary antibody dilution for 1 hr at room temperature. Wash cells three times with PBS + 0.1% Triton  for 5-10 min.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. Dilute secondary antibody \\(Goat anti Mouse Cy3) 1:200 in PBS + 0.1% Triton + 3% FCS, and incubate on cells for 45 min at room temperature. \r\n  \r\n\n\n9. Wash cells three times with PBS + 0.1% Triton  for 5-10 min, then once with PBS for 5-10 min. Mount glasses on microscope slides \\(cells facing the slides) with a drop of anti-fading solution, that keeps cells from drying and protect from fluorescence fading.\r\n  \r\n\n\n10. Use a confocal microscope with an Argon 488 excitation to visualize the GFP-BIN1 positive membrane tubules and a HeNe 543 excitation for the red Myc-DNM2 localization."

The formation of these tubules depends on a functional N-BAR domain, and missense mutations of this domain, found in patients with autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy, abrogate their formation \\(ref.  4).\r\n\n\nThe recruitment of dynamin 2 to these tubules could be monitored by confocal microscopy; while overexpressed dynamin 2 is diffuse in the cytoplasm, it is recruited to and colocalizes with BIN1 on the membrane tubules. This recruitment depends on the presence of a functional SH3 domain in BIN1, as either deletion of this domain, or a premature stop codon reproducing a mutation found in a patient with autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy, do not allow the recruitment of dynamin 2, while membrane tubules are still formed.\r\n\n\nThis procedure may be applied to test the impact of other mutations in BIN1 and/or dynamin 2, and to test the tubulation and dynamin-recruitment properties of other proteins."

COS-1 cells were transfected with BIN1-iso1 (neuronal isoform), and GFP-tagged BIN1-iso8 (skeletal isoform) wild-type and mutants. Mutants included mutations found in centronuclear myopathy patients in the BAR domain (K35N and D151N) and in the SH3 domain (K575X). Overexpressed BIN1-iso1 was detected with the anti-BIN1 C99D antibody and BIN1-iso8 constructs were fused to GFP. BIN1-iso8 wild-type and K575X constructs induce membrane tubulation contrary to BIN1-iso1 and BAR domain mutants. (b) Dynamin 2 recruitment to BIN1-iso8 induced membrane tubules. COS-1 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged dynamin 2 and different GFP-tagged BIN1 constructs: wild-type and mutated full length BIN1-iso8 and wild-type BAR* (aa 1-282, lacking the SH3 domain at the C-terminus). Dynamin 2 localization was revealed with an anti-Myc antibody. Dynamin 2 recruitment to the membrane tubules induced by BIN1-iso8 was dependent on a wild-type SH3 domain, as both deletion of the SH3 domain or the last 19 aminoacids (K575X mutant) abrogated the recruitment. The bottom panel shows merge pictures of cells expressing DNM2 together with BAR domain mutants or DNM2 alone. Scale bar = 10 microm.
