            "content": "<p>For the analysis of (differential) gene expression or for the determination of translational efficiencies it is necessary to quantify the levels of specific transcripts. A variety of methods are available, e.g. qRT-PCR(or RT-qPCR) and Northern blot analyses for single transcripts [1;2]. For highly parallel quantification of many transcripts RNA-Seq or DNA microarray analysis can be used. Northern blot analysis offers several important advantages in comparison to qRT-PCR, i.e. 1) the size of the transcript is determined and only non-degraded full-length transcripts are quantified, 2) it is clarified whether the gene of interest is transcribed into one specific transcript or whether several transcripts of different lengths exist (e.g. monocistronic and polycistronic), and 3) no expensive equipment is needed.</p>"

            "content": "Probe labeling with Dig-dUTP\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the desired DNA sequence for probe generation is amplified via a \u201cnormal\u201d PCR reaction. If necessary, the PCR fragment is purified. It is used as a template for the labelling reaction.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The labeling takes place via a second PCR reaction with Dig-dUTP (1\u00b5l/ 100\u00b5l PCR reaction) and a LowT dNTP-mix to ensure efficient incorporation of the label. The elongation time should be twice as long as for a \u201cnormal\u201d PCR, because the incorporation of Dig-dUTP is slower than that of unlabeled nucleotides.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The incorporation of the label is verified by analytical gel electrophoresis, the probe must have a higher apparent molecular weight than an unlabeled negative control.\nDenaturing RNA gel electrophoresis\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare a denaturing RNA gel. The example is given for a gel of 8 cm x 12 cm with a volume of 80 ml. 0.8 g \u2013 1.6 g agarose are taken to yield concentrations of 1% (w/v) \u2013 2 % (w/v), depending on the size of the transcript that should be detected. The agarose is dissolved in 70 ml H\n2\nO\nDEPC\nby heating in a microwave oven. When the temperature of the solution is below 70\no\nC, 8 ml 10x MOPS buffer and 3 ml 37% formaldehyde are added. When the temperature has dropped below 60\no\nC, the solution is poured into a gel sled and a comb is added.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put the hardened agarose gel into a horizontal gel electrophoresis system with 1x MOPS buffer as running buffer.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mix the RNA samples (2-5 \u00b5g) and the RiboRuler RNA size marker (1\u00b5l) with three volumes of RNA loading buffer. Heat the samples to 60\u00b0C for 10 minutes to denature RNAs, and subsequently put them on ice to inhibit refolding.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apply the samples to the gel and run for 2h at 100V.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the gel run, verify the integrity and the amounts of the ribosomal RNAs (23S, 16S). Document the gel picture, because the rRNA amounts of the different samples are used for normalization.\nBlotting the RNA gel to a nylon membrane\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The transfer of the RNAs from the gel to a nylon membrane occurs via downward capillary blotting. One or a few hours are sufficient, nevertheless, usually the blotting is performed overnight. Figure 1 gives an overview of the blotting setup; the following points give a step by step description.\n10.\u00a0Cut 15 sheets of 1.5 mm thick blotting paper in the size of the gel and place them on a RNase free surface.\n11.\u00a0Cut 3 sheets of 0.35 mm thick blotting paper in the size of the gel and equilibrated them 20x SSC buffer. Add them on top of the pile.\n12.\u00a0Soak the Nylon membrane in distilled water for 10 minutes, then equilibrate them in 20x SSC buffer. Put the membrane on top of the pile.\n13.\u00a0Put the gel on top of the membrane. Make sure that no air bubbles are trapped between gel and membrane.\n14.\u00a0Equilibrate three 0.35 mm thick gel-sized blotting paper in 20x SSC buffer. Add them on top of the gel. Again, remove air bubbles if necessary.\n15.\u00a0The last layer on pile is a buffer bridge, which is also cut from the 0.35 mm thick blotting paper (12cm x 30cm) and is equilibrated in 20x SSC buffer. It is placed on top of the pile, and both ends are given into two buffer reservoirs.\n16.\u00a0\u00a0The gel slay is placed on top of the pile to inhibit drying of the buffer bridge. A weight (e.g. a filled 250 ml Schott bottle) is placed on top to guarantee good contact between all layers.\n17.\u00a0Typically the blot runs overnight.\n18.\u00a0The positions of the gel pockets are marked on the membrane with a pencil before removing the gel.\n19.\u00a0Both membrane and gel are documented after the blotting to verify complete transfer of the two rRNAs as a proxy for transfer for all RNAs. The RNAs are cross-linked to the membrane with UV irradiation at 260 nm (Stratalinker, 120 mJ).\n20.\u00a0The membrane is stained with methylene blue to visualize the RNA size marker. The positions of the size marker fragments are marked with a pencil. The membrane can be directly used for hybridization, or it can be dried and stored for later use.\nHybridization of the membrane\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put the blotted membrane into a hybridization tube with 10 ml hybridization buffer and 120 \u00b5g/ml yeast tRNA, incubate for 60 minutes at 50\u00b0C in the hybridization oven with slow rotation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a030 \u00b5l of Dig-labelled probe is incubated at 95\no\nC for 5 minutes to denature the probe, and then cooled on ice to inhibit renaturation. It is given to 10 ml hybridization buffer. The probe-free hybridization solution is removed from the hybridization tube and is discarded. The solution with the probe is added, and the tube is mounted again in the hybridization oven. It is incubated at 50\no\nC overnight with slow rotation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hybridization solution with the probe is removed from the hybridization tube. It can be stored at -20\u00b0C and reused several times. Each time the probe has to be denatured before it is given to another membrane.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The membrane is washed twice for 5 minutes at room temperature with 50 ml 2x SSC buffer + 0.1% (w/v) SDS at high rotation.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The membrane is then washed twice for 15 minutes at 50\u00b0C with 1x SSC buffer + 0.5% (w/v) SDS again at high rotation speed.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The membrane is then incubated once in freshly prepared wash buffer, and it is transferred to 20 ml blocking solution and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and slow rotation.\nQuantifying the specific transcript level\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01 \u00b5l anti-Dig-AP antibody are given to 20 ml blocking solution. The mixture is incubated with the membrane for 30 minutes at room temperature under slow rotation.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The membrane is washed three times for 10 minutes in 60 ml wash buffer at room temperature and fast rotation.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The membrane is equilibrated in 20 ml detection buffer at room temperature for 5 minutes under slow rotation.\n10.\u00a0The membrane is transferred to a tray of suitable size. 15 ml of CDP-star working solution are added, and it is incubated for 5 minutes with shaking under low light conditions. The CDP-Star working solution can be reused when stored at 4\u00b0C in the dark.\n11.\u00a0The membrane is placed between two sheets of transparent foil. Light emission is detected via exposition a Hyperfilm\nTM\nECL. The film is developed until signals are visible and fixed.\n12.\u00a0For signal quantification the film is scanned with an 8-bit scanner. The open source software\u00a0ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/) is used for signal quantification."
