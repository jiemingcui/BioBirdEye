            "content": "<p>\tThe tumor suppressor protein, TP53 (p53), is critical for cell health and is often deregulated in cancer. Its primary role is to detect stress signals and assist with DNA damage response in the cell\u2019s nucleus. As such, mutations in the&nbsp;<em>p53</em>gene can influence tumor progression and reoccurrence.<sup>2,3</sup>The primary sequence of the protein consists of three main regions including the N-terminal domain (NTD), DNA-binding domain (DBD), and the C-terminal domain (CTD). Crystallographic studies have generally focused on the DBD of p53 as this region is the most stable and contains multiple cancer-related mutations.<sup>4</sup>Structural information for the NTD and CTD remains limited due to their flexible nature.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Numerous biochemical studies have shed light on functional aspects of each domain and identified prominent binding partners.<sup>3,6</sup>&nbsp;A larger framework is still needed, however, to truly grasp how mutations in p53 disrupt in its structure and function in cells. To advance our understanding of native p53 assemblies, we developed new tools described here and in our recently publish work.<sup>1</sup></p><p>\tCryo-electron microscopy (EM) is an optimal method to study protein structures that cannot be easily deciphered using other techniques. Advancements in hardware and equipment have contributed to the \u201cresolution revolution\u201d in the EM field. To help address specimen-related challenges, here we present a highly effective protocol to isolate native p53 complexes from human cancer cells suitable for cryo-EM analysis. The samples revealed new structures of p53 monomer (~50 kDa) and functional tetramer (~200 kDa).<sup>1</sup>These higher-resolution structures provided a putative new model for the NTD and defines ubiquitination sites on the protein while bound to DNA. Equally important, our protocol may be used to study native p53 structures from many different cancer cell lines.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Overview of the Procedure</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) is a commonly used protein enrichment technique that employs Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) matrices. This technique takes advantage of the strong binding affinity between the chelated Ni-NTA functional group and a stretch of continuous histidine residues found in recombinant or native proteins. Ni-NTA agarose beads or other IMAC purification systems can also have a more versatile use in protein purification. For example, proteins that are rich in post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, are known to interact with metal cations<sup>7,8</sup>. Heavy metal uptake in cells is a grave danger to phosphate-rich genetic material and is the cause of acute poisoning, environmental toxicity, and even cancer<sup>9</sup>. We can exploit the phosphorylation-rich nature of p53 to extract it from the nuclear material of human cancer cells and enrich the native protein through Ni-NTA chromatography. This simple, but effective protocol may serve as a new means to investigate authentic p53 structures from many different cancer cells. Here, we provide detailed information for the extraction, purification and enrichment steps of the protein from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (U87MG line), suitable for downstream EM sample preparation (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). We also provide examples of cryo-EM structures of p53 tetramer assemblies (<strong>Figure 2</strong>).&nbsp;</p>"

Verification through SDS-PAGE analysis in conjunction with Coomassie blue staining and western blotting is needed to determine which fractions yield the best protein sample for downstream structural studies.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualization through cryo-EM</strong></p><p>\tFor cryo-EM specimen preparation, we followed the protocol detailed in the compliment paper that describes the sample application and vitrification of Silicon Nitride (SiN) microchips.<sup>1</sup>Here, SiN microchips were prepared with a monolayer of lipids containing 25% Ni-NTA-chelated groups and 75% DLPC. Sample was added to the monolayer (2 \u00b5L of native p53 eluate at a concentration of 0.02 mg/mL). EM specimens were imaged using a Talos F200C EM (ThermoFisher Scientific) operating at 200 kV under low-dose conditions (~5 electrons/A<sup>2</sup>/sec).&nbsp;&nbsp;Images were recorded using a CMOS camera (ThermoFisher Scientific) with a pixel size of 14 \u00b5m at a magnification of 92,000x. Due to the polymeric identity of p53, a homogenous mixture will not be initially evident but computation software can to differentiate particle identity.</p><p>\t</p><p><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structural determination of p53</strong></p><p>     SDS-PAGE analysis determined tetramer assemblies that had migrated at ~200 kDa. We used RELION software package to perform single particle image processing to determine p53 model assemblies. Tetramer structures were easily separated using 3D classification after 25 iterations. Tetramer dimensions were consistent with particles in the raw images and were easily visualized in class averages. The ~7-\u00c5 reconstruction was not limited in particle orientations although some preferences were noted. The EM structure contained 4 distinct domains. Multiple models were used to interpret each domain of the tetramer assembly.<sup>1</sup>Initially, we used the crystal structure of the DBD to interpret the lower half of the density map (dark blue, pdb code 2AC0, all chains)<sup>10</sup>. Using the I-TASSER protein server, we modeled a putative NTD with a C-score of \u20131.81, which had a medium confidence but still allowed us to interpret the EM map.<sup>11</sup>These domains were placed in the biologically-relevant density adjacent to the DBD in accordance with our previously reported p53 monomer structure.<sup>1</sup>Finally, the upper region of the map had additional density which was attributed to ubiquitin moieties, consistent with a lower resolution model of p53 dimers.<sup>12</sup>These single ubiquitin chains (8 kDa) were proximal to residue K24 in the NTD of p53. Residue K24 was previously identified as a site of ubiquitination during DNA repair. Remaining smaller regions of density were attributed to flexible PTMs that cannot be modeled at this resolution.&nbsp;</p><p>\tFinally, the DNA fragment within the tetramer assembly showed features consistent with a double stranded break in the middle of the helical strand. These results suggest that we have captured ubiquitinated-p53 tetramer assemblies primed for DNA repair. We expect complementary biochemical experiments to shed light on the mechanistic details of tetramer formation and function. Overall, these procedures highlight the versatility of the protocol and its potential impact for advancing structural oncology studies.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

(C) Ni-NTA agarose resin used to enrich phosphorylated-p53 from the nuclear material of U87MG cells. SDS-PAGE and western blots show and enrichment of p53 monomers (~50 kDa) and tetramers (~200 kDa). (D) Enriched p53 fractions were incubated on SiN microchips decorated with Ni-NTA substrate. These microchips can be vitrified and imaged using cryo-EM. Scale bar is 25 nm.

Sadly, mutations in the TP53 gene are involved in nearly ~50% of tumors,</p><p>spurring erratic cell growth and disease progression. Until recently, structural information</p><p>for p53 remained incomplete and there are limited studies on native p53 produced in</p><p>human tumors. Here, we present a highly reproducible and effective protocol to extract,</p><p>enrich, and purify native p53 protein assemblies from cancer cells for downstream</p><p>structural studies. This method does not introduce purification tags into the p53 gene and</p><p>maintains naturally occurring modifications. In conjunction with cryo-Electron Microscopy</p><p>techniques, we determined new structures for p53 monomers (~50 kDa) and tetramers</p><p>(~200 kDa) at spatial resolutions of ~4.8 \u00c5 and ~7 \u00c5, respectively.1 These models</p><p>revealed new insights for flexible regions of p53 along with biologically-relevant</p><p>ubiquitination sites. Combining biochemical and structural imaging protocols, we aim to</p><p>build a better understanding of native p53\u2019s impact in cancer formation.</p>",
