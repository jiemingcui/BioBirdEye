These organoids are widely used for modelling key characteristics of organs and tissues to better understand various aspects of human disease such as cancer. However, current organoids are still limited because such model systems fail to account for a large number of factors, including native tissue architecture and surrounding microenvironment<sup>1,2,5</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we report the 3D reconstitution of normal bladder and patient-specific bladder tumour \u201cassembloids\u201d - organoids derived from tissue stem/tumour cells reconstituted with other components of the tissue stroma/microenvironment such as stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and muscle cells.</p>"

Prepare two sheets of Parafilm at the size of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm, put them in a 100 mm petri dish.\n* Spray your gloves and the Parafilm with 70 % (vol/vol) ethanol.\n2. Prepare long-term bladder organoids.\na. Release the bladder organoids from Matrigel drop by physically pipetting the organoid medium and collect them in a new 15 ml tube.\nb. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, for 5 min.\nc. Remove the supernatant, wash the organoid pellets with 1 ml of Advanced DMEM/F12 medium.\nd. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, for 5 min.\ne. Remove the supernatant, add 1-2 ml of DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin.\nf. Transfer the organoids with medium to the 35 mm petri dish, plate the dish on ice.\n3. Prepare MEF and HULEC mixture.\na. Prepare 1.5 x 10\n6\nMEF and 2 x 10\n5\nHULEC, put together in one microcentrifuge tube.\nb. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, for 3 min.\nc. Remove the supernatant, add 40 \u03bcl Matrigel to cell pellets (perform on ice), plate on ice\n4. Set 20p pipette at 4 \u03bcl, take one organoid only.\n* Take < 1 \u03bcl of organoid (+ medium that follows when picking the organoid) while holding it.\n5. Take up to 4 \u03bcl of MEF and HULEC mixture.\n* Mix the MEF and HULEC mixture well before taking the mixture.\n6. Make the Matrigel droplet (containing an organoid, MEF, and HULEC) on a sheet of Parafilm.\n7. Place the organoid in the center of the droplet by gently pipetting the Matrigel droplet.\n8. Repeat the procedure 6-7 to generate 10 droplets.\n* Make 5 droplets on each sheet. This generates 10 droplets on 2 sheets.\n9. Incubate at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 5-10 min to solidify the gel.\n10. Remove the droplets from the Parafilm using a fine forceps, put them in a 12-well version of spinning bioreactor containing 2 ml of pre-warmed assembloid medium.\n* Put 5-7 droplets in each well of 12-well plate.\n11. Culture the droplets (= organoid with stroma) in a spinning bioreactor in 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5.0 % CO\n2\nfor two days.\n* If you don't have a 12-well version of spinning bioreactor, orbital shaker (95 rpm) can be alternatively used.\n12. Prepare two sheets of Parafilm at the size of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm, put them in a 100 mm petri dish.\n* Spray your gloves and the Parafilm with 70 % (vol/vol) ethanol.\n13. Prepare BSMC and HULEC mixture.\na. Prepare 6 x 10\n5\nBSMC and 6 x 10\n5\nHULEC, put together in one microcentrifuge tube.\nb. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, for 3 min.\nc. Remove the supernatant, add 20 \u03bcl Matrigel to cell pellets (perform on ice), plate on ice\n14. Take out the cultures of bladder organoid with stroma from the incubator, take each of them (+ medium that follows when picking the organoid with stroma) using 20p pipette, and put on a sheet of Parafilm.\n15. After removing the residual medium from the Parafilm, take 2 \u03bcl of BSMC and HULEC mixture using 20p pipette, put it on each of organoid with stroma to make the layered Matrigel droplet.\n* Place the organoid with stroma in the center of the droplet by genetly pipetting the Matrigel droplet.\n16. Repeat the procedure 14-15 to generate 10 droplets.\n* Make 5 droplets on each sheet. This generates 10 droplets on 2 sheets.\n17. Incubate at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 5-10 min to solidify the gel.\n18. Remove the droplets from the Parafilm using a fine forceps, put them in a 12-well version of spinning bioreactor containing 2 ml of pre-warmed assembloid medium.\n* Put 5-7 droplets in each well of 12-well plate.\n19. Culture the droplets (= assembloids) in a spinning bioreactor in 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5.0 % CO\n2\nfor seven days\n* Medium change: every other day\nGeneration of human bladder tumour assembloids\n* This protocol is standardized to a preparation of culture in 6 wells of 12-well plate (= 30 assembloids)\n*\u00a0A day before,\u00a0thaw 150 \u00b5l of Matrigel\u00a0overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\n* Prepare human bladder tumour organoids (~ 1000 organoids at day 10), patient-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), HULEC cultures in advance.\n1. Prepare six sheets of Parafilm at the size of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm, put them in a 100 mm petri dish.\n* Spray your gloves and the Parafilm with 70 % (vol/vol) ethanol.\n2. Prepare patient-derived human bladder tumour organoids.\na. Release the tumour organoids at day 10 from a Matrigel drop (generally contains 1,000 organoids) by physically pipetting the organoid medium and collect them in a new 15 ml tube.\nb. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, for 5 min.\nc. Remove the supernatant, add 1 ml of Advanced DMEM/F12 medium and transfer to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nd. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, for 5 min.\ne. Remove the supernatant, add 200 \u03bcl of Advanced DMEM/F12 medium, place on ice.\n3. Prepare CAF and HULEC.\na. Prepare 7.5 x 10\n6\nCAF and 6 x 10\n5\nHULEC.\n4. Put CAF and HULEC together in the microcentrifuge tube containing tumour organoids prepared above.\n5. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, for 3 min.\n6. Remove the supernatant, add 150 \u03bcl Matrigel and mix well (perform on ice)\n7. Take 5 \u03bcl of mixture containing tumour organoids, CAF, and HULEC and make the Matrigel droplets on a sheet of Parafilm.\n8. Repeat the procedure 7 to generate 30 droplets.\n* Make 5 droplets on each sheet. This generates 30 droplets on 6 sheets.\n9. Incubate at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 5-10 min to solidify the gel.\n10. Remove the droplets from the Parafilm using a fine forceps, put them in a 12-well version of spinning bioreactor containing 2 ml of pre-warmed assembloid medium.\n* Put 5-7 droplets in each well of 12-well plate.\n11.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Current organoid models are limited by their inability to mimic mature organ architecture and associated tissue microenvironments<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, we create multi-layered normal bladder assembloids and tumour assembloids by reconstituting tissue stem cell/tumour cell-derived organoids with multiple stromal components to represent an organized tissue architecture and functionality of adult bladder, and to mimic <em>in vivo</em> pathophysiological features of patient-derived urothelial carcinoma, respectively. Our assembloid model will facilitate development of an innovative model system for studying tissue regeneration and tumourigenesis at molecular and cellular levels, and also provide a unique experimental tool for establishing novel personalized therapeutic options, such as new drug screening strategies that are customized for different stages and types of cancer in individual patients.</p>",
