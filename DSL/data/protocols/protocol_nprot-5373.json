            "content": "In the past, in vitro binding models of TFs were defined based on low-throughput techniques and thus had limited resolution and accuracy. With technological developments, the ability to measure and predict binding sites has improved. A large leap came in form of B1H assay<sup>1</sup>, PBM<sup>2</sup> and HT-SELEX<sup>3</sup> technologies as these high-throughput assays have produced DNA binding specificity data for hundreds of TFs. Despite these significant technological advances though, all currently available in vitro binding models cover together less than half of the known or predicted TFs<sup>4,5,6,7</sup>. One of the underlying reasons is the laborious and technically complex nature of TF DNA binding analyses because TFs are often difficult to express or exhibit altered DNA binding preferences in an in vitro context. Another complicating factor is the ability of many TFs to bind DNA either in obligate or facultative heterodimer configurations, whose DNA binding properties remain vastly unexplored<sup>8</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe tackled this challenge by developing a novel, semi-automated technology SMiLE-seq that enables the robust identification of DNA binding specificities of TF monomers, homo- and heterodimers. SMiLE-seq exploits the resolving power of a microfluidics-based technology, MITOMI<sup>9</sup>, to perform a rigorous on-chip isolation of interacting TF-DNA complexes in a reagent-effective manner \\(**Figure 1**):\r\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4883/original/compressed_figure1_ONP.jpg?1478899003\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4883/thumbnail/compressed_figure1_ONP.png?1478899003\" > </a> \r\n\n\n**Figure 1. SMiLE-seq set-up.** **A.** _SMiLE-seq set-up. Each SMiLE-seq device consists of a PDMS chip \\(approximately 2 x 5 cm) bonded to a plasma-activated glass slide. The SMiLE-seq device is placed on the microscope table and is connected to the microcontroller-based control unit. The microscope camera, connected to an external display, enables chip observation during a SMiLE-seq experiment._ **B.** _Schematic design of a SMiLE-seq microchip. Blue and green colors denote flow and control layers respectively. Each unit of the device is connected to the collector unit on one side and the capillary pump on the other11. All units of the device are connected together by the continuous flow channel with four inlets \\(F1-F4) and three outlets \\(F5-F7). Switching between these two access modes can be done through the use of control micro valves \\(C1-C11)._\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nEach SMiLE-seq experiment starts with the in vitro expression of TFs of interest and generation of target DNA libraries. The expressed TFs are then mixed with DNA libraries and loaded onto the microfluidic chip through passive capillary-based pumping. The antibody-captured immobilized TF-DNA complexes are then trapped on-chip with the deflectable valves \\(paralleling the workflow in <sup>9</sup>) and the unbound material is removed through a washing step. The protein-DNA complexes are then disrupted by Proteinase K treatment and the bound DNA is collected by flashing PBS through the chip. Recovered DNA is then amplified and sequenced. The resulting read data is processed by a dedicated HMM-based motif discovery pipeline that is used to de novo identify the binding preferences of the tested TFs. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe advantages of SMiLE-seq include its ability to cover a wide affinity range, in contrast to HT-SELEX, which is more biased towards strong affinity binders. This difference is explained by the distinct experimental procedures of both assays to isolate and recover bound DNA. Specifically, SMiLE-seq does not use difficult-to-calibrate, salt-heavy washing buffers to purify molecular complexes. These buffers are used to disrupt non-specific interactions, but in practice, they tend to bias against medium- and low-affinity binders, while being not entirely effective in eliminating non-specifically bound DNA molecules<sup>3</sup>. Another advantage is that SMiLE-seq is not limited by the length of DNA baits, which is a drawback of the PBM assay<sup>2</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nUsing SMiLE-seq, we were able to derive novel TF motifs and to refine DNA binding models for TF monomers and dimers belonging to different structural families. Importantly, we also demonstrated that SMiLE-seq can be used to study the DNA binding specificities of full-length TFs that have so far resisted a comprehensive DNA binding characterization."

Define the initial parameters:\r\n\n\n\u2022 Use a MEME-derived seed in IUPAC format. Modify the seed by adding 1 extra 'N' on each side to allow for a more flexible motif search using the HMM-based program \\(see optimization steps).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Set the read length in bp corresponding to the length of the randomized region. For the presented scenario, this value is 30bp.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Set the background probability of each nucleotide. This value depends on the library and is measured in step 5.2.2.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Set the number of sequences to sample randomly to train the HMM. In our case, we used 10'000 or 25'000 sequences.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Set the number of Baum-Welch iterations to train the HMM. Default is 20.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Set the prior probability for a sequence to contain a binding site. This influences the initial state of the HMM. High values allow more \"stringent training\", i.e. to get a more information rich matrix. Use 0.5 as a default value.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5.2.2. Filter and randomly shuffle the input fasta file to remove:\r\n\n\n\u2022 'N' containing sequences \r\n\n\n\u2022 sequences that are larger than the expected read length\r\n\n\n\u2022 multiple instance of a sequence  \r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nCommand:\r\n\n\nfa2filtered.pl < read_length > <  < fasta_file > | filtered2unique.pl > < filtered_fasta_file >\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nwhere:\r\n\n\n < read_length >  defines the read length in bp.

The core of SMiLE-seq is a cross talk-devoid microfluidic platform that performs selection of DNA that is specifically bound to TFs from a pool of randomized DNA. Coupled to high-throughput sequencing, this platform allows the characterization of TF DNA binding preferences at an unprecedented resolution in just a single day. Unlike other, already established\u00a0in vitro technologies that also aim to determine TF binding specificities, SMiLE-seq operates at micro scale and requires minute amounts of biological material. Moreover, it produces specificity models that characterize even low-affinity and transient molecular interactions and that have equal to superior predictive power than previously reported motifs. Finally, SMiLE-seq enables motif detection for monomers, homodimers, as well as heterodimers. SMiLE-seq should therefore prove highly valuable in deriving unbiased quantitative specificity models for single and dimeric, full-length TFs.",
