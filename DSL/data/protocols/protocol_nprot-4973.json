            "content": "In recent years, geometry and architecture of materials fabricated at the nano- and micron-scales, with regular shape and capacitive property, have fascinated researchers in physics as well in the field of proteomics science. Nano-rods, nano-wires, nano-particles and nano-cage shaped materials are only some of the structures with such properties to be able to confine liquids with peculiar physical characteristics<sup>1-4</sup>. Scaffolds, such as anodic porous alumina arrays, have the advantage to be inert _versus_ animal cells and human tissues. As such, APA enables researchers to nanobiostructure a porous alumina-based matrix for developing a biomolecular \\(gene/protein) microarray<sup>5,6</sup>.  Developed for the first time by Masuda and Fukuda during the year 1995, anodic porous alumina was obtained following an electrolytic route with two parallel electrodes, divided in two synthetic steps by using a 0.3 M oxalic acid solution as electrolyte<sup>5</sup>. APA surface is characterized by a high number of pores in the range cm<sup>2</sup> up to 108/cm<sup>2</sup> and has a cavity with remarkable order and hexagonal pores . Several physical and chemical parameters are involved in the control of APA growth, for instance by adapting electrolyte, voltage, current density, electrode distance. APA structural variability can be indeed modulated and finely tuned obtaining pore diameters ranging from 50 to 500 nm <sup>8</sup>. The parametric control of pore dimensions shows an important effect on the size modulation and due to this reason of easy reproducibility, it has suggested the possibility to confine and to spot biological fragments of complexes such as Cy3-DNA and enzymes<sup>9</sup>. On the base of these consolidated results previously achieved by our laboratory, it remains to further improve the funzionalization of APA structure in interacting with proteins<sup>10</sup>. At the moment, only few strategies can be easily followed in order to obtain funzionalized anodic porous alumina<sup>11</sup>. Due to amorphous state and refractive properties, APA behaves like a transparent scaffold with advantages for the following spectroscopy and interferometric steps. As such, it enables researchers to study cell-free expression as an \u201cincubator\u201d in conjunction to NAPPA technique<sup>12</sup>. Nucleic acid programmable protein array is a procedural way not linked to the cell life condition \\(being cell-free), which overcomes common and expensive limitations with a high purification grade, acceptable number of false positive and short time of expression. NAPPA offers brief time and real time gene expression. Proteins arrays show an easy cell-free approach, which expression time reduced to about eight hours. Antibody arrays find application to measure the abundance of targeted proteins, or as a substrate for other possible biochemical reactions<sup>13</sup>.\r\n\n\nFurthermore, in an APA matrix we can confine human antibody or protein<sup>14</sup>. For this reason, we have conjugated the anisotropic properties of APA here used not only as scaffold but also to support the superimposed fluorescence signals from spot samples to reduce constructive interference emission between two fluorescence samples, during the phase of characterization. In recent years the confinement of cDNA gene fragments of oligonucleotides in anodic porous alumina was reported<sup>15</sup>. Biological sample confinements open the prospective to funzionalize the APA matrix to anchor proteins with a system of three molecules. We can summarize our activity in three steps: first- step is to produce anodic porous alumina; second step of gene expression onto the APA surface is the phase of the samples characterization. by using first-, second- antibody directed to the domain region of protein expressed onto the APA surface. For gene expression, we have used the Promega kit in which is contained a TNT coupled reticulocyte Lysate System. High-density functional proteomic array was obtained and the expression of gene \\(example: Jun) onto the APA surface is here presented. Common mono-use platform for an array in use is made up of nylon and glass. Slides are commonly funzionalized to anchor antibody or plasmids. Instead, the surface of glass or nylon slides for the deposition of protein is commonly functionalized by chemical or biological treatment<sup>16</sup>. The purpose of this research is to show an active role in the expression of plasmids on the surface of anodic porous alumina with a proven resistance<sup>17</sup>. Phenomena of capillarity should be avoided during the filling of pores<sup>18</sup>. For this reason shape and pores dimension play a major role in avoiding leaking/confinment of liquids. As such, we should spot DNA plasmids onto the APA surface together with antibodies, in order to study the expression of proteins from genes and their interaction with alumina, without altering the pore structure. Nanoarrays resulting from LB nanotemplate and piezoelectric inkjet printing of SNAP Genes utilizing E.Coli cell free expression system open the solution of problems in structural<sup>19</sup> and functional<sup>13</sup> proteomics for Cancer control."

            "header": "Anticipated Results",
            "content": "The results obtained \\(Figs. 1-6) report primarily the matrix characterization of anodic porous alumina obtained from an electrolytic process with topographical images of the surface, during the phase of validation with atomic force microscopy  in contact mode by using a SNC18 tip, which are in according with the results introduced by CCD camera images coupled with microscopy. An APA image reported  of the sample layers was acquired by using CCD camera before the robot printing procedure with and afterward were put in comparison with Fig.1 b) were is clearly visible a circular shape on the surface. We consider that this grey circular shape zone, depend from an altered refractivity behaviour of the light on the APA surface without treatment and with sample spots. Images from only APA and with a circular spot are reported , don\u2019t show altered or damage effects on the surface. The fluorescence signals acquired from the slide samples depends from the concentration of Cy3 fruorophore in solution, formation of dimers and trimmers, proteins conformation on the APA surface .17 In particular, if the protein has a good degree of hydration and an optimal conformation in this environment, a large number of domains are exposed to primary antibody, second, and to Cy3. This can have an influence on the fluorescence signal yields. Furthermore, we know from our experiments that the fluorescence signals from APA surface treated with Cy3 must be attributed to the complex linkage protein-antibody 1-antibody 2 and with Cy3 and not from native fluorescence of APA or from fluorophore deposited on the surface of APA.18 Namely, the Cy3 fluorochrome unlinked to the complex was completely washed out from both holes and pore walls, give no fluorescence after three forced subsequent rinsing steps with Milli-Q water. The effects of a phosphate buffer, which were received in the expression kit and were preliminarily tested on APA, were as follows: the CCD images showed that the APA architecture order is not affected by this treatment. After the treatment with a solution of fluorochrome Cy3, Axio Vision 3.0 software in live modality was used to acquire fluorescence images after a frame step of 40 ms, the characterization phase was monitoring for 6 min. A modality of signals attenuation is activated but fluorophore concentration is included in a range to avoid effect of saturation. Circular spots with irregular shapes were detected on the APA surface and are reported in Fig. 3 a). A magnification of a single spot is reported in Fig. 3 b). Traces of robot pens extremity are clearly shown in the concentric distribution \\(in particular in the right spot) and by the radii crossing the spots; correspondingly, the fluorescence signal of the protein expression is lower in these regions. The fluorescence signals intensity is different into the domino of the circular spot. \r\n\n\nWe addressed these behaviours to free arrangement of proteins in the growing process and their 3D folding, which influenced the full fill of pore structure as well as the geometry of the genes deposition by the robot. Furthermore, the spot enlarged c observed close to the left spot. Conventional NAPPA on flat surfaces showed neither these side structures nor the fingerprint of the robot pen tip. At present, these findings in material as porous as APA point out the potential effects in the hydro-dynamical conditions between the solution drop from the robot pen and the hydrophobic nature of the APA surface.19 In a flat surface, the solution deposited by the pen tip attains homogeneous distribution before water evaporation, cancelling the tip shape memory. In APA, the diffusion trend is prevented by pores, which confine the solution content within pore. The fluorescence is present only in the zone of circular spot. This confirmed that the cy3 treatment interest only circular spot and is complete removed after rising of slides.\r\n\n\nIn the application of  bacterial PURExpress \\(Figure 7) to NAPPA a template double-stranded DNA containing the gene of interest is fused to a SNAP tag and to an upstream T7 promoter when immobilized in APA pores. By adding the PURExpress reconstituted cell-free translation system, the template DNA will be transcribed into mRNA, and then translated into a fusion protein containing the N-terminal SNAP tag and the C-terminal target protein. In the same APA pore, the SNAP tag allows the synthesized protein to bind to its own template DNA via the BG linkage, thus immobilized the target protein.  The immobilized target protein is allowed to interact with a mixture of query proteins and after  the binding reaction, the unbound proteins are washed away and the target protein complex is released by cleaving the template DNA. For nanocrystallography, adding a small amount of the DNA endunuclease will cleave the template DNA and release the fusion protein. Alternatively, a site-specific protease can also be used to cleave between the SNAP tag and target protein, releasing the untagged target protein to form nanocrystal by in situ interaction. \r\n\n\nAPA SNAP microarray coupled with LB nanotemplate and cell free expression system \\(Figure 8)<sup>19,20</sup> is being used as a platform for structural and functional proteomics, where proteins are being expressed by the Pure-Express cell-free system produced by New England Biolab."

APA, characterized by a highly ordered hexagonal pores arrangement, can be, indeed, used and exploited as a resistant mechanical support/scaffold for biological procedures and manipolations such as gene/protein expression. The present protocol was formulated starting from an amorphous aluminium microstructure surface and represents the successful conjunction and coupling of three technologies:1) APA obtained via aluminium anodization and electrochemical route, 2) label-free Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Arrays \\(NAPPA), 3) LB nanotemplate and piezoelectric inkjet printing of SNAP Genes utilizing bacterial cell free expression system, capable to make unique nanoarrays contributing to the solution of the numerous problems open in structural and functional proteomics for Cancer control.",
