            "content": "<p><strong>Development and applications of the protocol</strong></p><p>Organ transplantation is a lifesaving treatment for patients with end-stage organ failure. Mouse kidney transplantation models have been widely used as an important investigational approach to study rejection<sup>1, 2</sup>. Since the first mouse kidney transplantation experimental model was established in 1973<sup>3</sup>, the techniques have been refined and new techniques were developed to improve the survival rate of recipients<sup>4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14</sup>. In our lab, we continued to improve and utilize this model to study innate and adaptive mechanisms of rejection<sup>15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</sup>. In the past three decades, significant advances have been made in prevention of acute graft rejection and improving early graft survival. However, chronic graft rejection remains a major obstacle to long-term allograft survival<sup>21</sup>. It is therefore necessary to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic rejection. </p><p>\tGraft rejection is caused by host immune response to non-self<sup>22, 23</sup>. This response includes a circulating systemic compartment and a resident non circulating one. The resident compartment is maintained locally within the graft and most likely contributes to chronic rejection. The recently identified subset of non-circulating, tissue-resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) represents one important form of local immune responders within the grafts<sup>24</sup>. Another important contributor to the pathogenesis of chronic rejection is the formation of tertiary lymphoid organs (TLO) within the graft. TLOs represent important local immune response sites<sup>25, 26</sup>. The functions of T<sub>RM</sub> in graft rejection are not known. The mechanism of TLO formation in the graft is also not clear. The inability to distinguish resident from host circulating systemic responses after transplantation remains an obstacle to studying local immune responses. Re-transplantation of a graft to a congenically disparate secondary recipient offers the ability to discern and specifically study the resident compartment of the primary recipient\u2019s immune response.</p><p>\tRe-transplantation of mouse heart allograft has been developed in our lab<sup>27</sup> and by other investigators<sup>28</sup>. However, without treatment, heterotopic heart allografts are acutely rejected and are not life supporting<sup>1</sup> thus minimizing the utility of retransplanting a heart in the study of chronic rejection. Till date, mouse kidney allograft re-transplantation has not been reported primarily due to difficulties in the secondary revascularization of the graft, re-establishment of the urinary tract continuity, and dissecting extensive adhesions during harvesting a transplanted kidney and ureter. We recently successfully established a mouse kidney re-transplantation model to investigate the role of T<sub>RM</sub> in kidney allograft rejection<sup>19</sup>. This detailed stepwise protocol will be of great value to nephrologists, immunologists, transplantation scientists, and microsurgeons interested in studying the local immune response. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overview of the protocol: advantages and limitations</strong></p><p>Re-transplantation of a mouse kidney allograft includes five stages: 1) primary donor graft harvest, 2) back-table preparation of the primary donor graft, 3) primary kidney transplantation, 4) secondary donor graft harvest from a primary recipient, and 5) re-transplantation of the secondary donor graft to a secondary recipient. We provide modifications to previously reported mouse kidney transplantation procedures<sup>5, 6, 8</sup> in Stage 1 and 3 to improve survival. Despite its importance, Stage 2 has never been as well described. Stages 4 and 5 are novel and described in detail in this protocol. </p><p>\tSimilar to most reported protocols, we opted to intra-abdominally position the mouse kidney graft at the recipient\u2019s right flank instead of ectopically implanting it in the neck<sup>29</sup>. Positioning the kidney at the flank is the most physiological and clinically relevant way. The kidney can be positioned at either flank. However, since the recipient\u2019s inferior vena cava (IVC) is closer to the right side, using the right flank will cause less tension at the venous anastomosis site and hence offer a decreased risk of venous stricture and bleeding. Left donor kidneys were preferred owing to the greater length of the left donor renal vein <sup>3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14</sup>. However, the right donor kidneys can also be transplanted<sup>30</sup>. To re-establish arterial blood supply in the primary transplantation procedure, we used end-to-side vascular anastomosis by suturing a segment of donor AO to recipient\u2019s AO. In contrast, the renal vein, a larger caliber vessel compared to the renal artery, was end to side anastomosed to the recipient\u2019s IVC. In the re-transplantation procedures, due to the difficulty in dissecting the renal vessels of a previously transplanted graft, we opted to utilize segments of the secondary donor/primary recipient\u2019s AO and IVC for end-to side vascular anastomosis to secondary recipient\u2019s AO and IVC, respectively. In this protocol, we introduce an interrupted \u201c6-stitch\u201d suturing style for arterial anastomosis. We gained 100% vascular anastomosis success rate (last consecutive 100 operations). </p><p>\tFor ureteric reconstruction, due to the risk of bladder patch necrosis and subsequent urine leak, we preferred to use ureteric implantation with our modified drag-in technique. However, since ureteric implantation and bladder patch techniques have both advantages and disadvantages <sup>31, 32</sup>, surgeons might opt to use either method depending on their experience. Details on how to effectively apply both methods are provided. Recipients underwent bilateral nephrectomy thus rendering the kidney grafts life-supporting after transplantation. This allows surgical success to be assessed immediately after surgery by graft function and recipient\u2019s survival. Kidney function can be monitored by serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen measurement. </p><p>\tTo note, re-transplantation of heart or kidney allografts in rats had been used previously to study the influences of early episodes after transplantation on the long-term graft outcome<sup>33, 34, 35, 36</sup>. However, although technically demanding, mouse kidney re-transplantation provides unique advantages over rat models, or other large animal models, because the mouse gene background is well characterized, the diversity and availability of transgenic mice are greater, and the animals and related research reagents are at a relatively lower price. Furthermore, the rejection of a mouse kidney allograft is slow<sup>37</sup>. This makes mouse kidney allograft re-transplantation a better model to study local immune responses, which need sufficient time to be established after transplantation<sup>19</sup>. The purpose of this protocol is to provide repeatable stepwise procedures for mouse kidney re-transplantation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alternative Methods</strong></p><p>Some microsurgeons adopt techniques that involve anastomosing cuffs of donor AO and IVC, similar to a carrel patch that is applied in clinical kidney transplantation, to the recipient AO and IVC, respectively<sup>3, 38</sup>. Others use a heel-and-toe AO cuff for suture anastomosis<sup>12, 39</sup> and a cuff for non-suture renal vein connection<sup>10</sup>. These techniques are time consuming because the vascular patches/cuffs need to be prepared. Using segments of the donor AO and IVC instead of patches is a quicker<sup>4</sup> and a more widely used method. The donor AO segments can be superior renal<sup>4, 6, 9, 30, 40</sup> or inferior renal<sup>5, 8, 30, 31</sup> based on individual preference and surgical needs. Running sutures is widely adopted for both arterial and venous anastomosis. However, interrupted suturing of the renal artery has a higher success rate<sup>31</sup>.</p><p>\tFor urinary tract reconstruction, four approaches are available: 1) Anastomosing donor bladder patch to a cystectomy on the recipient bladder dome in one-layer <sup>3, 4, 5, 8, 38</sup>, 2) Suturing donor bladder patch to the recipient bladder dome in two-layers with<sup>7</sup> or without <sup>13</sup> anti-reflux bladder seromuscular tunnel (similar to the Lich-Greoir technique), 3) Dragging donor ureter distal end into the recipient bladder<sup>6, 9, 11, 30, 31, 40</sup>, and 4) Pulling the distal part of the ureter including a small bladder patch (2mm\u00c6) into the recipient bladder<sup>14</sup>. Given the small size of a mouse\u2019s ureter, using a donor bladder patch was previously considered as the only practical choice for re-establishment of the ureteric continuity in mouse kidney transplantation<sup>5</sup>. After Han et al. introduced the ureter-dragging-into-bladder technique of ureteric implantation in 1999<sup>6</sup>, a growing number of investigators started to recognize its simplicity, feasibility, and superiority<sup>9, 11, 30, 31, 40</sup>.&nbsp;The latter technique also facilitates kidney re-transplantation<sup>30</sup> as described in this protocol.</p>"

            "header": "Procedure",
            "content": "Primary Donor Surgery \u25cfTIMING\n20-30 min\n1\u2502\nAnesthesia. Place the primary donor in an induction chamber connected to an isoflurane machine. Adjust the isoflurane vaporizer to a maximum of 5% with continuous oxygen flow of 1 L/min. Anesthesia induction is verified by observing a decrease in mouse respiratory rate down to 1 breath per second.\n2\u2502\nSkin preparation. Move the animal out of the induction chamber. Shave the abdominal skin entirely using an electric hair clipper. Alternatively, razor blades, depilatory creams or scissors can be used.\n! CAUTION\nMake sure that the mouse is fully anesthetized to avoid accidental injuries to the limbs due to mouse\u2019s movements. Repeat step 1 if mouse is awake or awakening during skin preparation.\n3\u2502\nSurgical Setup. Drape the surgical table in a sterile fashion. Place the anesthetized mouse on the thermostatic operating table under the surgical microscope. Set the vaporizer at 1-1.5% isoflurane with continuous oxygen flow of 1 L/min for maintaining the mouse under general anesthesia using continuous isoflurane inhalation through a mouse anesthesia mask. Tape all limbs to maintain the animal in the proper operative position on the operating table (\nFig. 1a\n). Swab the abdominal wall with povidone-iodine first and then with 70% ethanol.\n! CAUTION\nMaintaining animal body temperature by using a thermostatic operating table or a heating pad during surgery is very important, especially for the recipients. Hypothermia will decrease the respiratory rate of the animal during surgery, significantly prolong the recovery time, and increase the mortality risk of the recipients after surgery. We highly recommend using a thermostatic operating table with a sufficient cork area. Such a table is better for maintaining temperature, easier positioning, and anchoring the AWR during surgery.\n4\u2502\nMake a midline abdominal incision from the xiphoid process to the pubis. After making the incision, decrease isoflurane to 0.5-1% for maintenance of anesthesia.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nIt is critical to observe the respiration of the mouse during the operation to assess the depth of anesthesia. Adjust the isoflurane vaporizer to maintain a respiratory rate at approximately one breath per second. Deep anesthesia may lead to postoperative coma and death.\n5\u2502\nUsing the AWR to retract the abdominal walls, expose the abdominal cavity. Anchor the retractors as specified in AWR setup section above (\nFig. 1a\n). If the operating table lacks a cork component, corks or styrofoam squares can be attached onto the operating table.\n6\u2502\nMake a sterile surgical wound drape by cutting a diamond hole (2\u00d72 cm) in the middle of a dry nonwoven sponge (4\u00d74 in). Cover the mouse with the drape as to only expose the abdominal surgical field (\nFig. 1a-c\n).\n7\u2502\nWrap the small and large intestines using a warm wet nonwoven sponge (4\u00d72 in) with the assistance of a wet cotton swab and place them on the cranial right side of the abdominal cavity to efficiently expose the left kidney for the subsequent procurement (\nFig. 1a\n).\n8\u2502\nDouble suture ligate the left adrenal artery and vein together and transect\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0between the sutures (\nFig. 2a\n).\n9\u2502\nSuture ligate or cauterize the left gonadal artery and vein. Suture ligate the left lumbar vein merging into the left renal vein (RV) (\nFig. 2b\n). There is no need to ligate the left lumbar vein if it drains into the inferior vena cava (IVC) instead of left RV (\nFig. 3a\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nSpecial attention should be given to protect the ureter\u2019s blood supply. Any damage to the ureter blood supply will increase the risk of ureter necrosis after surgery. The arrow in\nFig. 3b\nshows the ureter accompanying vessels are carefully dissected and protected. To note, we use gonadal as a collective term for the internal spermatic and ovarian vessels in males and females, respectively.\n10\u2502\nDissect the abdominal aorta (AO) using the dumostar tweezers and micro forceps and place one segment of a 6-0 silk tie under the dissected portion of the AO between the levels of origin of left and right renal arteries (\nFig. 2c\n).\n! CAUTION\nDo not damage the lumbar veins draining into the IVC. Alternative AO levels where the silk tie is placed are used when the right renal artery or the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) origins are very close to the left renal artery origin.\u00a0Under such circumstances, the silk tie should be placed above the level of the SMA origin and the ligations of right renal artery and SMA will be performed during the back-table procedures using 10-0 nylon.\n11\u2502\nGently dissect the portion where the left RV drains into the IVC using the dumostar tweezers and micro forceps to separate it from the anterior surface of the AO. Create a space under the left RV that allows the tip of the closed arms of the micro forceps to completely pass beneath it (\nFig. 3c\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThe pre-prepared space guarantees that the RV can be immediately transected once the AO is ligated (\nstep 13\n). This provides earlier graft perfusion and reduces graft ischemia reperfusion (IR) time.\n12\u2502\nPrepare 1 ml 4\u2103 cold 50U/ml heparin saline in 1 ml syringe with 27-gauge needle for graft perfusion.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nTo avoid a potential air embolus, remove air bubbles prior to the infusion.\n13\u2502\nLigate the AO using the silk suture that has already been placed under the AO at step 10 (\nFig. 2c\n). By stretching the scissor blade through the space made in step 11, immediately cut the left RV at the level where it drains into the IVC using the corneal scissors. This will serve as a perfusion outlet (\nFig. 2d\n). Then, immediately start step 14. After cutting the RV, the mouse will bleed out. Cutting the AO in step 17 will further bleed the mouse and accelerate cardiac arrest. At such time, the anesthesia machine can be turned off.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThe right gonadal artery (\nFig. 2i\n) will be cut in most mice while cutting the left RV and will be ligated during the back-table procedures. We do not recommend doing any dissection or ligation to the right gonadal artery branches before cutting the left RV, because it is easier and quicker to perform this during the back-table procedures after the kidney graft is procured and will avoid any injuries to the vessels due to extra dissections at this step.\n14\u2502\nClamp the AO approximately\n1 cm\nunder the origin of the left renal artery. Slightly lift the AO up using the dumostar tweezer. Slowly inject 4 \u2103 of cold heparinized saline solution prepared in step 12 by puncturing the AO just above the clamp site (\nFig. 2e\n). When blood from the donor kidney is flushed out and the kidney turns evenly pale, stop the perfusion. It usually requires 0.5-1 ml of perfusion solution to achieve adequate perfusion of the graft.\n15\u2502\nCut the AO\n5 mm\nbelow the left renal artery origin from the AO using the corneal scissors (\nFig. 2f\n).\n16\u2502\nCut the IVC, connective tissue, and all lumbar arterial branches along the right side of the AO till the level of the silk ligation which has been already performed in step 13.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nMake sure not to cut the lumbar arterial branches (\nFig. 2i\n) too close to the AO. Leave enough length for an easier ligation during the back-table procedures.\n17\u2502\nCut the AO above the ligation which has been already performed in step 13 (\nFig. 2g\n).\n18\u2502\nUse a dry nonwoven sponge (4\u00d72 in) to absorb the blood and perform a right cranial visceral rotation. Better visualization of the AO segment and renal pedicle will be achieved.\n19\u2502\nSeparate the connective tissues between the aortic segment and renal artery from the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity.\n20\u2502\nTransect the left ureter at the distal end (\nFig. 2h\n). Separate it from the surface of the psoas major muscle.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThe ureter transection should be placed as distal as possible so that the ureter length is sufficient for re-transplantation.\n21\u2502\nGently lift the donor kidney\u2019s lower pole and cut the lumbar vein at the distal part of the ligation (\nFig. 2b\n, step 9). Cut the connective tissue around the kidney, between the kidney and the posterior abdominal wall and the adrenal gland.\n22\u2502\nHarvest the kidney graft with its arterial, venous, and ureteral connections intact. Immediately place the organ in a container with 4 \u2103 cold normal saline.\n23\u2502\nEuthanize then discard the primary donor according to institutional guidelines.\nBack-table preparation of the primary kidney graft\n\u25cfTIMING\n3-5 min\n24\u2502\nPrepare an icebox using a tissue culture dish (10\u00d72 cm) containing crushed ice. Put a piece of nonwoven sponge (4\u00d74 in) in the 4 \u2103 cold normal saline. Take the wet cold sponge out and stretch it out on the top of the tissue culture dish lid under the microscope. Take the donor kidney out of the cold saline and put it on the sponge. Examine the ends of AO and RV under 25x power microscope.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nCareful examination of the AO and RV ends is needed to make sure they were evenly cut and hence will form adequate anastomoses.\n25\u2502\nPerfuse the organ through the AO using 0.2-0.5 ml 4 \u2103 cold heparin saline in a 27-gauge syringe to eliminate any residual blood inside the graft and vascular lumens. Ligate the right gonadal artery which originates from the anterior wall of the AO and the lumbar arteries which originate from the right or posterior wall of the AO using 10-0 nylon (\nFig. 2i\n). Ligate the right renal artery or SMA using 10-0 nylon if alternative AO ligating levels as described in step 10 are applied.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nIn our experience, most mice\u2019s right gonadal arteries originate from the AO anterior wall and are more cranial than the draining site of the left renal vein into the IVC. Also, almost 50% of the mice have 1-2 lumbar arteries originating from the right or posterior wall of the AO portion which need to be harvested as a segment attaching to the renal artery. These arterial branches are small and hard to expose for ligation before perfusion (\nFig. 2i\n). We highly recommend that the ligations of these branches are performed during back-table preparation. These branches, if not ligated, will cause severe bleeding after reperfusion in the recipient which can be potentially fatal. We suggest ligating these small branches instead of cauterizing them to avoid thermal injuries to the AO. See\nSupplementary Video 1\nfor additional guidance on back-table preparation of donor graft.\n26\u2502\nMove the donor kidney back into the 4 \u2103 cold normal saline immediately for preservation.\nPrimary Recipient Surgery\n\u25cfTIMING\n50-60 min\n27\u2502\nAnesthesia and laparotomy. Similar to steps 1-6 in primary donor surgery, anesthetize the primary recipient, remove the abdominal hair, prep the skin, make a midline incision, retract the abdominal wall to expose the abdominal cavity, and cover the mouse with a sterile surgical wound drape.\n28\u2502\nWrap the small and large intestines using a warm wet nonwoven sponge (4\u00d72 in) with the assistance of a wet cotton swab and perform a left cranial visceral rotation to efficiently expose the right abdominal cavity and recipient IVC and AO (\nFig. 1b\n).\n29\u2502\nSlightly lift the right ureter using the dumostar tweezers and cut the ureter with a mono-polar fine-tip cautery. Ligate the native right renal artery and vein together using 6-0 silk tie and remove the right native kidney of primary recipient (\nFig. 4a\n).\n30\u2502\nUse 6-0 silk to temporarily ligate the small lumbar arteries and veins that originate from and merge into the AO and IVC respectively to prepare a portion of the AO and IVC for anastomosis. Dissect and remove the fat and connective tissue that adhere to the anterior walls of the AO and IVC.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThere is no need to separate the AO from the IVC. The ideal position for arterial and venous anastomosis is between the origin of left RV and the iliac bifurcation of AO (the anastomosis window). The left or right lumbar veins usually drain into the renal veins. If they drain into the IVC, temporarily ligating them at the IVC may offer better preparation of AO and IVC as ideal anastomosis sites.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nMultiple temporary ligations might be needed to achieve an ideal AO anastomosis window, although usually 1-2 temporary ligations are sufficient. More than 2 temporary ligations are often used when there is a horizontal arterial branch originating from the AO running across the anterior wall of the IVC. In this case, longer portions of AO and IVC need to be prepared for the anastomosis. In addition, the anastomosis site might need to be moved to the upper or lower part of the anastomosis window so that the arterial branches can be avoided. However, if there is no way to avoid them, the branches need to be ligated.\n31\u2502\nPlace the first bull-dog clamp on the distal part of the IVC and AO using the micro forceps and mosquito forceps holding the bulldog (\nFig. 5\n).\n32\u2502\nPlace the second bull-dog clamp on the proximal part of the IVC and AO similar to step\n31\n(\nFig. 5\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThe\ndistance between the two bull-dog clamps should not be less than 5 mm. It is necessary to gently press the IVC anterior wall toward the cranial direction using the micro forceps before finally placing the second bull-dog clamp so that the IVC is not overly dilated. Over dilation of the IVC will affect the operative exposure of the AO. It is also critical to observe the distension of the IVC between the clamps after the second bull-dog clamp is placed. If the distention of the clamped portion of the IVC continues, this represents unclamped venous inflow to the IVC and the temporary ligations placed in step\n30\nshould be examined and adjusted to prevent any blood flow into the clamped part of the IVC. If not prevented, this will severely affect the subsequent anastomosis procedure and can be fatal to the recipient. See\nSupplementary Video 2\nfor additional guidance on placing temporary ligations and bulldog clamps to prepare recipient AO and IVC for anastomosis.\n33\u2502\nMake a stitch at the anterior wall of the AO using the micro forceps holding 10-0 needle and leave the needle on the AO wall. Create an arteriotomy at the anterior wall of the AO by cutting the anterior wall under the bottom of the needle that stays on the AO wall using the vannas spring scissors (\nFig. 5a\n).\n? TROUBLE SHOOTING\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThe recipient aortic arteriotomy should match the lumen size of the graft donor AO. Cutting too much of the anterior wall of the recipient AO will lead to a size mismatch between donor AO lumen and recipient AO arteriotomy. This will also increase the risk of stricture at the arterial anastomosis site and is fatal to the recipient.\n34\u2502\nFlush the AO through the opening at the anterior wall immediately using warm non-heparinized normal saline in 1 ml syringe with 27-gauge needle. Stop flushing when all blood and any clogs are flushed out of the portion of the AO between clamps and the portion turns completely pale. Usually, it requires 0.3-0.5 ml saline to achieve an adequate flush of the AO.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nDo not touch the AO intima with the syringe needle during flushing. Any damage to AO intima will increase the risk of thrombogenesis at the arterial anastomosis site. While flushing, directed cranially, gently and repetitively squeeze the AO anterior wall caudal to the anastomosis site with micro forceps. It is unnecessary to flush caudally.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nUse the non-heparinized normal saline instead of heparinized normal saline to flush the AO before and during the anastomosis procedures to avoid prolonged bleeding at the anastomosis site after releasing the bulldogs.\n35\u2502\nGently place the primary donor kidney on the right flank side of the recipient abdominal cavity. Use the micro forceps to hold the 10-0 needle with nylon and end-to-side anastomose the donor AO at the prepared site of the recipient AO. The anastomosis is established using the \u201c6-stitch\u201d technique using interrupted sutures\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with 10-0 nylon (\nFig. 4b\n). Briefly, make the first stay stitch at 12 o\u2019clock and the second stay stitch at 6 o\u2019clock to fix the donor AO to the opening of the recipient AO (\nFig. 5b\n). Secondly, make the third and fourth stitches at 2 o\u2019clock and 4 o\u2019clock (\nFig. 5c\n). Then, rotate the operating table by 180 degrees and gently flip the kidney graft over to the left side of the recipient abdominal cavity (\nFig. 1c\n). Flush the anastomosis site with normal saline. Make the fifth and sixth stitches at 2 o\u2019clock and 4 o\u2019clock (8 o\u2019clock and 10 o\u2019clock, respectively, before table rotation) to finish the arterial anastomosis (\nFig. 5d\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nMake sure that full thickness passes of the suture needle including the vascular adventitia and the intima are achieved and no posterior AO wall is hooked when suturing the anterior wall of the AO.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nExamine the 10-0 needle prior to suturing the AO wall. Any damage of the tip of the needle will increase the perforating injury to the AO wall and the potential to carry the adventitia into the lumen of the AO. This increases the risk of arterial thrombogenesis at the anastomosis site.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nEmploy interrupted suturing (\u201c6-stitch\u201d method) instead of a continuous running suture for arterial anastomoses, which guarantees arterial potency without stenosis or thrombosis after unclamping the AO. We have found that using more than 6 stitches is unnecessary. See\nSupplementary Video 4\nin re-transplantation for additional guidance on the \u201c6-stitch\u201d technique of arterial anastomosis, which works in both primary transplantation and re-transplantation procedures.\n36\u2502\nAfter finishing the arterial anastomosis, keep the recipient and the kidney graft in the same position for venous anastomosis. Use the Vannas-T\u00fcbingen spring scissors to make a venotomy at the anterior wall of the IVC with the assistance of micro forceps (\nFig. 5e\n).\nThe primary donor renal vein is end-to-side anastomosed to the recipient IVC using a continuous running suture with 10-0 nylon (\nFig. 4c\n).\n? TROUBLE SHOOTING\nFirst, place two stay stitches at 12 o\u2019clock and 6 o\u2019clock, respectively, to fix the primary donor RV end to the anastomosis site of the IVC. Second, finish the anastomosis of posterior wall inside the IVC lumen from 6 o\u2019clock to 12 o\u2019clock and let the needle go out of the lumen at 12 o\u2019clock (\nFig. 5f-g\n). Last, finish the anastomosis of the anterior wall from 12 o\u2019clock to 6 o\u2019clock. Flush the IVC with warm normal saline to expel any air bubbles in the IVC before finishing the last stitch (\nFig. h\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nFlush all air bubbles out of the IVC before finishing the venous anastomosis. Any air bubbles in the IVC will lead to air embolus and may be fatal.\n37\u2502\nGently flip the kidney back to the right flank side of the recipient. Slightly press the arterial anastomosis site with a dry cotton swab and remove the caudal bulldog clamp first and then release the cranial clamp using the mosquito forceps. Keep the swab on the arterial anastomosis site with gentle pressure for 10 seconds to stop the bleeding then slowly remove.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nGelatin sponge can be applied to the anastomosis site for hemostasis.\n38\u2502\nRotate the operating table again by 180 degrees so that the animal caudal end faces the surgeon.\n39\u2502\nRemove all temporary ligations placed in step\n30\n.\n40\u2502\nDouble check the anastomosis sites of the AO and IVC, and the graft pedicle. Obtain hemostasis by using dry cotton swab, gelatin sponge, cautery, or ligation. Few recipients need the above measures and most bleeds can be resolved by applying gentle pressure with swab, or cautery. See\nSupplementary Video 5\nin re-transplantation for additional guidance on venous anastomosis, releasing the bulldogs, achieving hemostasis at the anastomosis site, and removing the temporary ligations, which works in both primary transplantation (RV to IVC, AO to AO) and re-transplantation (IVC to IVC, AO to AO) procedures.\n41\u2502\nSeparate the connective tissues and fats from the distal part of the ureter graft using the dumostar tweezers and Vannas-T\u00fcbingen spring scissors (\nFig. 6a\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nDo not dissect the ureter too much to avoid injuring the ureter\u2019s arterial supply. Examine the ureter under the microscope and make sure the blood\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0vessels are intact. The distal ureteral part that lacks its arterial supply will be transected\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0off later.\n42\u2502\nLigate the end of the ureter graft with 10-0 nylon to let the ureter dilate (\nFig. 6a\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThe dilation of the ureter at this step will help avoid ureter torsion and twisting during the ureter to bladder implantation.\n43\u2502\nPuncture through the recipient bladder from the anterior wall to the posterior wall using the Dumostar tweezers with assistance of Dumont forceps holding the bladder top.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nDo not use the needle to puncture the bladder. Puncturing with a blunt device (tweezers\u2019 tip) offers better healing of the bladder seromuscular layer and decreases the risk of a urine leak.\n44\u2502\nHold the 10-0 nylon ligated at the end of the ureter with the Dumostar tweezers and slowly pull the ureter through the recipient bladder from the posterior wall to the anterior wall (\nFig. 6b\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nDo not grab the ureter directly. Guiding the ureter through the bladder by grabbing the 10-0 nylon pre-ligated at the ureter end will decrease injuries to the ureter. It also provides a chance to re-guide the ureter through or out of the bladder before appropriately fixing the ureter onto the posterior wall of the bladder.\n45\u2502\nMake two stitches using 10-0 nylon to fix the connective tissues that accompany the ureter to the posterior seromuscular wall of the recipient bladder (\nFig. 4d, 6d\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nTwo symmetrically distributed stitches should be made exactly at the same level of the ureter. They should be placed at the edge of the opening in the posterior wall formed by puncturing the bladder with the tweezers (\nFig. 6d\n).\n46\u2502\nPull the ureter out of the anterior side of the recipient bladder using the 10-0 nylon ligature and cut the distal part of the ureter. Gently lift the anterior wall of the bladder and let the end of ureter graft retract spontaneously into the recipient bladder (\nFig. 6c\n).\n? TROUBLE SHOOTING\n47\u2502\nMake a \u201cfigure of eight\u201d stitch to close the hole at the anterior wall of the recipient bladder (\nFig. 4e, 6c\n).\nAn alternative approach to establish the primary donor ureter to primary recipient bladder connection is attaching donor ureter with a donor bladder patch to the recipient bladder dome. When using this technique, the whole donor bladder with posterior urethra and whole left donor ureter should be procured en bloc (\nFig. 7\n).\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nFor the alternative technique, make sure the donor bladder patch is adequately nourished\n(Fig.7a, c and d)\notherwise\n(Fig.7b)\ntechniques described in step 41-46 should be adopted. The donor bladder patch should be trimmed down to an adequate size. A small sized patch\n(Fig.7c-d)\nrisks ureteric obstruction caused by inappropriately suturing the ureteral orifice on the donor patch. Larger patches need more blood supply and inadequate blood supply will cause patch necrosis after surgery. The opening at the recipient bladder dome should also be as small as possible. It can be dilated with micro forceps to the size that matches the donor bladder patch. If the donor bladder patch is too large (and not necrotic), it will likely cause urine retention due to neurogenic bladder, which is fatal. The 9-0 absorbable vicryl sutures are recommended for suturing the donor bladder patch to the recipient bladder dome. In our experience, the technique of suturing donor bladder patch to recipient bladder dome has no apparent advantages when compared with dragging the donor ureter into the recipient bladder as described above, especially when using Balb/c mice as donors. Balb/c donor bladder patch has high risk of necrosis after surgery likely due to insufficient blood supply\n(Fig.7b).\nWe recommend using the ureteric implantation (ureter-drag-in) technique to establish ureter-bladder connection in this model. See\nSupplementary Video 6\nin re-transplantation for additional guidance on the ureteric implantation procedure.\n48\u2502\nDisplace the small and large intestines to the right side of the recipient using a wet cotton swab. Cauterize the recipient left ureter (\nFig. 4f\n). Ligate the recipient left renal artery and vein together using 6-0 silk (\nFig. 4g\n) and remove the native left kidney.\n49\u2502\nRestore the small and large intestines to the recipient abdominal cavity and carefully re-position them using a wet cotton swab.\n50\u2502\nLeave 0.5 ml warm normal saline in the abdominal cavity and remove the wound drape and the retractors.\n51\u2502\nClose the abdominal muscular layer using continuous suturing with 6-0 prolene. Close the abdominal skin layer using continuous suturing with 4-0 vicryl.\nPrimary recipient recovery\u25cfTIMING\n15-20 min\n52\u2502\nDisinfect the surgical wound with 70% ethanol. Administrate antibiotic cefazolin 100 mg/kg in 0.3 ml saline and analgesic buprenex 0.1mg/kg in 0.1 ml saline subcutaneously. Tag the mouse ear for identification and move it into an isolated cage on the heating pad for recovery.\n53\u2502\nObserve the recipient mouse every 5 min until it is fully awake. Recipient mouse recovers within 20 min. Mouse is given\nad libitum\naccess to water and an antibiotic (Trimethoprim 275 ppm, Sulfadiazine 1365 ppm) chow for three weeks after surgery. After three weeks, chow is switched to regular.\nSecondary Donor Surgery\u25cfTIMING\n40-60 min\n54\u2502\nAnesthesia and laparotomy. Anesthetize the primary recipient mouse, clean the abdominal hair, prep the skin, make a midline incision, retract the abdominal wall to expose the abdominal cavity, and cover the mouse with pre-cut wound drape similar to steps 1-6 in primary donor surgery.\n55\u2502\nWrap the small and large intestines and place them on the left side of the mouse to expose the kidney graft (\nFig. 1b\n).\n56\u2502\nUse a fine-tip cautery to dissect the kidney and ureter grafts, the kidney graft\u2019s artery and vein, and the mouse\u2019s bladder, AO and IVC. Separate them from the adherent connective tissues, intestines, and liver tissues. Separate the kidney and ureter from the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity.\n? TROUBLE SHOOTING\n57\u2502\nLigate and transect all lumbar arteries and veins that respectively originate from and drain into the AO and IVC from 1 cm below and 0.5 cm above the graft anastomoses. Skeletonize this portion of AO and IVC together and separate them from the posterior abdominal wall (\nFig. 8a\n). There is no need to separate the IVC from the AO.\n? TROUBLE SHOOTING\n58\u2502\nLigate the AO and IVC together above the level of the graft anastomosis site using 6-0 silk. Make a venotomy on the IVC at the bifurcation level immediately to make an outlet for the perfusion solution. Slightly lift the AO by clamping it above the bifurcation level using dumostar tweezers. Slowly inject 50 U/ml cold 4 \u2103 heparin saline in 1 ml syringe with a 27-gauge needle to perfuse the secondary donor kidney graft. The needle should be inserted slightly below >1 cm where the primary donor kidney is anastomosed but above the AO clamp site (\nFig. 8b-d\n). When the blood from the kidney graft is flushed out and the kidney graft turns evenly pale, stop the infusion. It usually requires 0.5-1 ml of perfusion solution to achieve adequate perfusion of the graft.\n59\u2502\nTransect the AO and IVC together at the level of 0.5 cm below the anastomosis site of the kidney graft using corneal scissors (\nFig.8e\n).\n60\u2502\nTransect the AO and IVC together above the silk ligation performed in step 58 (\nFig. 8f\n).\n61\u2502\nTransect\nthe ureter graft at its entry into the bladder (\nFig. 8g\n). Immediately harvest the kidney graft with connections of whole ureter, renal vein, renal artery, primary donor AO, and skeletonized secondary donor AO and IVC. Put them in 4 \u2103 cold normal saline for preservation.\n62\u2502\nEuthanize the secondary donor according to institutional guidelines.\nSee\nSupplementary Video 3\nfor additional guidance on procuring transplanted kidney graft for re-transplantation.\nSecondary recipient surgery\n\u25cfTIMING\n50-60 min\n63\u2502\nRe-transplant the kidney graft from the secondary donor to the secondary recipient by repeating steps\n27-51\n. In comparison to the primary recipient surgery, the differences in secondary recipient surgery for kidney graft re-transplantation include: 1) Instead of using the primary donor mouse\u2019s AO for anastomosis, the graft renal artery with a segment of the primary donor mouse\u2019s AO and a segment of the primary recipient mouse\u2019s AO is end-to-side anastomosed to the secondary recipient mouse\u2019s AO (\nFig. 9b\n) See\nSupplementary video 4\nfor additional guidance on arterial anastomosis during re-transplantation; 2) Instead of using renal vein for anastomosis, the graft renal vein with a segment of the primary recipient\u2019s IVC is end-to-side anastomosed to the IVC of the secondary recipient mouse (\nFig. 9c\n). See\nSupplementary video 5\nfor additional guidance on venous anastomosis during re-transplantation; 3) In step 45, instead of 2 stitches, a total of 3-4 well-proportioned stitches are needed to fix the ureter graft onto the posterior wall of the secondary recipient mouse\u2019s bladder due to thickening of ureter graft\u2019s wall after primary transplantation (\nFig. 9d, d-2\n). See\nSupplementary video 6\nfor additional guidance on establishing connection and fixation of the ureter graft to the bladder of the secondary recipient during re-transplantation.\n? TROUBLE SHOOTING\nSecondary recipient recovery\u25cfTIMING\n15-20 min\n64\u2502\nSecondary recipient mouse was treated similarly to the primary recipient mouse.\n65\u2502\nSecondary recipient mouse recovers similarly to the primary recipient mouse within 20 min after surgery.\nMicroscope powers\nStep 1-7, 12, 23-24, 26-28, 38, 48-55, 62-65, procedures for animal skin prep, anesthesia induction, abdominal opening, wrapping intestines, restoring intestines, abdominal closure, etc. were performed with the naked eye.\nStep 8-11, 13-22, 29-32, 39-48, 56-61, 63, dissection, vessel ligation, nephrectomy, graft perfusion, ureter connection, etc. were conducted under 16 x magnification.\nStep 25, 33-37, 63, back-table preparation, arterial and venous anastomosis were carried out under 25 x magnification."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Mouse kidney transplantation is widely used to study the immune response to allogeneic grafts. This response includes a circulating systemic compartment and a resident non circulating one. A distinction between these compartments remains an important caveat to the interpretation of the resident or local immune response\u2019s importance and function. Here, we describe re-transplantation as a method to functionally test the resident component of the primary immune response while also studying the secondary recipient\u2019s response. Our detailed, stepwise protocol can be reliably replicated for both the primary and secondary, donor and recipient operations. The techniques in this protocol can be efficiently implemented by an individual proficient in mouse kidney transplantation surgical procedures.</p>",
