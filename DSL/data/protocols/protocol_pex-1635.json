            "content": "<p>Implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) is a high-resource investment which increases healthcare costs and burden in clinical workflow. Meanwhile, efficiency without exposing harm to patient is mandated due to emerging adoption of insurance-based healthcare worldwide. This adoption also warrants more preventive measures in current practice; thus, clinical prediction models have been developed for several health outcomes, including those using either EHRs or machine learning.<sup>1-4</sup> The most of well-known successes were clinical prediction models by machine learning, that used data from medical devices stored in EHRs.<sup>5-7</sup> Medical histories of diagnoses and procedures in EHRs are abundant but not optimally explored compared to other data types, e.g. laboratory tests, medical imaging, and genomic data.<sup>8</sup></p><p>\tRecorded as a diagnosis/procedure code, a condition affects a health state in the future relative to the time interval between that condition and the health state at the time of the prediction. The effect may be improving, devastating, or undifferentiated, but there should be a quantity that differentiates through time; thus, a computer is able to associate such a trend of a condition with health states among individuals. That quantity should also differ among conditions given the same time interval to the time of prediction, and be inferred from the population as a generalized quantity for each individual given the time interval. This is the intuition behind application of the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator in this protocol. It also allows comparable medical history across healthcare providers, since this type of data is often isolated within each healthcare provider. By population-level historical rate, it is possible to utilize the isolated data across healthcare providers without accessing the respective databases.</p><p>\tThis protocol was already applied in a project consisting multiple studies that compared a human-machine learning algorithm with those applying human learning with statistical methods and those applying other machine learning algorithms. Ethical clearance was waived by the Taipei Medical University Joint Institutional Review Board (TMU-JIRB number: N202106025). We aimed to describe data transformation procedure of medical histories from electronic health records (EHRs) to historical rates by Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimation for developing but not limited to a machine learning prediction model.</p>"

            "content": "<p>To conduct this protocol, we used R 4.0.2 programming language (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). The integrated development environment software was RStudio 1.3.959 (RStudio PBC, Boston, MA, USA). We used Bioconductor 3.11 to ensure reproducibility;<sup>9</sup> thus, versions of the included R packages were all in sync according to versions in this Bioconductor version. Since the main context of this protocol was machine learning predictive modeling, we used an R package of caret 6.0.86, particularly for data partition, and we also created an R package medhist 0.1.0 which facilitated most steps of this protocol. Our package is available for download from this repository <a href=\"https://github.com/herdiantrisufriyana\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/herdiantrisufriyana</a>. Details on other R package versions and all of the source codes (vignette) for the data analysis are available in <a href=\"https://github.com/herdiantrisufriyana/hist_rate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/herdiantrisufriyana/hist_rate</a>.</p><p>To reproduce our work, a set of hardware requirements may be needed. We used a single machine. It was equipped by 8 logical processors for the 3.40 GHz central processing unit (CPU) (Core (TM) i7-4770, Intel\u00ae, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and 16 GB RAM. But, one can use a machine with only 4 logical processors and 4 GB RAM, if the sample size is smaller than that of dataset we used in this protocol.</p>"

            "content": "1. Compute time intervals between code or variable encounters and each visit of any subject\nThis step was to quantify medical histories into time intervals. In addition to a single-code variable, we also used variables that assigned multiple codes of diagnosis and procedure. Details of the codes are available in the source codes. We computed the number of days for a code or variable in the latest encounter before the current visit (the time of prediction or\nd\n0\n).\n2. Split a dataset randomly for a derivation and validation set\nWe only used the derivation set to infer KM estimates at the population level. Later, we also used it for training set of a prediction model; thus, our models were blinded to the distribution of KM estimates of any external validation sets.\n3. Calculate KM estimate for each code or variable\nThe KM estimate (equation in Figure 1),\n10\nas we denote it as an estimator of the historical function\nH(d)\n, is a probability or a fraction of visits that a condition is longer than\nd\ndays before\nd\n0\n. This consists of\nd\ni\nas\na day when at least an encounter occurred for a code or variable that refers to that condition,\ne\ni\nis the number of encounters for the code or variable on day\nd\ni\n, and\nv\ni\nis a visit recorded that did not encounter the code or variable (it was censored) up to day\nd\ni\n.\n4. Apply interpolation between time points of historical rates\nBecause there might be a day on which no code or variable is encountered in the population, we applied a linear interpolation between time points at which a KM estimate was able to be calculated. Other methods of interpolation are also available in medhist 0.1.0, an R package, that allows future investigators to implement this historical rate.\n5. Compute provider-wise time intervals\nMedical histories for derivation set were nationwide, while those for training set were provider-wise by estimation. This means our prediction models only used medical histories recorded by a healthcare provider, which was blinded to those recorded by others. This reflects most real-world situations in which a healthcare provider does not have access to medical records of other providers.\n6. Transform a provider-wise time interval into a nationwide KM estimate.\nA KM estimate of a code for an individual was then determined given the number of days from a code or variable encounter to the current visit. The number of days was matched with those in historical rates of each code. We already have nationwide historical (KM) rates for each code or variable, derived from the training set only. All medical histories in days of a subject in each healthcare provider were transformed into historical rates. This technique allowed generalization of individual data based on nationwide, population-level data, without the need to access data from other providers."

By this extraction technique, machine can learn medical history of a condition in each healthcare provider, as a differential quantity through time in term of affecting a future health state, without a need to access EHRs of other healthcare providers. However, this protocol needs a sufficient amount of longitudinal data from the most subjects in EHRs.
