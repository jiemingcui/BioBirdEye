            "content": "Despite increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cellular senescence<sup>1-6</sup>, there has been little progress in identifying small molecules that extend the finite lifespan of normal human cells. To address these challenges, we present a method that allows chemical screening for the modulators of cellular lifespan in a systematic and high-throughput manner<sup>7</sup>. To induce cellular senescence by triggering telomere dysfunction, a dominant-negative form of a telomeric protein TRF2 \\(TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup>)<sup>8</sup> is stably expressed in normal human BJ fibroblasts by retroviral transduction. For facile monitoring of BJ cells stably expressing TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup>, EGFP is coexpressed with TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup> from internal ribosome entry site \\(IRES). TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup>\u2013induced senescent BJ cells are dispensed into 96-well plates and systematically monitored by automated fluorescence microscopy for six days after addition of each compound in a chemical library. In determining the effects of a small molecule, three main parameters of cellular senescence are focused. First, it is examined whether the small molecule confers robust growth capacity on TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup>\u2013induced senescent cells that had ceased proliferation. Second, the sizes of single cells are measured, since cellular senescence is characterized by enlarged and flattened morphological feature<sup>1,2</sup>. Finally, senescence-associated \u03b2\u2013galactosidase \\(SA\u2013\u03b2\u2013gal) activity characteristic of cellular senescence is determined for further validation of senescence-reversal effects."

            "content": "For large-scale screening for small molecules that modulate senescent phenotypes, it is impractical to obtain a large homogeneous population of normal human cells passaged into senescence. Thus, we use an alternative model for cellular aging. It is known that a telomeric protein, TRF2 is essential for telomeric t-loop formation, and that overexpression of a dominant-negative form of the protein \\(TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup>) elicits a senescence response by telomere uncapping and loss of the G-rich strand<sup>8</sup>. To exploit the cellular senescence induced by TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup> for image-based chemical screening, we generate a recombinant retrovirus that produces TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup> together with EGFP from an IRES for facile monitoring of cells stably expressing TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup> \\(**Fig. 1a**). Retroviral overexpression of TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup> in primary human BJ fibroblasts establishes cellular senescence, as determined by the lack of increase in cell number over time, enlarged flattened morphology and expression of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase \\(SA\u2013\u03b2\u2013gal) \\(**Fig. 1b**, **c**).\r\n\n\nTo implement the chemical screening, TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup>\u2013induced senescent BJ cells are dispensed into 96-well optical bottom plates at a low density. After addition of each compound in a chemical library consisting of a large number of small organic molecules, phenotypes of BJ cells are systematically monitored by automated fluorescence microscopy for six days to identify small molecules reversing various aspects of the senescent phenotype, such as growth kinetics, cell morphology and SA\u2013\u03b2\u2013gal activity \\(**Fig. 2a**). In our screen, a small molecule CGK733 conferred robust growth capacity on TRF2<sup>\u0394B\u0394M</sup>-induced senescent BJ cells that had ceased proliferation<sup>7</sup> \\(**Fig. 2b**, **c**). CGK733 also induced marked decrease in the average cell size accompanied by the disappearance of an enlarged and flattened morphological phenotype of senescent cells \\(**Fig. 2b**, **d**). Moreover, SA\u2013\u03b2\u2013gal activity markedly disappeared in CGK733-treated cells \\(**Fig. 2e**). These phenotypic alterations in senescent cells were observed in a wide concentration range of CGK733 \\(**Fig. 2f**).\r\n\n\nConsidering possible dosage-dependent effects of small molecules, it is often encouraged to include multiple dosage points in the primary chemical screening to decrease the rate of false-negative. Because of the relatively long-term incubation \\(for about 6 days) of senescent cells with small molecules in a chemical library, special care should be taken to maintain cells healthy enough to tolerate possible compounding toxic effects of the small molecules and to prevent contamination. The senescence reversal effects of identified bioactive small molecules can be examined for other cell types as well as other senescence model such as replicative senescence<sup>7</sup>. The screening method described in this protocol can be implemented to most currently available automated imaging system. This method may provide an effective means to discover small molecules modulating cellular lifespan, which might be useful for probing physiological aging process<sup>9-11</sup> as well as for various applications such as aging-related diseases, large-scale screening and tissue engineering<sup>2,12,13</sup>.\r\n\n\nFor mechanistic understanding of the identified bioactive small molecule, various methods can be exploited to identify the molecular targets for the small molecule, including affinity chromatography, protein microarray, small molecule microarray, phage display, yeast three-hybrid assay, expression profiling, and parallel analysis of yeast strains with heterologous deletions, and magnetism-based interaction capture \\(MAGIC)<sup>11,14-22</sup>. Based on genome-wide screen based on MAGIC technology, we identified ataxia telangiectasia-mutated \\(ATM) protein as the molecular target of CGK733 \\(ref. 7)."
