Detection Pvalue determination\r\n\n\n A total of 416 probes on chromosome Y were selected. \r\n\n\n A set of p-values, 5e-2, 1e-2, 1e-5, 1e-8, 1e-10, 1e-12, \u2026 1e-30, was used to calculate the call rate of each female subject using the 416 probes. \r\n\n\n A detection p-value was chosen considering ratio of non-0-call-rate subjects, and not too stringent to exclude too many signals.  \r\n\n\nFinally, the intensity values with detection P \u2265 1e-12 were set to missing data.\nFigure 2 450K Pvalue determination\nFigure 3 EPIC Pvalue determination\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1 c) Data QC\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe data quality was checked by using minfi R package.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProbe QC:\r\n\n\nAll the probes located in sex chromosome probes and within 10 bp SNP were removed.\r\n\n\nSex chromosome: 11,648 probes on sex chromosomes \r\n\n\nWithin 10 bp SNP: 36,142 probes within 10 bp SNPs. \r\n\n\nA total of 437,722 probes remained after removing the above probes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSample QC:\r\n\n\nWe determined the proportion of missing data per sample, enabling calculation of the sample call rate, and excluded samples with sample call rate < 98%. We also compared the predicted sex with the self-reported sex.  One sex mismatched sample and three samples with lower call rate than 0.98 were found and excluded in the further analysis.\nFigure 4 sex prediction results\nFigure 5 whole beta value distribution\nFigure 6 sample data quality check\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nR code:\r\n\n\n#############################\r\n\n\nqc <- getQC\\(MSet)\r\n\n\nhead\\(qc)\r\n\n\n#plot QC\r\n\n\nplotQC\\(qc)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n#check sex\r\n\n\nplotSex\\(getSex\\(gRatioSet.quantile, cutoff = -2))\r\n\n\n#############################\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1 d) Intensity data processing and normalization\r\n\n\nBackground correction and within array normalization was conducted with preprocessIllumina function in minfi package.
