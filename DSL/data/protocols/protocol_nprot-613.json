            "content": "_Drosophila melanogaster_ is a widely used model organism in many biological fields, due to its short life cycle, highly tractable genome, ease of handling, and many other features.  Due to its widespread use, there is a great demand for more effective and efficient methods utilizing _Drosophila_.  We have developed a protocol for homogenization of _Drosophila_ whereby 24 samples of up to 300mg of larvae can be easily and inexpensively homogenized using the Bullet Blender<sup>TM</sup> in under 5 minutes for extraction of proteins, nucleic acids, or other analytes.  Importantly, the unique technology utilized enables samples to stay cool during homogenization."

Aspirate the larvae, or remove as much liquid as possible with a pipette.\r\n  3. Place 10-300mg of larvae into microcentrifuge tubes.\r\n  4. Add an equal mass of 0.5mm glass beads to the tube.\r\n  5. Add 2 volumes of buffer for every mass of larvae \\(for example, with 100mg of larvae, use 200ml of buffer).\r\n  6. Close the microcentrifuge tubes and place them into the Bullet Blender\nTM\n.  Run for 3 minutes at speed 8.\r\n  7. Proceed with your downstream application."

If you have the correct ratio and still are not achieving satisfactory homogenization, run your samples for another three minutes at speed 10.  Alternatively, you may try using a denser bead, such as zirconium silicate."
