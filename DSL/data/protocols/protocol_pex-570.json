            "content": "<p>In eukaryotic cells, the genome is spatially organized and its three-dimentional (3D) architecture is vital to the proper execution of its functions<sup>1</sup>. One key feature of the 3D genome is that individual chromosomes are non-randomly positioned with respect to the nuclear periphery<sup>2\u20139</sup>. The nuclear lamina is thought to be the key organizer of the radial arrangement of chromatin in interphase nuclei<sup>10</sup>, by creating a large nuclear compartment where the majority of inactive chromatin clusters in the form of lamina-associated domains (LADs)<sup>11\u201313</sup>. Specialized sub-chromosomal regions, such as centromeres and telomeres, as well as nucleolar organizing regions, are also non-randomly positioned in the nucleus<sup>14\u201318</sup>. The latter contain ribosomal RNA gene clusters that coalesce to form the core of the largest nuclear body, the nucleolus, and organize chromatin in and around them<sup>19</sup>. Furthermore, inter-chromosomal interactions around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles have also been implicated in shaping the 3D genome<sup>20</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferential radial location of certain genomic loci in the nucleus has been variably attributed to gene density<sup>3,5,6</sup>, GC-content<sup>21\u201323</sup>, as well as chromosome size<sup>4,7,8,24</sup>. Additionally, transcriptional activity has also been implicated in radial nuclear organization, although it is still unclear whether transcription influences radiality or <em>vice versa</em><sup>25\u201335</sup>. Overall, the role of genomic and epigenomic features in shaping radiality remains to be quantified, despite several attempts to model the contribution of various factors<sup>35\u201337</sup>. In particular, it is unclear whether the nucleus merely consists of a peripheral transcriptionally inactive compartment as opposed to a central transcriptionally active one, or whether a finer stratification exists. In this context, a major obstacle until now has been the lack of dedicated genome-wide methods to specifically tackle this aspect of chromatin organization at high resolution. To overcome this limitation, here we develop a method that allows inferring radial locations genome-wide, all along the nuclear radius, which we name genomic loci positioning by sequencing or GPSeq. Using GPSeq, we generate the first high-resolution map of radial chromatin organization in human cells, which reveals a clear tendency of individual genomic regions to occupy specific radial locations, as well as gradients of chromatin modifications, transcriptional activity and replication timing, and a marked polar arrangement of chromosomes with respect to A/B compartments and subcompartments<sup>38,39</sup>. We develop a high-performance algorithm, <em>chromflock</em>, that dramatically improves the accuracy of whole-genome structure ensemble generation. Finally, we integrate GPSeq maps with DNA breaks and mutations data, revealing radial differences in DNA damage and mutational processes.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>With the exception of lamina-associated domains, the radial organization of chromatin in mammalian cells remains largely unexplored. Here, we describe genomic loci positioning by sequencing (GPSeq), a genome-wide method for inferring&nbsp;distances to the nuclear lamina all along the nuclear radius that works by gradual enzymatic restriction of chromatin from the nuclear lamina towards the nucleus center, followed by sequencing of the generated cut sites. Using GPSeq, we mapped the radial organization of the human genome at 100 kb resolution, which revealed radial patterns of genomic and epigenomic features, gene expression, as well as A/B subcompartments. By combining radial information with chromosome contact frequencies measured by Hi-C, we substantially improved the accuracy of whole-genome structure modeling. Finally, we charted the radial topography of DNA double-strand breaks, germline variants and cancer mutations, and found that they have distinctive radial arrangements in A/B subcompartments. We conclude that GPSeq can reveal fundamental aspects of genome architecture.</p>",
