            "content": "Preparation\nGeneration of capped ERCC spikes\nTen spike sequences were chosen from the ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix and PCR primers were designed to produce ~500 bp long DNA fragments (Table 1). At the 5\u2019 end, we inserted a T7 class II promoter \u0278 2.5 which creates more homogenous 5\u2019 end transcription promoter sequences. The general PCR forward primer was designed to anneal to the T7 transcription site while the individual reverse primers anneal to the respective ERCC spike sequence.\n1)\tReverse transcribe 1 \u00b5g of ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix with random hexamers using SSIII according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction.\n2)\tTop-up to 50 \u00b5l volume with RNase-free water.\n3)\tPerform PCR with ~10 ng of reverse transcribed ERCC spike mix as template.\n4)\tClean-up PCR reaction using OCC according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction.

This results in a spike master mix with a concentration of 2.5 ng/ul.\nPROCEDURE\nRNA Isolation\nRNA can be isolated from any source of interest. We use either the Quick-RNA Microprep Kit for cells in suspension or the Direct-zol Microprep Kit for tissues and whole larvae according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction.\nCRITICAL:\nTo avoid any contamination with DNA, treat the RNA samples with DNAse. Elute in RNase-free water.\nRNA Preparation\nPreparing the beads for IP\n1.\tWash 25 \u00b5l of Dynabeads ProteinG slurry magnetic beads per sample with IPP buffer and resuspend in at least 300 \u00b5l IPP buffer. (e.g. For 12 samples we used 300 \u00b5l of beads, which after washing were resuspended in 1 ml of IPP buffer.)\n2.\tFor each IP, we use 2.5 \u00b5g of anti-m7G antibody.\n3.\tAdd the antibody to the beads in IPP and incubate at 4\u00baC rotating for at least 1 hour.\n4.\tWash the beads three times with IPP buffer, resuspend in IPP buffer and make aliquots of 150 \u00b5l per sample\nPreparing total RNA for IP\nCapped RNAs within the cell mainly consist of snRNAs and snoRNAs. To avoid losing sequencing power and increase detection sensitivity, we have therefore developed a targeted depletion approach using DNA antisense oligos followed by RNase H treatment. These oligos were designed to bind within the first 40 nt of small abundant capped RNAs. The most abundant sn- and snoRNAs based on a first run without depletion were chosen as targets (Table 2). The thereby resulting 20-40 nt long capped RNA species are then removed through column purification using the RNA Clean and Concentrator Kit.\nrRNA species do not contain a cap and are therefore excluded from the IP. However, due to their abundance, it is possible that a substantial portion of rRNAs can stick to the beads. To reduce the number of reads coming from rRNAs, we implemented a similar approach for rRNA removal as for the abundant RNAs (Table 3). In addition (also possible as a stand alone solution) we treat the RNA sample with Terminator Exonuclease, which degrades RNA species with a single phosphate group at their 5\u2019 end.\nOptional: polyA RNA isolation\nIf the desired RNA species contains a polyA tail, we recommend a polyA RNA isolation prior to performing MAPCap. This is the most effective way to remove unwanted capped and/or abundant RNA species (sn-, sno- and rRNAs). Starting from polyA RNA, you can directly continue from the fragmentation step of the procedure.\nOptional: Adding capped RNA spike-ins\nAdd 0.05% of capped RNA spike master mix to each sample. E.g. for an RNA starting amount of 5 \u00b5g, add 2.5 ng of capped RNA spike master mix.\nAbundant RNA removal\nStarting volume: 26 \u00b5l\n1.\tPrepare a master mix containing 4 \u00b5l of 10x Terminator buffer (from the Terminator Kit), 4 \u00b5l AS-oligo mix against sn/snoRNAs (6 \u00b5M) and 4 \u00b5l AS-oligo mix against rRNAs (4 \u00b5M).\n2.\tAdd 12 \u00b5l of AS-master mix to each sample, incubate the RNA at 70\u00baC for 2 min followed by gradual cooling to 37\u00baC (for this, we changed the temperature of the thermocycler from 70\u00baC to 37\u00baC. This takes around 10 min.)\n3.\tOnce the samples have reached 37\u00baC, add 1 \u00b5l of RNase H (2 U/\u00b5l) and incubate at 37\u00baC for 30 min at 1100 rpm interval shaking (30 s on, 120 s off).\n4.\tIncubate the samples at 70 \u00baC for 5 min, put on ice immediately for at least 1 min, and add 2 \u00b5l of 5\u2019 Terminator Exonuclease (1 U/\u00b5l). Incubate for 60 min at 30 \u00baC at 1100 rpm interval shaking (30 s on, 120 s off).\n5.\tClean-up using the RCC Kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction with slight modifications:\na.\tPrepare an adjusted RNA Binding Buffer as follows: 100 \u00b5l Binding Buffer + 50 \u00b5l EtOH (>95%).\nb.\tElute in 100 \u00b5l TE buffer.\n6.\tTransfer the sample to Micro Snap Cap Tubes (Covaris) for fragmentation.\n7.\tWe used the Covaris E220 Focused Ultrasonicator with the following settings: Duty cycle: 10%, Intensity: 5, Power: 175 W, Cycles/Burst: 200, time: 180s).\nCRITICAL:\nIt is important to obtain RNA of a uniform size of around 200-400 nt in order to achieve ideal conditions for sequencing. We recommend testing the fragmentation in advance with several conditions (Figure 1).\nIP\n1.\tTransfer the sonicated RNA in 100 \u00b5l TE buffer to the 150 \u00b5l aliquots of antibody coupled beads.\n2.\tResuspend the mix and incubate at 4\u00baC for 1-2 hours.\nGeneral remarks regarding washing beads:\n\u25cf\tTo properly remove all liquid from the beads for washing and resuspension in a new solution, we perform a short spin to remove any liquid that has accumulated in the lid of the tube.\n\u25cf\tWe then place the tube on a magnet and wait until the beads are properly bound before removing the solution with a vacuum pump or manual pipetting.\n\u25cf\tAfter the last removal of the washing buffer, we take the tubes from the magnet and perform another quick spin on a table centrifuge before placing the tubes back on the magnet. This allows us to collect the remaining liquid at the bottom of the tube with a 10 \u00b5l pipet.\nGeneral remarks regarding resuspension of beads in a new reaction mix:\n\u25cf\tMost reactions are carried out in 20 \u00b5l volume. It is therefore important to remove all excess volume from the wash step before continuing with the protocol (see general remarks on washing, point 3).\n\u25cf\tWe elute beads by dispensing the 20 \u00b5l from the wall of the tube where the beads were fixed to the side. Repeat this step until all beads are off the wall and gently resuspend until the beads are homogeneously in solution.\nLibrary preparation\n1.\tWash the beads 3 times with IPP buffer. Add at least 500 \u00b5l of IPP buffer and rotate the beads at 4\u00baC for 5 min.\n2.\tPrepare PNK-MES master mix as follows:\n\u25cb\t2x PNK-MES Buffer\t\t10 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tb-Mercaptoethanol (0.1 M)\t1 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tT4 PNK (10 U/\u00b5l)\t\t1 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tRNasin+ (40 U/\u00b5l)\t\t0.5 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tRNase-free water\t\t7.5 \u00b5l\n3.\tResuspend the beads in 20 \u00b5l of PNK-MES master mix.\n4.\tIncubate at 37\u00baC for 30 minutes in a thermocycler with 1100 rpm interval shaking (30 s on / 120 s off).\n5.\tWash the beads 3x with cold IPP buffer.\n6.\tPrepare Ligation master mix as follows:\n\u25cb\t10x T4 Ligase Buffer\t\t2 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tATP (1 mM)\t\t\t2 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tRNase-free water\t\t7.5 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tAdd 6 \u00b5l of PEG-8000 to this solution and mix by flicking the tube and pipetting until the PEG is properly dissolved.\n\u25cb\tT4 RNA Ligase 1 (10 U/\u00b5l)\t1 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tRNasin+ (40 U/\u00b5l)\t\t0.5 \u00b5l\n7.\tResuspend the beads in 19 \u00b5l of Ligation master mix.\n8.\tAdd 1 \u00b5l of s-oligo (10 \u00b5M) to each sample, mix the beads by flicking followed by a quick spin.\nNOTE:\nUse individual s-oligos for each sample. Afterwards, the samples will be pooled for sequencing and computational demultiplexing will be performed based on the s-oligo sample barcode.\nCRITICAL:\nAdjust the s-oligo concentration added to the sample based on the starting amount of RNA used. For 5 ug we use 1 \u00b5l of a 10 \u00b5M solution.\n9.\tIncubate at 25\u00baC for 1 hour in a thermocycler with 1100 rpm interval shaking (30 s on / 120 s off).\n10.\tWash the beads 3x with cold IPP buffer. After 2 washes, resuspend one sample with 900 \u00b5l cold IPP buffer and transfer to every subsequent sample to combine all samples. Transfer to a new Eppendorf tube.\n11.\tPrepare the rSAP master mix as follows:\n\u25cb\tIPP buffer \t\t35 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tRNasin+ (40 U/\u00b5l)\t1 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\trSAP (1 U/\u00b5l)\t\t4 \u00b5l\n12.\tResuspend the beads in 40 \u00b5l of rSAP master mix and incubate at 37\u00baC for 30 min with 1100 rpm interval shaking (30s on / 120 s off).\n13.\tWash beads 3x with IPP buffer.\n14.\tPrepare the ProtK master mix as follows:\n\u25cb\t2x ProtK Buffer\t\t50 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\t10% SDS\t\t\t2 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tProteinase K (20 mg/ml)\t10 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tRNase-free water\t\t38 \u00b5l\n15.\tResuspend the beads in 100 \u00b5l ProtK master mix and incubate at 37\u00baC for 20 min with 1100 rpm interval shaking (30 s on / 120 s off).\n16.\tPlace the tube on the magnet and transfer the supernatant to a new tube. The beads can be discarded at this point.\n17.\tClean up using OCC according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction.\n18.\tElute in 9 \u00b5l of RNase-free water.\n19.\tPrepare Reverse Transcription master mix using the SuperScript III Kit as follows:\n\u25cb\t10x Buffer\t\t2 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tdNTP (10 mM)\t1 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tMgCl2 (25 mM)\t4 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tDTT (0.1 M)\t\t2 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tRNaseOUT (40 U/\u00b5l)\t1 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tSSIII (200 U/\u00b5l)\t1 \u00b5l\n20.\tAdd the 11 \u00b5l Reverse Transcription master mix to the sample and incubate for 10 min at 42\u00baC, 10 min at 50 \u00baC, 10 min at 55 \u00baC and 10 min at 65 \u00baC with 1100 rpm interval shaking (30 s on / 120 s off). Increase the temperature in the thermocycler after 10 minutes while keeping the sample in the cycler.\n21.\tPurify the sample using OCC according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction.\n22.\tElute the sample with 6.5 \u00b5l RNase-free water.\n23.\tPrepare the Circularization master mix as follows:\n\u25cb\t10x Buffer\t\t\t1 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tMnCl2 (50 mM)\t\t0.5 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tBetaine (5 M)\t\t\t2 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tCircLigaseII (100 U/\u00b5l)\t0.5 \u00b5l\n24.\tAdd the 4 \u00b5l of Circulaization master mix and incubate for 1-16 hours at 60 \u00baC. (We usually perform this step overnight in an incubator to avoid condensation on the wall and lid.)\nLibrary amplification\nIn order to perform as few PCR amplification cycles as possible, we recommend performing a qPCR on the circularized DNA template and compare the cycle numbers to a standard library. The standard library is a previously sequenced MAPCap library where the concentration is known. We aim at a library of around 2-4 ng/\u00b5l in 10 \u00b5l final volume after PCR and Ampure beads clean-up. We use 1 \u00b5l of circularized cDNA which is serially diluted 3 times to get different measurements with different concentrations. Typically, MAPCap requires between 14 and 18 cycles of PCR depending on the starting amount used.\n1.\tSet up a PCR reaction:\n\u25cb\t2x NEBNext PCR master mix\t\t20 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tUniversal primer P5 (10 \u00b5M)\t\t1 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tIndex primer P3 (10 \u00b5M)\t\t1 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tCircularized cDNA library\t\t9 \u00b5l\n\u25cb\tRNase-free water\t\t\t9 \u00b5l\n2.\tPCR program: 1. 98 \u00baC for 30 sec, 2. 98 \u00baC for 10 sec, 3. 65 \u00baC for 30 sec, 4. 72 \u00baC for 20 sec, 5. Repeat 2-4 for desired amount of cycles, 6. 72 \u00baC for 5 min, 7. 4 \u00baC forever.\n3.\tClean-up the amplified library with two rounds of Ampure beads at a 1x ratio.\n\u25cb\tEquilibrate Ampure XP beads at room temperature for 30 min and vortex the beads well before use.\n\u25cb\tAdd 40 \u00b5l (1x ratio) of Ampure beads to the library and mix well.\n\u25cb\tIncubate 5 min at room temperature before placing the tube on a magnet.\n\u25cb\tOnce beads are fixed to the magnet and the solution is clear, remove 75 \u00b5l of the liquid. (Caution: Do not disturb the beads.)\n\u25cb\tWash 2x with 200 \u00b5l 80% EtOH without removing the beads from the magnet.\n\u25cb\tDry the beads at room temperature while on the magnetic stand for 5 min (do not over-dry).\n\u25cb\tRemove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the beads in 20 \u00b5l of RNase-free water.\n\u25cb\tReclaim beads on a magnet and collect the sample in a new tube.\n\u25cb\tAdd 20 \u00b5l (1x ratio) of Ampure beads to the library and mix well.\n\u25cb\tIncubate 5 min at room temperature before placing the tube on a magnet.\n\u25cb\tOnce beads are fixed to the magnet and the solution is clear, remove 35 \u00b5l of the liquid.

Resuspend the beads in 13 \u00b5l of RNase-free water. Reclaim beads on a magnet and collect the sample in a new tube.\n4.\tProceed with quantification of the DNA concentration (Qubit DNA HS) and size distribution control using Bioanalyzer/Fragment Analyzer. An example of a final MAPCap library is shown in Figure 2. Libraries should be clean of adapter dimers (peak around 140 bp).\n5.\tFinal libraries can be stored at -20\u00baC.\n6.\tSequence the library following Illumina guidelines (50-75 bp, paired-end, 6 bp index reads)."
