            "content": "Phage display is a method to discover peptide ligands while minimizing and optimizing the structure and function of proteins \\(Hallahan, 2003). The phage is used as a scaffold to display recombinant libraries of peptides and provides a means to recover and amplify the peptides that bind to putative receptor molecules in vivo.  In vivo selection simultaneously provides positive and subtractive screens because organs and tissues such as tumors are spatially separated. Phage DNA can then be sequenced to determine the amino acid sequence of peptides on the capsid that have been recovered from tumors. The T7 phage display system exploits the T7 capsid protein as a scaffold to display peptides on the capsid protein unique to the 10B protein on the surface of the phage.  Gene 10 encoding the capsid protein is cloned with a series of multiple cloning sites at the C-terminus of the 10B protein. The natural translational frame shift site within the capsid gene has been removed so that only a single form of the capsid protein is made.  This results in a total of 415 peptides displayed on the surface of the phage."

Lung tumors developed following tail vein injection of H460 cells.  Liver metastases developed splenic injection of HT22 cells.   \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe phage-displayed peptide library represents 10 million independent clones of phages expressing random nonamer peptides that were displayed on T7 phages as fusion with N-terminus of 10A capsid proteins. There are 415 copies of unique fusion peptide per virion. Briefly, \r\n\n\n1) After treating the tumor-bearing mice were treated, administer phage libraries intracardiac injection at 4 hours following irradiation.  \r\n\n\n2) After 10 minutes of circulation, euthanize the mice and perfuse with 10 ml of PBS into the left ventricle that were recovered from the right atrium. Perfuse with PBS at a rate of 2 ml per minute to remove phages that stayed in circulation but did not bind to blood vessels.  \r\n\n\n3) Sacrifice mice to remove organs and tumors for quantifying plaque-forming units.  \r\n\n\n4) Weigh the organs so that the number of phage can be normalized by weight of the organ. \r\n\n\n5) Disrupt the tissues using a hand-held homogenizer on ice. To avoid cross contamination, clean the homogenizer with bleach and rinse with PBS between homogenization of different organs. \r\n\n\n6) Microcentrifuge the homogenate 5000 rpm and discard the supernatant.  \r\n\n\n7) Resuspend the pellets and wash 5 times with PBS. Amplify the T7 phages bound to tumors \\(which are insoluble in pellets) by adding _E. coli_ BL21 into the washed pellets. \r\n\n\n8) To determine the total phage output per organ, titrate the resuspended cell pellets in bacterial culture in 15 minutes when the phage infection has occurred but the amplification is not yet complete.\r\n\n\n9) Normalize the titers of phages recovered from each tissue with the weight of each tissue. \r\n\n\n10) Amplify the phages recovered from the treated tumors at 37\no\nC with shaking until the culture is lysed \\(in around 2.5 hours). \r\n\n\n11) Centrifuge the cultures 8000 rpm for 15 minutes to have the amplified phages in supernatants. Partially purify the amplified phages by PEG-precipitation and resuspend in PBS for next round of biopanning by repeating these steps. \r\n\n\n12) After six rounds of biopanning, isolate single plaques from soft agar, and amplify gene fragments encoding peptides polymerase chain reaction \\(PCR) following standard protocols. \r\n\n\n13) The PCR primers include an upstream primer \\(5\u2019-AGC GGA CCA GAT TAT CGC TA-3\u2019) and a downstream primer \\(5\u2019- AAC CCT CAA GAC CCG TTT A-3\u2019). Perform the sequencing reaction with one primer and collect sequence data in an ABI 377 sequencer. Deduce the peptide sequences from the decoded DNA information.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Immunohistochemistry \\(IHC)**: \r\n\n\n1) Treat or inject tumor-bearing mice  with 1\u00d710\n9\npfu of HVGGSSV phage or control phage, respectively.  \r\n\n\n2) At 48 hours after administration of phages, remove and fix the tumors. \r\n\n\n3) Stain phages in tumor tissue with anti-T7 phage polyclonal antibodies \\(a gift from Dr. Toshiyuki Mori, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, MD). \r\n\n\n4) Use a secondary IgG-HRP conjugate \\(Sigma, St. Louise, MS) to visualize the primary antibody binding by using DAB \\(3,3'-Diaminobenzidine, Sigma) as substrate for HRP. \r\n\n\n5) Counterstain the tissues with Hematoxylin. In detection of use a complex of streptavidin and biotinylated peptide, anti-streptavidin antibody \\(Sigma) respectively. \r\n\n\n6) Perform TUNEL staining as previously described\n24\n. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Near infrared \\(NIR) imaging**: \r\n\n\n1) Label the PEG-precipitated phages, synthetic HVGGSSV peptide \\(Genemed Synthesis. South San Francisco, CA) or streptavidin \\(Sigma), with amine-reactive Cy7 dye \\(Amersham) by following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \r\n\n\n2) Inject labeled phages or the complex of biotinylated peptide and streptavidin-Cy7 conjugate into the circulation by tail vein or jugular vein catheter in tumor-bearing mice that had been treated with IR and/or TKIs. \r\n\n\n3) Take near infrared images with IVIS imaging system \\(Xenogen Corp., Hopkinton, MA) at various time points after injection. \r\n\n\n4) Measure radiance \\(photons/sec/cm\n2\n) in the region of interest \\(ROI) by using the program provided by the Xenogen. \r\n\n\n5) While correlating peptide binding \\(radiance) to tumor response \\(tumor growth), normalize radiance from peptide within tumors to that of the whole body. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Tumor growth study**: \r\n\n\n1) Implant tumors in hind limbs of mice. \r\n\n\n2) Start treatment when tumor size reached 0.5 cm in diameter. Groups include irradiation \\(IR, 3 Gy), SU11248 \\(40 mg/kg), , combined treatment with IR and SU11248, and untreated control. SU11248 was administrated through intraperitoneal injection. Give all treatments once a day for 5 consecutive days. \r\n\n\n3) Measure tumor size every other day by use of calipers and calculate fold increase in tumor volume \\(compared to the tumor size in the first day of treatment) to show tumor responsiveness to the treatment. Include six animals in each group.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Data analysis and Statistics**: \r\n\n\nAnalyze group comparisonwith student t test. Linear correlation of peptide binding and tumor response to treatment was developed by use of Correlation coefficient of tumor growth and radiance data sets \\(CORREL)."
