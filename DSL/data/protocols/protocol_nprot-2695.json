            "content": "Autism spectrum disorder \\(ASD) consists of impairment in reciprocal social interaction, impairment in verbal and non-verbal communication, and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests \\(1). Numerous behavioral tasks have been developed to assess these three domains in rodents \\(2, 3). In the social interaction test, ASD-related behavioral deficits are reflected by a reduction of exploratory behavior toward a novel conspecific \\(4, 5). In the three-chamber social approach task \\(6), social deficits are reflected by a lowered level of approach toward a cage that contains a novel mouse.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe social interaction test requires manual scoring, and it may be more sensitive for detecting deficient social interaction in some cases. For example, in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex \\(TSC), this test revealed impaired social interaction \\(7, 8), whereas the three-chamber social approach task did not \\(9, 10). Therefore, the social interaction test is recommended for studies of ASD, particularly when social approach is intact in animals that are expected to have an autistic phenotype."

Extremely low levels of active interaction, particularly in wildtype mice.\r\n\n\nA3. Use novel mice that are not heavier than the test mice.

We found a reduction of active interaction in Tsc1+/- and Tsc2+/- mice of both sexes \\(Fig. 1). The effectiveness of a given therapy on reduced social interaction is indicated by recovery of the time engaged in active interaction to control levels \\(8, 14). According to the molecular pathophysiology of the disease \\(i.e., constitutively activated signaling by mammalian target of rapamycin \\[mTOR]), we treated the mice with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Impaired active interaction was reversed by 5 and 10 mg kg-1 rapamycin, whereas wildtype littermates exhibited no changes in active interaction \\(Fig. 2a, b).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBehaviors other than active interaction can be analyzed according to the interests of the researchers. We also observed an increase in rearing behavior in Tsc1+/- and Tsc2+/- mice \\(Fig. 3a). The increase was suppressed to control levels by 5 mg kg-1 rapamycin \\(Fig. 3b)."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Autism-related behavioral deficits in rodents are most often studied with regard to impairment in reciprocal social interaction. The social interaction test is a simple test in which behaviors are video-recorded and analyzed to assess active interaction time in a test mouse with a novel mouse. Using this test, we found a reduction of social interaction in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex, in which the mice exhibited normal approach to a novel conspecific in three-chamber social approach task. These results suggest that the social interaction test is more sensitive than the three-chamber social approach task for detecting social deficits. Moreover, other behaviors can be measured by analyzing the recorded video, such as rearing behavior, which was increased in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex.",
