            "content": "Transcription factor-based reprogramming of various cell types has revolutionized the field of translational medicine. Forced expression of transcription factor cocktails, particularly those important for neuronal cell fate determination in the mouse embryonic development has been recently adopted in fibroblasts and human ES/iPS cells to generate multiple neuronal cell types in a dish<sup>1-5, 10-16</sup>. With protocols ranging from cortical neurons to medium spiny neuron-like cells, with a defined set of factors, one can generate neuronal cell type of choice with improved definition and fidelity. Coupled with genome-editing techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9 system and AAV-mediated homologous recombination, it is now possible to perform functional characterization of genes, disease mutations, and protein reporter studies<sup>5, 7-9</sup>. In addition, patient-specific materials can be directly converted from either fibroblast stage or as iPS cells to carry out disease modeling studies.\r\n\n\nWhile a combination of transcription factors might be necessary to initiate a cascade of transcriptional programs in order to convert these cells into neurons, identifying the minimal number of factors needed for the conversion is essential to better define and easily manipulate the cell types generated in the dish. In a previous report, we have identified that a single transcription factor, Neurogenin-2 \\(Ngn2), is sufficient to generate functional and homogenous population of excitatory neurons from human ES and iPS cells<sup>3</sup>. Within 3 weeks in vitro, these iN cells are purely excitatory and resemble cortical layer 2/3-type neurons in the brain. They display quantitatively reproducible neuronal and synaptic properties independent of the cell line of origin, form mature pre- and post-synaptic specializations, and integrate into pre-existing synaptic networks when transplanted into the mouse brain. In this stepwise protocol, we describe how to generate Ngn2-iN cells from both feeder-free human pluripotent stem cells and feeder-dependent human pluripotent stem cells."

BSL-2/2+ level safety\r\n\n\nprecautions are essential for the following steps.\r\n\n\n1. 16-24 hours prior to transfection, plate ~5.0 x 10^6 HEK293T cells in 13 ml of MEF media on T-75 flasks.\r\n  2. Remove media, replace with 10 ml of fresh MEF media.\r\n  3. For every T-75 flasks of virus produced, prepare 10.8 \u03bcg of lentiviral plasmid \\(e.g. Tet-Ngn2-puro), 8.1 \u03bcg of pMDLg/pRRE, 3.25 \u03bcg of pRSV-rev, and 4.5 \u03bcg of pMD2.G in sterile water, for a total volume 650-\\(65 \u03bcl of 2.5 M CaCl2 volume) \u03bcl.\r\n  4. Add 650 \u03bcL of 2x BBS to the transfection mixture drop by drop while vortexing and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\r\n  5. Lightly mix solution by pipetting up and down and add 1 ml dropwise to each plate of HEK293T cells.\r\n  6. 16-20 hours after transfection, replace media with 13 ml of fresh MEF media. Check EGFP fluorescence of Tet-O-EGFP plate to ensure that the transfection worked properly.\r\n  NOTE: For every batch of lentiviral production include at least one plate transfected with TetO-EGFP. EGFP fluorescence will be visible 10-16 hours after transfection. If less than 60% of cells are EGFP-positive after 16 hours it is likely that lentiviral production will be sub-optimal, and thus transfection should be repeated.\r\n\n\n7. Harvest viral supernatant 24 hours later \\(40-44 hours after transfection), filter through 0.45 \u03bcm cellulose acetate filter, and centrifuge at 50,000 xg for 1.5 h at 4\u00b0C to concentrate the viral particles.\r\n  8. Reconstitute the pellet in 100 \u03bcl MEM \\(to obtain a 100x concentrated virus stock) and store at -80\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Primary Mouse Glia Isolation \\(~10-14 days)** \r\n\n\n1. Anesthetize postnatal day 0 or 1 pups on ice. Remove heads from pups with surgical scissors and place in a 6 cm tissue culture dish. To prepare a significant amount of cells at least 4 pups are required.\r\n  2. Remove mouse heads one at a time and place in a 15-cm dish cover to remove brain from skull. Then put the brain in a 6-cm dish filled with cold HBSS, dissect the cortices from the brain and separate the two hemispheres. Remove the meninges using fine tweezers and place the hemisphere into a 15 ml falcon tube filled with cold HBSS and put the tube on ice.\r\n  3. After collecting all the hemispheres from 2 pups per falcon tube, remove the HBSS and add 5 ml dissociation solution \\(5 ml HBSS, 80 \u03bcl Papain, 5 \u03bcl EDTA \\(0.5 \u03bcM), 5 \u03bcl CaCl2 \\(1 \u03bcM). Filter with a 0.22 \u03bcM filter and place at 37\u00b0C until the solution is clear). Put the tube in the 37\u00b0C incubator for 20 min and shake the tube every 5 min. \\(Optional: include DNase in the dissociation solution to reduce the stickiness of the mix.)\r\n  4. Remove the dissociation solution with caution and wash the tissue twice with MEF media. Caution: the mixture is very sticky and move the solution cautiously to avoid losing the material.\r\n  5. Add 1 ml MEF media and use a pipette to triturate the tissue and add 12 ml MEF Media to plate onto T-75 flask.\r\n  6. Change the media on the next day.\r\n  7. Passage the cells in MEF media at least once \\(P1) before using them for experiments to avoid neuron contamination. Passage until P2 and freeze down in freezing medium if necessary. \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**iN Cell Generation from feeder-free human ES/iPS cells \\(~ 3.5 weeks)** \r\n\n\n1. \\(Day -2) Plate human ES/iPS cells on Matrigel coated 6-well plate one day before infection. Dissociate human ES/iPS cells with Accutase and plate 5 x 10\n4 - 1 x 10\n5 cells/well using mTeSR with Y-compound.\r\n  2. \\(Day -1) On the day of transduction, remove the mTeSR from the culture and add 2 ml mTeSR that contains the lentiviruses \\(rtTA and Ngn2-puro). Titer the lentiviruses by adding various amounts of lentiviruses to the cells to achieve complete infectivity and clean selection. \r\n  3. \\(Day 0) After 16-18 hours, remove the virus-containing media and add N2 media with Doxycycline, BDNF, NT-3, and laminin \\(N2+B/L/N/Dox).\r\n  4. \\(Day 1-2) 24 hours later, change the media with \\(N2+B/L/N/Dox) plus puromycin for 24-48 hours.\r\n  5. \\(Day 3) Plate iN cells together with mouse glial cells matrigel coated coverslip. Dissociate primary mouse glial culture \\(passage 1) from a T-75 flask with Trypsin/EDTA and the cells are enough to be split onto 48 coverslips. Dissociate iN cells with Accutase, adjust the iN cell number to 2-4 x10^5 and mix the cells with mouse glial cells in 0.5 ml B27 medium with Doxycycline, BDNF, NT-3, laminin \\(B27+B/L/N/Dox) plus 2 Ara-C \\(2 \u03bcM) onto one coverslip.\r\n  6. \\(Day 6) Change half of the media using B27+B/L/N/Dox/2Arac. Change every 2-3 days until Day 10.\r\n  7. \\(Day 10) Change half of the media using 2-AraC neuronal growth medium. \r\n  8. \\(Day 13) Add 0.5 ml of 2-AraC neuronal medium without any change. Leave them alone in the incubator for 7 days. \r\n  9. \\(Day 20) Remove 250 \u03bcl of old media and replace with 350 \u03bcl of fresh media \\(2-AraC neuronal growth medium). Change every week until maturity.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**iN Cell Generation from feeder-dependent human ES/iPS cells \\(~ 3.5 weeks)** \r\n\n\n1. \\(Day -1) Plate and infect human ES/iPS cells on Matrigel coated 24-well plate. Per 6-well of iPS cells grown on feeders: wash cells 1x with PBS. Add 0.5 ml of CTK to remove the feeders at 37\u00b0C until feeder cells lift off. Aspirate CTK and wash 2x with PBS. Treat iPS cells with 0.5 ml Accutase briefly and bring it up with 1 ml hES media. Spin cells down at 150g x 5 min. Resuspend cells in 50% hES media/50% mTeSR plus Y-compound, and lentiviruses. Typically 200,000 - 300,000 cells are plated per well of a 24-well plate with 1 uL of viruses \\(rtTA and Ngn2-puro) in 1 ml of mixed media. \r\n  2. \\(Day 0) Dox induction. Remove half of the virus-containing media and add back fresh N2 media with Doxycycline, BDNF, NT-3, and laminin \\(N2+B/L/N/Dox) plus Y-compound. \r\n  3. \\(Day 1-2) Puromycin selection. 24 hours later, change the media completely with \\(N2+B/L/N/Dox) plus puromycin for 24-48 hours.\r\n  4. \\(Day 3) Addition of mouse glia. Wash iN cells 1-2x with PBS. Add mouse glial cells in 1.0 ml  B27 medium with Doxycycline, BDNF, NT-3, laminin \\(B27+B/L/N/Dox) plus 2 Ara-C \\(2\u03bcM) onto one coverslip.\r\n  5. \\(Day 5) Change half of the media using B27+B/L/N/Dox/2Arac. Change every 2-3 days until Day 10.\r\n  6. \\(Day 10) Change half of the media using 2-AraC neuronal growth medium. \r\n  7. \\(Day 13) Add 0.5 ml of 2-AraC neuronal medium without any change. Leave them alone in the incubator for 7 days. \r\n  8. \\(Day 20) Remove 250 uL of old media and replace with 350 uL of new media \\(2-AraC neuronal growth medium). Change every week until maturity."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Induced neuronal \\(iN) cells are versatile tools for modeling neurological disorders and human synapse development, and provide a novel cell-based platform for drug screening and discovery<sup>1-9</sup>. In 2013 Zhang, Y. et al. study, we reported that inducible expression of a single basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Neurogenin-2 \\(Ngn2) in human embryonic stem \\(ES) and induced pluripotent stem \\(iPS) cells generates a homogenous population of excitatory neurons that resemble those of cortical upper layer 2/3 neurons in the brain<sup>3</sup>. Within 3-4 weeks in culture, Ngn2-iN cells display mature molecular, cellular and synaptic properties, which can be readily analyzed using various functional assays. Coupled with genome editing and/or patient iPS cell lines, Ngn2-iN cells provide an excellent experimental system that can harness rapid, reliable, and renewable source of human neurons in a culture dish. Here, we describe a stepwise protocol in generating Ngn2-iN cells from both feeder-free human pluripotent stem cells \\(previously published) and feeder-dependent human pluripotent stem cells \\(unpublished).",
