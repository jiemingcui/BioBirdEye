            "content": "Short tandem repeats \\(STRs) or microsatellites occur in the form of iteration of repeat units from a single base pair \\(bp) to thousands of bp. Mono-, di-, tri- and tetranucleotide repeats are the main types of microsatellites, but repeats of five \\(penta-) or six \\(hexa-) nucleotides are usually classified as microsattelites as well. Dinucleotide repeats dominate, \\(CA)n repeats are most frequent, followed by \\(AT)n, \\(GA)n,  and \\(GC)n, the last type or repeat being rare. Large majority of simple repeats are embedded in non-coding DNA, either in the intergenic sequences or in the introns \\(1), but approximately 17% of human genes contain STRs in their open reading frames \\(2), including promoters \\(3).\r\n\n\nEukaryotic genomes contain a large number of STRs \\(4,5); repetitive sequences are present in low numbers also in prokaryotes \\(6). Microsatellites are among the most variable types of DNA sequence in the genome. Their polymorphism is derived mainly from variability in length. Thus, abundance of microsatellites in combination with their polymorphism and hypervariability, and possibility to amplify them by polymerase chain reaction \\(PCR) allows to use them for the construction of high-density genetic maps and enables the molecular tagging of genes \\(7-12) and a wide use in genetics of susceptibility to diseases, breeding and population studies, gene expression analysis, forensics, diagnostics and pathogen detection and classification, and many other applications.  \r\n\n\nMicrosatellites can be identified from sequence data with the use of computational tools such as SPUTNIK \\(Abajian 1994, http://abajian.net/sputnik/ - original webpage, no longer functional), TRF \\(Tandem Repeats Finder)\\(13), SSRIT \\(Simple Sequence Repeat Identification Tool)\\(14), TROLL \\(Tandem Repeat Occurrence Locator) \\(15), MicroSAtellite \\(MISA, http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/) \\(16), WebSat \\(http://wsmartins.net/websat/) \\(17), GMATo \\(Genome-wide Microsatellite Analyzing Tool)\\(18), and MsDetector \\(19). Flanking DNA sequences may then be analysed for the presence of suitable forward and reverse PCR primers to assay the STR loci. Several computational tools are currently available for the identification of STRs within sequence data as well as for the design of PCR primers suitable for the amplification of specific loci \\(20-22) \\(http://www.ufpel.edu.br/ \\(23)).\r\n\n\nInformation about STR sequences can be obtained also from public databases. Information about human sequences is available in STRBase \\(http://www.cstl.nist.gov/strbase/) \\(24), data about human, mouse, dog, rat and chicken STRs linked with SNP are in SNPSTR database \\(http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~ino/SNPSTRdatabase.html) \\(25). Mouse microsatellites and primers flanking each repeat are listed in Mouse Microsatellite Database of Japan \\(http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/mouse/mmdbj/top.jsp), and in Mouse Genome Informatics \\(http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/).\r\n\n\nWe have optimized analysis of PCR product in agarose electrophoresis using the mix of 4:1 of Methaphore \\(Cambrex) and UltraPure\u2122 \\(Invitrogen) Agarose, respectively. This allowed us to separate PCR products with 6 and more bp length difference. Method was successfully used to map mouse genes controlling susceptibility to Leishmania major \\(26), Trypanosoma brucei brucei \\(27) and Leishmania tropica \\(28). Quality of DNA obtained by NaOH extraction is suitable for typing of majority of markers, and then whole procedure can be performed within one day \\(Figure 1). In case of need of higher DNA quality, extraction can be performed using TRI reagent \\(4 hours) or Proteinase K \\(three days). \r\n\n\nThe present procedure is cheap and quick and it is suitable for test of interval-specific congenic strains, marker-assisted breeding of congenic mouse strains, test of presence of transgenes, knock-out or knock-in alleles in segregating experimental and breeding crosses, and for typing of intraspecific crosses, especially those derived from parents, which differ in limited percentage of their genomes."

Centrifuge the plate to flow down all reagents on the bottom of the wells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3rd step TIMING: ~2 h 45 min  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPerform PCR reaction using the DNA Engine Dyad\u00ae Peltier Thermal Cycler \\(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) or similar device, according to the following scheme: an initial hot start 3 min at 94\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s for denaturing, 55\u00b0C for 60 s for annealing \\(CRITICAL optimal annealing temperature for certain primers might differ), 72\u00b0C for 60 s for elongation, and finally 3 min at 72\u00b0C for final extension. Use heated lid during PCR \\(100\u00b0C). PAUSE POINT PCR product can be stored at -20\u00b0C for years.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Agarose electrophoresis**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1st step TIMING ~2.5 h\r\n\n\n\\(i) Prepare 3% agarose gel in electrophoresis plastic tray \\(CRITICAL optimal gel concentration differ depending to size of PCR products analyzed: larger DNA fragments require a gel with larger pores \\(lower agarose percentage); smaller DNA fragments require a gel with smaller pores \\(higher agarose percentage)). For 3% agarose gel size 23.8 x 7.5 cm boil in microwave oven 3 g Methaphore agarose and 0.75 g UltraPure\u2122 Agarose \\(this agarose is added for better mechanical properties of the gel) in 125 ml of 0.5x TBE buffer until it melts. CRITICAL For good dispersing add agarose to buffer, DO NOT pour buffer on agarose powder; optimal gel size may differ for certain primers. Add 7 \u03bcl of EtBr from the stock solution \\(1 mg/ml).\r\n\n\n\\(ii) After approx. 10 min in room temperature pour gel on tray and insert comb. Let in room temperature for 1 hour. PAUSE POINT Can be stored at 4\u00b0C in plastic bag for approx. one month.\r\n\n\n\\(iii) Put tray into electrophoresis chamber and overlay it with 0.5x TBE buffer. Add 75 \u03bcl of EtBr stock solution \\(1 mg/ml), put approximately two-thirds of EtBr solution near to anode and the rest near to cathode \\(for electrophoresis with approximately 1.5 l of buffer).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2nd step TIMING Depends on product length and product length difference \\(30 min - 3 hours).\r\n\n\n\\(i) Add 1 \u03bcl of loading buffer per 4 \u03bcl of PCR product solution \\(in Sigma REDTaq\u00ae DNA Polymerase 1U/\u03bcl solution is already enough of glycerol as well as dye and loading buffer is not necessary).\r\n\n\n\\(ii) Put 10 \u03bcl of each sample solution to starting well in agarose electrophoresis \\(use multichannel pipette). 3 \u03bcl of standard 50 bp DNA should be loaded in the first well.\r\n\n\n\\(iii) Electrophorese samples at constant voltage 150 V \\(CRITICAL optimal voltage may differ for certain primers), check after approximately 10 min the distance of samples from the start using Bio imaging system \\(Syngene) or similar device. According product size and length difference different time is needed to see the results. Usually for products length up to 100 bp it is 15-30 min, for length 100-200 bp it is 30-60 min and for length over 200 it is 45-120 min. Make photo of your result by Bio imaging system \\(Syngene) or similar device. CRITICAL Make photo immediately after taking gel from electrophoresis apparatus to prevent blurring."

It was successfully used for mapping of genes that control response to parasites Leishmania major \\(26), Trypanosoma brucei brucei \\(27) and Leishmania tropica \\(28). The described method is also suitable for quick test of interval-specific congenic strains, marker-assisted breeding of congenic mouse strains, test of presence of transgenes, and test of presence of knock-out or knock-in alleles in gene targeting technologies. \r\n\n\nWhole procedure \\(DNA extraction, PCR reaction, electrophoresis) takes about 8.5 hours and it is possible to analyze 48 samples. When DNA is extracted in advance and prepared in master plates, the procedure \\(PCR reaction, electrophoresis) can be used to analyze up to 192 samples within five hours. \r\n\n\nOn agarose gel we ideally observe single band for homozygotes and two bands for heterozygotes \\(Figure 2). Described conditions of PCR amplification are suitable for most markers and results are readable even if non-specific bands appear. If non-specific bands overlap expected PCR product, it is necessary to optimize PCR conditions for marker primers \\(Table 3). \r\n\n\nFor product length difference smaller than 6 bp we use same PCR reaction but more sensitive electrophoresis system supplied by company Elchrom Scientific AG \\(http://www.elchrom.com/index.php?id=origins).

DNA preparation by NaOH method or by standard TRI reagent procedure takes about 4 hours. When DNA is prepared in master plates, a single person can test 192 samples in maximally 5 hours. It is suitable for quick test of interval-specific congenic strains, marker-assisted breeding of congenic mouse strains, test of presence of transgenes, knock-out or knock-in alleles in gene targeting technologies in breeding crosses, and for genotyping of intraspecific crosses, especially those derived from parents, which differ in limited percentage of their genomes.",
