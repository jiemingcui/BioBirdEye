            "content": "1. Synchronization\nNote:\nWe describe here the protocol to perform SisterC in budding yeast. As wild type yeast cannot incorporate BrdU, we recommend to use a mutant strain, e.g. YLV11 strain, which expresses the nucleoside transporter hENT and nucleoside kinase DmdNK\n5\n. Although not tested, this protocol can be modified for use in mammalian cell lines and other model systems. The synchronization protocol is listed here is specific for the YLV11 strain. Cells are grown in YP media with 2% galactose and 100\u00b5M Thymidine at 30\u00b0C unless stated otherwise.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start synchronizing cells at an OD 0.15 (1.5-2 million cells/mL)\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let cells double for ~2 hours.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 5\u00b5M alpha factor to synchronize cells in late G1 for approximately 2.5-3 hours until cells form schmoos.\nOptional:\nFor improved BrdU incorporation, 500\u00b5M BrdU can be added to the culture after 2 hours of alpha arrest\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash G1 arrested cells 3 times in warm YP media and release in prewarmed media supplemented with 1mM BrdU\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For mitotic arrested cultures:\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 1% DMSO 15 minutes after alpha release\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After additional 30 min add 10\u00b5g/mL nocodazole 0.8% DMSO (final concentration 2% DMSO) and\narrest cells in mitosis\nc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Harvest mitotic arrested cells approximately 4.5 hours after alpha factor release. Asses\nsynchronization state by bright field microscopy.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For G1 arrested cultures:\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Release culture from alpha arrest for 2 hours. Observe cells by bright field microscopy to make sure\ncells no longer show schmoo formation\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 5\u00b5M alpha factor for 3 additional hours to arrest cells in the subsequent G1\nc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Harvest G1 arrested cells approximately 5 hours after initial alpha release.\nNote\n: Cell cycle state and BrdU incorporation can be assessed qualitatively by flow cytometry of all timepoints during synchronization using anti-BrdU antibody staining. Quantitative measurement of BrdU incorporation efficiency can by done by HPLC detection of genomic DNA isolated from cultures.\n2. Crosslinking of cells\nNote:\nThis crosslinking protocol is specific for budding yeast. Regular Hi-C crosslinking protocols can be used for mammalian cells.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To 100mL culture add 8.8 ml of 37% formaldehyde (3% final) of culture.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leave culture in the shaking incubator for 20 minutes at 30\u00b0C.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 17.6 ml of 2.5 M glycine and leave for an additional 5 minutes at 30\u00b0C in shaker incubator\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pellet the cells by spinning at 1500xg for 3 min at RT.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discard the supernatant and resuspend in 10mL MilliQ\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pellet cells again at 1500xg for 3min, discard supernatant, resuspend in 1mL MilliQ\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pellet cells, discard supernatant, freeze pellet and store at -80\u00b0C.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pellet can be stored at -80\u00b0C for months up to a year.\n3. Cell lysis and chromatin digestion\nNote:\nThis protocol performs SisterC using DpnII digestion, however the protocol can be modified to use alternative restrictions enzymes, such as HindIII. Make sure to use the correct digestion buffer paired to the restriction enzyme of choice and correct volumes where necessary.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash crosslinked cell aliquot in 1 ml of cold spheroplasting buffer\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend in 1ml of spheroplasting buffer, add 5 \u00b5l of beta-Mercaptoethanol and 2 \u00b5l of 100T Zymolyase (5mg/ml).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate at 35\u00b0C for 10 minutes and invert every 2-3 minutes.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 2,500xg at RT.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discard the supernatant and then wash the pellet twice by resuspending it in 500\u03bcl of ice cold 1x NEBuffer 3.1 and then centrifuging the sample for 2 min at 2,500xg.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend the pellet in 360 \u00b5l 1x NEBuffer 3.1.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Optional) Save 18 \u00b5l of lysate for the chromatin integrity control. Add 50 \u03bcl of 1x NEB and 10 \u03bcl of Proteinase K (10 mg/ml). Incubate for 30 minutes at 65\u00b0C. Purify DNA by single phenol-chloroform extraction without ethanol precipitation. Add 1\u03bcl of RNAseA (1 mg/ml) to the aqueous phase and incubate for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Check quality of the sample by running it on 0.8% agarose gel. DNA is expected to run as a single high molecular weight band.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 3.8 \u03bcl of 1% SDS to each Hi-C tube (~380 \u00b5l total). Mix carefully by pipetting up and down (0.01% SDS final).\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate at 65\u00b0C for 5 minutes exactly to open chromatin, place tubes on ice immediately after\n10.\u00a0Add 43 \u03bcl of 10% Triton X-100 to the Hi-C-tube (423 \u00b5l total) to quench the SDS (1% Triton final). Mix gently by pipetting up and down Avoid making bubbles.\nNB! The addition of the following ingredients depends on the enzyme and its concentration.\n11.\u00a0Add 5.5 \u00b5l of 10x NEBuffer 3.1 to the Hi-C tube to compensate for added components (428.5 \u00b5l total before DpnII)\n12.\u00a0Add 400U (8 \u00b5l of 50,000 units/ml) DpnII and 38.5 \u00b5l 1XNEB3.1 to the Hi-C tube (475\u00b5l total), mix gently. Digest the chromatin overnight at 37\u00b0C in a ThermoMixer at 400 rpm.\n4. Marking of DNA ends with biotin-14-dCTP\nNote:\nIf using alternative restriction enzymes, make sure to change biotinylated nucleotide if necessary.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate\ntube at\n65\u02daC for 20 mins\nin order to deactivate the endonuclease enzyme.\nNB! This inactivation depends on the enzyme used. Please check enzyme datasheet\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Optional) Take 10 \u00b5l and keep it aside to assess the digestion on gel. Add up to 50 \u03bcl of appropriate 1x NEB and 10 \u03bcl of Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) to the digestions control. Incubate for 30 minutes at 65\u00b0C. Purify DNA by single phenol-chloroform extraction without ethanol precipitation. Add 1\u03bcl of RNAseA (1 mg/ml) to the aqueous phase and incubate for 15 min at 37\u00b0C.

The cycle number should be chosen so that the PCR amplification is in the linear range and the expected size distribution is preserved (over cycling will shift the size distribution of the library towards higher molecular weight products).\u00a0The number of PCR reactions should be calculated to produce the amount of DNA desired for sequencing (usually 50-100 ng).\u00a0It is always better to reduce the number of PCR cycles while increasing the number of PCR reactions. The optimal amount is usually 1-2 cycles below the lowest amount visible on gel. Make sure to use the same number of PCR cycles between the SisterC sample and Hi-C control originating from the same cells.\n17. Production PCR\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Set up 3x 50 uL PCR reactions per library as follows (using half of the bead bound Hi-C library):\nPCR mix\n1x\nBead-bound Hi-C DNA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3 \u00b5l\nPrimer Mix\u00a0(Illumina TrueSeq DNA LT kit)\t\t\t5 \u00b5l\nmilliQ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20 \u00b5l\nPCR Mix (Illumina TrueSeq DNA LT kit)\t\t\t\t22 \u00b5l\nTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50 \u00b5l\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pool all PCR reactions together\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Separate the streptavidin beads from the supernatant using the MPS. Resuspend the streptavidin beads in 9 uL 1x NEB 2.1 and store for optional further amplification. The beads contain the library template, the supernatant will contain the amplified library for deep sequencing.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To remove primer dimers, purify the amplified library from the supernatant using AMpure XP beads as follows. Allow AMpure XP mixture to come to RT and mix well prior the use. Add 1.1X volumes of AMpure XP mixture (165 uL) to the supernatant (1.1 : 1).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vortex and spin down briefly.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate for 10 min at RT.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place on the MPS for 5 min at RT.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discard supernatant.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash the beads twice with 1 ml of freshly made 70% ethanol\n10.\u00a0Air-dry the beads completely\n11.\u00a0Resuspend the beads in 30 \u00b5l of TLE buffer\n12.\u00a0Incubate the beads for 10 min at RT, tapping the tube every 1-2 min.\n13.\u00a0Collect the beads with the MPS for 5 min\n14.\u00a0Transfer the supernatant, containing the final Hi-C library, to a new tube.\n15.\u00a0Quantify the amount of DNA in the Hi-C library on the 2% agarose gel or fragment analyzer to assess whether there are no longer primers and adapters and quantify library concentration.\n18. Next generation sequencing\nThe samples are now ready for next generation sequencing on Illumina platforms. For best mapping results use 50bp paired end sequencing.\n19. Mapping and downstream analysis\nHi-C and SisterC FASTQ files can be mapped to the appropriate reference genome using the publicly available mapping pipeline distiller (\nhttps://github.com/mirnylab/distiller-nf\n) and downstream analysis tools pairtools (\nhttps://github.com/mirnylab/pairtools\n) and cooltools (\nhttps://github.com/mirnylab/cooltools\n)\n6\n. SisterC interactions are classified as inter- or intra-sister interactions by read orientation. Interactions with read orientations \u2013 \u2013 or + + are classified as intra-sister interactions, whereas reads with orientation \u2013 + and + \u2013 are classified as inter-sister interactions. All interactions at shorter distance than 1500bp should be removed from downstream processing.\nNote:\nG1 SisterC libraries should be depleted of inter-sister interactions. Although full depletion is challenging, a 4 to 5-fold depletion of inter-sister interactions in G1 SisterC libraries indicate a successful depletion of BrdU containing DNA molecules."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Current chromosome conformation capture techniques are not able to distinguish sister chromatids. Here we describe the protocol of SisterC<sup>1</sup>: a novel Hi-C technique that leverages BrdU incorporation and UV/Hoechst-induced single strand breaks to identify interactions along and between sister chromatids. By synchronizing cells, BrdU is incorporated only on the newly replicated strand, which distinguishes the two sister chromatids<sup>2,3</sup>. This is followed by Hi-C<sup>4</sup> of cells that can be arrested in different stages of the cell cycle, e.g. in mitosis. Before final amplification of the Hi-C library, strands containing BrdU are specifically depleted by UV/Hoechst treatment. SisterC libraries are then sequenced using 50bp paired end reads, followed by mapping using standard Hi-C processing tools. Interactions can then be assigned as inter- or intra-sister interactions based on read orientation.</p>",
