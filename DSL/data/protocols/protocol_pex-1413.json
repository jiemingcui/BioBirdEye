            "content": "<p>Developments for the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into pancreatic \u03b2 cells, with the goal of using these cells for cell replacement therapy to cure type I diabetes, are promising <sup>1-9</sup>. However, the application potential of current methodologies remains limited because of several major issues, including moderate rate of efficiency (10%~40% NKX6.1+/INS+), high heterogeneity accompanying with high percentage of unwanted cell types (such as dual-hormonal GCG+/INS+ cells), and highly variable efficiencies depending on the origin of the manipulated cell line. To overcome these issues, we have developed a novel stepwise protocol by creating an efficient method for making pancreatic progenitor 3-D clusters, introducing an extra step to potentiate pancreatic progenitors with a cocktail of 10 chemicals, and identifying new factors or chemicals or their combinations for generating \u03b2 cells from pancreatic progenitors. Using these improvements, we are able to generate ~60%-80% of \u03b2 cells from hPSCs, and these \u03b2 cells can rapidly reverse hyperglycemia in the mouse model of diabetes.&nbsp;</p>"

The resulting cells were re-suspended in mTeSR\u21221 which was supplied with 10\u03bcM Y27632 (Sigma-Aldrich), and seeded on 1:30 diluted Matrigel-coated dishes at a density of ~55,000 cells/cm\n2\n.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next day, the medium was exchanged for mTeSR\u21221 and maintained for one more day prior to differentiation initiation.\nStage 1: Definitive Endoderm (3 days).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After PBS rinse, undifferentiated hESCs (at ~90% confluence) were exposed to differentiation medium as following.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Day1: MS12 medium supplied with, 3 \u00b5M chir99021, and 115 ng/ml Activin-A (ActA);\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Day2: MS12 medium with 0.3 \u00b5M chir99021, and 110 ng/ml ActA;\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Day3: MS12 medium with 100 ng/ml ActA.\nTip: (1) 90% confluence (at the moment for starting differentiation) is important as the cell density too low or too high can greatly reduce the final production of the \u03b2 cells. (2) Some cell line may grow a little slowly, thus increasing the seeding cell quantity or extending the cell growth time will facilitate these cells to reach the appropriate confluence. (3) Handle the cells very gently at this stage as cells are sensitive and are prone to detach from the dish bottom especially at day2 and day3.\nStage 2: Primitive gut tube (3 days):\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After PBS rinse, cells are exposed to MS12 medium with KGF (50ng/ml), B27 (100x), Vitamin C (Vc, 0.25mM) and dorsomorphin (0.75\u00b5M). Cells were fed with fresh medium daily.\nTip: Handle the cells very gently at the beginning of this stage, as cells are prone to detach from the dish bottom.\nStage 3: Posterior foregut (3 days):\n10.\u00a0After PBS rinse, cells are exposed to DMEM with B27 (100x), retinoic acid (RA, 2\u00b5M), Noggin (100ng/ml,), SANT1 (0.25\u00b5M), Vitamin C (Vc, 0.25mM), Pen/Strep (100x) and Glutamax (100x). Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day.\nTip: Note that RA is light sensitive.\nStage 4: Pancreatic progenitor (3-4 days):\n11.\u00a0After PBS rinse, cells are exposed to DMEM with B27 (100x), EGF (100 ng/ml) + Nicotinamide (NICO, 10 mM) + Noggin (100ng/ml) + Vc (0.25mM). Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day.\nV-bottom plate based aggregation:\n12.\u00a0Stage-4 cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated with Accutase for 10-15 min at 37\u00b0C.\n13.\u00a0Dissociated single cells were rinsed twice with DMEM/F12 and spun at 300g for 3 min.\n14.\u00a0The resulting cells were re-suspended in aggregation medium (made of 5a-Medium supplied with 10\u03bcM Y27632).\n15.\u00a0Cell solution with 0.1-0.4 (according to experimental design) million cells was added into each well of V-bottom 96-well plate, followed by a spun at 300g for 3 min.\n16.\u00a0The plate was put into 37\u00b0C incubator for 8-12 hours for cluster formation.\nTip: \u00a0If cells do not settle to the bottom of plate, centrifuge again by 500g for 3min. This step does not affect the cell viability.\nStage 5: Posing pancreatic progenitor for generation of \u03b2 cells (4 days):\n17.\u00a0Pancreatic progenitor clusters assembled in V-bottom 96-well plate were collected and rinsed twice using DF12 medium, and loaded on 6-well air-liquid interface trans-well.\n18.\u00a0About 1.3ml stage-5 medium (which will enhance the propensity of pancreatic progenitor for generation of \u03b2 cells) was added for each well.\n19.\u00a0Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day.\nTip: For transferring the clusters to the air-liquid interface, we use the wide bore 200ul pipette tips.\nStage 6: Endocrine progenitor (6 days).\n20.\u00a0Clusters were rinsed in DF12 and transferred to new trans-well. About 1.3ml Stage-6 medium was added for each well.\n21.\u00a0Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day.\nStage 7: Immature \u03b2 cells (12days):\n22.\u00a0Clusters were rinsed in DF12 and transferred to new trans-well.\n23.\u00a0About 1.3ml Stage-7 medium was added for each well.\n24.\u00a0Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day.\nStage 8: Functional \u03b2 cells (12 days):\n25.\u00a0Clusters were rinsed in DF12 and transferred to a new trans-well.\n26.\u00a0About 1.3ml Stage-8 medium was added for each well.\n27.\u00a0Cells were fed with fresh medium every other day."

            "content": "<p>1. The hPSCs are heterogeneous and show early sign of differentiation. As this issue will greatly affect the final efficiency of \u03b2 cell differentiation, so it must be confirmed before determining whether to proceed or not. If only a few of colonies are differentiated (flattened, enlarged in cell size, or having neurites-like branches), the culture can still be rescued by removing those \u201cbad colonies\u201d using pipette tips before splitting. Repeat this procedure until the whole culture is homogeneous. If too many hPSCs colonies show the propensity of differentiation, start again with a new vial of cells and re-establish the culture.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2. Some hPSC lines may grow a little slowly than others and cannot reach 90% confluence two days after passage (before using for differentiation). Two solutions: (1) Increasing the initial seeding density; (2) Lowering the Activin-A concentrations. Instead of the typical 115-110-100 ng/ml gradient for stage-1, use a gradient of 110-105-95 ng/ml.</p><p><br></p><p>3. The final efficiency of generating \u03b2 cell is not high. There are many possible reasons. (1) The hPSCs are not in high quality. To fix this problem, use a new culture or a new cell line with high quality. (2) The starting point cell confluence (right before stage 1) is not ideal. We typically use ~90% cell confluence to start differentiation. If the confluence is lower than that, the efficiency of NKX6.1+/PDX1+ cells at stage 4 will be low, and the production of \u03b2 cells at the final stage will be greatly reduced. If the starting point cell confluence is too high, cell differentiation at stage 1 may not be complete. The percentage of definitive endoderm cells at stage 1 will be lower than expected, and thus the \u03b2 cell efficiency at the final stage will be lower. (3) Reagent related issues, such as quality issues, preparation issues and storage issues, could cause inconsistent experimental results across different experimental batches. Here are some examples: Activin-A (and possibly other growth factors used in the protocol) from different vendors or produced by different approaches (bacteria or eukaryotic cells) or from different batches may have different potency. Therefore, it is better to order a large batch of Activin-A from a certain vendor, aliquot it after dissolving it, and store it at -80\u00b0C for long-time usage. (4) Taking the cell culture out of the incubator too often or for too long. Avoid taking the culture dish (with cells) out of the incubator too often (for example to check the cell status), as it would negatively affect the final result. Especially, such practice will significantly increase the cell detachment at stage 1. One possible solution is to prepare two culture replicates with one for checking cell status and the other one for the actual experiment.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

After 8-12 hours incubation, each well will form a 3D-cluster. There might be some cells (~1% - 5%) not integrating into the clusters, which will not affect the later stage of cell differentiation.

After the treatment, the clusters will become a little more bright and compact. The percentage of PDX1+/NKX6.1+ cells will be comparable to that of stage 4. Typically less than 3% NEUROD1+ cells (representing endocrine related cells) should be observed. Few cells might detach from the clusters at this stage. </p><p><br></p><p>8. Stage 6, endocrine progenitor. Most NKX6.1+ cells would become NKX6.1+/NEUROD1+ cells. The morphology of the cluster will not change too much.
