            "content": "Here we describe a protocol that can be used to determine whether specific mammalian mRNAs are associated with polyribosomes. In the referenced Nature paper, this method was used to show that Tap/NXF1 mRNA retaining intron 10 is present in polyribosomes. This method can also be used to determine if mRNAs are differentially associated with the translation machinery under varying conditions. A similar protocol was previously utilized in our laboratory to show that Tap/NXT1 and WT1\\(+KTS) proteins promote translation of CTE-containing RNA with retained introns \\(Jin _et al._, 2003, Bor _et al._, 2006). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe protocol consists of a method for the generation of cytoplasmic extracts from mammalian cells \\(in this case, 293T cells) without the disruption of polyribosomes, the separation of ribosomal components and polyribosomes by sucrose gradient centrifugation, the isolation of mRNA from these fractions, and detection of mRNA by Northern blot analysis \\(or alternatively, Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction, RT-PCR)."

            "header": "Procedure",
            "content": "The following procedure is for a monolayer cell culture grown in a 15-cm tissue culture plate. This protocol can also be adapted to cells transfected using a calcium phosphate protocol \\(Graham and van der Eb, 1973, Jin _et al._, 2003, Bor _et al._, 2006).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Growing cells TIMING 1-3 d**\r\n\n\n1| Seed 0.8-1.0 X 10\n7\n293T cells onto each 15-cm culture dish 1-3 days before polysome fractionation. At harvest, the cells should be at no more than 70-80% confluency.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: When cultures approach 100 % confluency, they tend to slow down general protein translation, and polysomes extracted from such cells show a shift from actively translating polysomes to a predominance of monosomes \\(a large 80S peak in the polysome profile). It is therefore important that the number of cells seeded are adjusted as necessary to avoid them reaching stationary phase.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Polyribosome fractionation TIMING 5-6 h**\r\n\n\n2| 48 h post seeding, add cycloheximide \\(100 mg/ml) to 50 \u00b5g/ml final concentration to the growth medium. Incubate at 37\no\nC for 30 min.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: Cycloheximide is an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis and exerts its effect by interfering with peptidyl transferase on the 60S ribosome, thus blocking translational elongation. Addition of cycloheximide \u201cfreezes\u201d the ribosomes on the mRNA, preventing them from completing translation and falling off the RNA during the polysome extraction procedure. However, prolonged exposure to cycloheximide is toxic to the cells and should be avoided.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n3| Transfer plate to rest directly on ice in a box or bucket. Aspirate growth medium, and wash cells with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 50 \u00b5g/ml of cycloheximide. Aspirate the solution, and repeat the wash step.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: Keep cells and solutions on ice as cold temperature will slow down translation elongation and RNase activity.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4| Scrape cells with a cell lifter, and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge in a refrigerated microcentrifuge at 7000 rpm for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5| Add 250 \u00b5l of 2X RSB/RNasin to resuspend cell pellet. Add 250 \u00b5l of polyribosome extraction, and mix quickly.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6| Incubate on ice for 10 min. Spin for 10 sec to pellet nuclei. Transfer 500 \u00b5l of cytoplasmic extract to a new microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 10,000 X g for 10 min at 4\no\nC.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7| While the cytoplasmic extract is centrifuging, prepare gradients in an ultracentrifuge tube by underlaying 5.5 ml of 10% sucrose solution with 5.5 ml of 50% sucrose solution without disturbing the interface. This is done by gently inserting the tip of a blunt end stainless steel needle to the bottom of the tube and slowly releasing the 50% sucrose solution from the syringe to displace the 10% sucrose solution upwards in the tube. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n8| Close the tube with a BioComp cap, and put the capped tubes in the BioComp gradient master \\(Fig 1a). Select the gradient parameter according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and start the run. When the gradient formation is finished, carefully remove the cap, and transfer the tube to an SW41Ti rotor bucket. Carefully layer on top of gradient an additional 500 \u00b5l of 10% sucrose.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: During cap insertion, make sure there are no air bubbles trapped inside the tube, since free-floating bubbles have a deleterious effect on gradient formation. Keep rotor buckets cold throughout the procedure.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n9| When the spin is finished, carefully layer 500 \u00b5l of the cytoplasmic extract \\(prepared as described in step 6) on top of the sucrose gradient.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(Optional) To disrupt polyribosomes in a separate control experiment, add 30 \u00b5l of 250 mM EDTA to 470 \u00b5l of cleared cytoplasmic extract \\(15 mM final concentration), and layer the extract on top of a second gradient \\(Calzone et al., 1998; Johannes and Sarnow, 1998). This concentration of EDTA does not generally disrupt mRNP complexes. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n10| Place the rotor buckets in the SW41Ti rotor, and centrifuge at 36,000 rpm for 2 h at 4\no\nC. When the centrifugation is finished, take off rotor buckets, and keep them in ice until fractions from each tube are collected \\(to minimize potential RNAse activity) .\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n11| Collect approximately 20 550 \u00b5l fractions on ice into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes using the BioComp piston gradient fractionator \\(Fig. 1b) equipped with a UV-M II monitor connected to  the DATAQ DI-154RS data acquisition module. This allows the concomitant measurement of absorbance at 254 nm and converts the analog signal from the UV monitor into a digital format so that it can be viewed and recorded on a PC using WinDaq/100 data acquisition software. \\(see Figure 3 for an example of the UV absorbance profile). Further information about this setup is available from BioComp or the authors. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n12| Add 60 \u00b5l of 10% SDS and 12 \u00b5l of Proteinase K \\(10 mg/ml) to each fraction, mix and incubate for 30 min at 42\no\nC.\r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT: Samples can be stored at \u201380\no\nC.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**RNA isolation and precipitation  TIMING 2-8 h, depending on number of gradients**\r\n\n\n13| Transfer 300 \u00b5l of each Proteinase K-treated fraction to a new microcentrifuge tube, and extract each fraction twice with 300 \u00b5l of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and once with 300 \u00b5l of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Keep tubes on ice.\r\n\n\nCAUTION: Phenol is readily absorbed through the skin and can cause severe burns to the eyes and skin. Chloroform is a skin and eye irritant, and it is a suspected human carcinogen and reproductive hazard. Adding chloroform to phenol enhances the ability of phenol to be absorbed by the skin. Wear gloves at all times. Tips and tubes that have contacted these organic solvents should be disposed of appropriately.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n14| Transfer each supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube. Precipitate RNA from each fraction by the addition of 30 \u00b5l of 3 M sodium acetate \\(pH 5.2) and 825 \u00b5l of 100% ethanol. Mix and store the solution at \u201380\no\nC for 15 min.\r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT: Fractions can be stored at \u201380\no\nC.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n15| Collect RNA by centrifuging at 13000 rpm for 20 min at 4\no\nC. Wash the RNA pellets with1 ml of 75% ethanol. Carefully aspirate supernatant from each tube, leaving the cap open to allow the RNA pellet to dry.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: Do not overdry the RNA pellet, because doing so will make the pellet difficult to resuspend.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(Optional) DNase I treatment and RT-PCR  TIMING 6-8 h\r\n\n\nFor RNA to be analyzed by RT-PCR, resuspend the RNA in 20 \u00b5l of 1X DNase1 buffer and 1 unit of DNase I, and incubate at 37\no\nC for 1 hour. At the end of incubation, add 180 \u00b5l of DEPC water to the sample, and extract with 200 \u00b5l of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol twice and 200 \u00b5l of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol once. Precipitate RNA by adding 20 \u00b5l of 3M sodium acetate \\(pH 5.2) and 550 \u00b5l of 100% ethanol, and store the solution at \u201380\no\nC for 15 min. Collect RNA by Centrifuging at 13000 rpm for 20 min at 4\no\nC. Wash the RNA pellet with 1 ml of 75% ethanol. Carefully aspirate supernatant from tube. Dry the RNA pellet.

Wear gloves at all times.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Formaldehyde gel electrophoresis of RNA from polysome gradient fractions TIMING 5-6 h**\r\n\n\n16| Resuspend the RNA pellet in 4 \u00b5l of DEPC-water, and 15.5 \u00b5l of RS buffer. Incubate samples at 55\no\nC for 10 min, cool on ice, add 2 \u00b5l of 10X RNA loading dye, and load onto a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. Run gel at 120 volts for 3 h with a peristaltic pump that recirculates running buffer between the electrodes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Preparation for transfer  TIMING 3 h**\r\n\n\n17| Turn off power supply for electrophoresis. Soak the gel in 250 ml of autoclaved water for 15 min, changing the water 3 times. This step is carried out in a tray with gentle rocking.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n18| Denature the gel by completely immersing it in 50 mM NaOH for 20 min.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n19| Neutralize the gel in 100 mM Tris-HCl \\(pH 7.0-7.6) for 20 min.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n20| Soak the gel in 10X SSC for 15 min.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n21| Prepare nylon membrane by cutting to the size of the gel, and soak the membrane in 100 ml of 10X SSC.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Transfer  TIMING 16 h**\r\n\n\n22| Set up capillary transfer in the following order \\(Fig 2):\r\n\n\nStack at least 3 inches of cut-to-size paper towels in a Pyrex tray.\r\n\n\nSoak 3 pieces of Whatman paper in 10X SSC for 3 min, and lay them on top of paper towels.\r\n\n\nPlace the nylon membrane on top of the Whatman paper.\r\n\n\nLay gel top-side facing upward, and remove bubbles between gel and membrane.\r\n\n\nSoak 3 pieces of Whatman paper in 10X SSC for 3 min, and lay them on top of the gel.\r\n\n\nAdd 20X SSC to two reservoirs, and place one on each side of the Pyrex tray. Soak a long piece of Whatman paper in 20X SSC for use as a wick. Lay the wick on top of the Whatman paper with ends dipping into the reservoirs.\r\n\n\nPlace a plastic or glass plate on top of the wick. Weigh the whole set-up with 4 plastic bottles, each containing 100 ml of water.\r\n\n\nAllow the RNA to transfer overnight.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: Avoid trapping air bubbles between the filter papers and nylon membrane by rolling a clean plastic pipette across. Any bubbles will lead to uneven or poor transfer. Once it is placed, do not move the membrane as some transfer of RNA may have already taken place. Also, be sure not to allow the wick to collapse and touch the towel stack as this will short out the capillary action and also result in a poor transfer.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Post-transfer processing TIMING 30 min**\r\n\n\n23| At the end of the transfer period, lift the nylon membrane, and rinse it briefly in 10X SSC.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n24| Place the nylon membrane on a piece of Whatman paper with the RNA side facing upwards. Cross-link RNA to the nylon membrane using a UV cross-linker at a setting of 120 mjoules/cm\n2\n.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Blocking and preparation of radioactive probe TIMING 1-4 h**\r\n\n\n25| Put the membrane in a heat-sealable bag.

Purify the radiolabeled probe from unincorporated nucleotide using the NICK column according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Use 1 \u00b5l of probe to determine the counts with a scintillation counter. Calculate the total incorporation of \\[alpha-\n32\nP]dCTP and the specific radioactivity of the probe.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: For a good probe, the specific radioactivity should be around 1 X 10\n9\ncpm/\u00b5g of template.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Hybridization TIMING 16 h**\r\n\n\n27|  Replace the heat-sealable bag with hybridization solution. Denature the probe by placing it in a boiling water bath for 5 min followed by snap cooling on ice. Briefly spin down the probe. Add denatured probe to the bag, and seal it. Continue hybridization overnight at 43\no\nC in a water bath with slow agitation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Post-hybridization washing TIMING 2-3 h**\r\n\n\n28| Remove the nylon membrane from the bag to a Rubbermaid container, and rinse it briefly with 6X SSC/0.1%SDS twice. Using the same solution, wash the membrane three times, 15 min each, at room temperature. Then wash the membrane once at 43\no\nC for 15 min.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n29| Wash the membrane with 0.1X SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature, for 15 min each, two or three times.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n30| Check the background of the membrane using a Geiger Counter. If the background is high, continue the wash with 0.1X SSC/0.1% SDS at 43\no\nC for 15 min.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: The needed stringency of the washes depends on several factors \\(e.g., the size of the probe and G/C content). If the washes are too stringent, the signal might be too low. If the washes are not stringent enough, the background might be too high.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**RNA detection TIMING 1 hour to 1 week, depending on hybrid yield and probe specific activity**\r\n\n\n31| Remove the membrane, and wrap it with plastic wrap. Place it onto a PhosphorImager cassette, and flatten it against a PhosphorImager screen.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n32| Depending on hybrid yield and specific activity of the probe, scan the screen for the appropriate amount of time. Analyze the data with ImageQuant software."

            "content": "**PROBLEM: Low polyribosome peaks.**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 1:  Cells had stopped growing at the time of harvest.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: Split cells at 1:2 ratio the day before harvesting or seed the plates with less cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 2: &#x201C;Runoff&#x201D; of ribosomes during harvesting and extraction of the cells. \r\n\n\nSOLUTION: Cool cells as quickly as possible and keep all solutions cold. Also, cycloheximide is included to minimize this problem. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PROBLEM: The dye fronts on the agarose gels do not run straight, giving the bands the appearance of either a smile or a frown.**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON: Salt in the RNA pellet. \r\n\n\nSOLUTION: Rinse RNA pellet with sufficient 75% ethanol, and be sure to completely remove the supernatant.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PROBLEM: Uneven or poor RNA transfer from gel to nylon membrane.**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 1: Wick contacts the Whatman paper and paper towel underneath gel.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: For efficient transfer, the 20X SSC must only pass through the gel and nylon membrane. To avoid &#x201C;short circuiting,&#x201D; cut all materials to the size of the gel, and mask around the gel with strips of parafilm. Make sure that the wick is not touching the paper towel and gel.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 2: Air bubbles.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: When setting up transfer, take care not to introduce bubbles between layers; it is especially important to avoid bubbles between the gel and membrane. As each component is added to the blot, a pipette can be used to gently roll out bubbles.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 3: Insufficient time for transfer.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: Be sure the side of the gel corresponding to the bottom of the wells is against the membrane. This minimizes the distance the RNA must migrate out of the gel to the membrane.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PROBLEM: Faint or no signal on blot .**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 1: The specific activity of the probe is too low.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: Make sure that the radioactively labelled dNTPs are not too old \\(use within 2-3 weeks). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 2: Stringency is too high.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION:  Decrease time or temperature of washes. The hybridization temperature may also be lowered, but this may increase the background.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 3: RNA is degraded.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: Use DEPC-water for all reagents, and keep all plastics and glassware RNase free. Work fast, wear gloves, and keep everything cold where indicated. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PROBLEM: High background.**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 1: Not enough washing, or washes not stringent enough. \r\n\n\nSOLUTION: Increase the number of washes and/or washing times. Temperature may also be increased, but this may result in loss of a specific signal if stringency becomes too high.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPOSSIBLE REASON 2: Precipitates in washing buffer. The wash buffer contains salts and SDS that may precipitate at room temperature. Accumulation of these precipitates on the membrane can result in increased background.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: Warm solution to between 37<sup>o</sup>C and 43<sup>o</sup>C to re-dissolve any precipitates before use."

            "content": "A typical polyribosome profile obtained from actively growing 293T cells is shown in Fig 3. We have routinely observed that the confluency of cells has a significant effect on the gradient profiles. A decrease in the ratio between heavy polyribosomes and monosomes typically indicates that cells have reached the stationary phase of growth during which the overall rate of protein synthesis has slowed. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIf an mRNA is actively translated, this method should allow detection of the mRNA in the fractions containing polyribosomes. When EDTA is added, the mRNA should shift to lighter fractions. This size of the mRNA will determine its position in the gradient after EDTA treatment. A larger mRNA will usually be detected further down in the gradient than a smaller species \\(depending on the size of the mRNP complex). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAlthough RT-PCR can be used to detect the mRNA extracted from the sucrose gradients, the Northern blot protocol has the advantage that it can give simultaneous information about alternatively spliced mRNAs and size. Also, it allows for more accurate quantification of the mRNA present in the different fractions."
