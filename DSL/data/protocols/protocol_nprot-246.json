            "content": "Heterocyclic rings, such as pyrrolidines, tetrahydrofurans and piperidines, are found in the vast majority of natural product molecules including many of those exhibiting a wide variety of potent biological activities. These heterocyclic rings are often highly substituted and constitute part of complex structures and, therefore, represent a significant challenge to synthetic chemists. The use of aromatic compounds as precursors to these structural motifs is an attractive option because, by controlling the degree of reduction achieved, dihydro or tetrahydro compounds can be formed selectively. These can then be reacted further, increasing substitution and complexity, via use of a wide variety of standard synthetic chemistry found within the literature.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe Birch \\(Li/NH<sub>3</sub>) and ammonia-free \\(Li/di- _tert_-butyl biphenyl \\[DBB])<sup>1</sup> partial reductions, using the conditions developed by Donohoe, are applicable to a wide range of heteroaromatic compounds with a variety of substitution patterns, resulting in formation of the respective dihydro compounds in typically good to excellent yields.<sup>2-8</sup>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe reduction of the _N_-Boc pyrrole whose formation is described herein,<sup>9</sup> \\(Figure 1) has recently been published by Donohoe et al. as a key step in the routes to the biologically active natural products 1-epiaustraline and hyacinthacine A<sub>1</sub>.<sup>10, 11</sup> \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Figure 1**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/480/display/Figure%201AAA.png\">See figure in Figures section.</a>"

Glassware should be allowed to cool to room temperature by either storage in a dessicator containing self-indicating silica gel or by attaching to a high-vacuum line. It is advisable to collect a sufficient quantity of THF \\(from either the distillation apparatus or Grubbs column apparatus) in an Erlenmeyer flask before starting the reaction and then removing solvent from here during the reaction procedure. Prior to collection of the THF the Erlenmeyer flask should be capped with a rubber septum and attached to the manifold line using a disposable syringe needle.

Attach the tubing adaptor to a double manifold allowing access to both an argon line and a high vacuum.\r\n\n\n2] Evacuate the flask using the vacuum line and refill with argon three times. Then maintain under a gentle flow of argon. Using a cannular transfer 200 mL of dry THF from a conical flask \\(which should be kept under an atmosphere of argon) into the reaction flask. Turn the magnetic stirrer on.\r\n\n\n3] Transfer 27 mL \\(0.16 mol) of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine to the round-bottomed flask with a glass-syringe fitted with a 21 gauge needle. Cool the flask to \u201378 \u00baC in a dry ice/acetone bath \\(Dewar dish). The temperature of the bath should be monitored using a thermometer in the dewar dish.\r\n\n\n4] Using a cannular transfer 100 mL of _n_-butyllithium \\(1.6 M in hexanes) in a dropwise fashion from a 100 mL bottle \\(which should be kept under an atmosphere of argon) into the reaction flask.\r\n\n\n5] Transfer 10.7 mL \\(0.64 mol) of _N_-Boc pyrrole into a 100 mL pear-shaped flask. Cap with a rubber septum and attach to the manifold line using a disposable syringe needle. Evacuate and refill with argon three times and then maintain under a gentle flow of argon. \r\n\n\n6] Transfer 45 mL dry THF to the pear-shaped flask with a glass-syringe fitted with a 21 gauge needle. Swirl the flask by hand until all the _N_-Boc pyrrole has fully dissolved into the THF.\r\n\n\n7] Add the solution of pyrrole in THF in a dropwise fashion \\(approx. 10 min) into the reaction flask using a glass-syringe fitted with a 21 gauge needle. Maintain vigorous stirring during the addition and ensure that the bath temperature is kept at \u221278 \u00b0C by addition of dry ice and acetone as required.\r\n\n\n8] Continue stirring for 3 hours at \u221278 \u00b0C. \r\n\n\n9] Fit a second 1 L round-bottomed two-necked flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar with a rubber septum in the main neck and also a tubing adaptor. Attach the tubing adaptor to a double manifold allowing access to both an argon line and a high vacuum.\r\n\n\n10] Evacuate the flask using the vacuum line and refill with argon three times. Then maintain under a gentle flow of argon. Using a cannular transfer 20 mL of dry THF from a conical flask \\(which should be kept under an atmosphere of argon) into the reaction flask. Turn the magnetic stirrer on.\r\n\n\n11] Transfer 14.8 mL \\(0.19 mol) of methyl chloroformate to the round-bottomed flask with a glass-syringe fitted with a 21 gauge needle. Cool the flask to \u201378 \u00baC in a dry ice/acetone bath \\(Dewar dish). The temperature of the bath should be monitored using a thermometer in the dewar dish.\r\n\n\n12] Cannular the entire contents of the reaction mixture into the methyl chloroformate solution in a dropwise fashion \\(approx. 2 hours). The cannular should be cooled by wrapping it in a cotton wool jacket packed with dry ice. Maintain vigorous stirring during the addition and ensure that the bath temperature is kept at \u221278 \u00b0C by addition of dry ice and acetone as required.\r\n\n\n13] Continue stirring for 30 mins at \u221278 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n14] Add saturated ammonium chloride solution \\(20 mL) slowly using a glass syringe and reusable 21 gauge needle. Remove the flask from the cooling bath and allow to warm to room temperature\r\n\n\n15] Transfer the reaction mixture to a 2 L separating funnel containing distilled water \\(150 mL) and diethyl ether \\(200 mL). Separate the layers and extract the aqueous layer with four 100 mL portions of diethyl ether. Wash the combined organic layers with 1 M hydrochloric acid \\(100 mL) followed by brine \\(100 mL). Dry the combined organic layers with magnesium sulfate \\(approx. 5 g).\r\n\n\n16] Filter the mixture through filter paper into a round-bottomed flask and evaporate the solvent to dryness using a rotary evaporator. **PAUSE POINT:** The reaction mixture can be left overnight at room temperature.\r\n\n\n17] Purify the desired product by flash column chromatography on silica gel eluting with 1:4 diethyl ether to petroleum spirit to yield a pale yellow solid. This can then be recrystallised from cyclohexane to afford the desired product as a white crystalline solid."
