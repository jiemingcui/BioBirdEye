            "content": "Recent advances in epigenomics have enabled genome-wide identification of enhancers in various tissues and species. However, these do not allow direct quantification of enhancer activity. Several studies have focused on the implementation of high-throughput gene reporter assays for large scale testing of enhancer activity. Among them, a technique named Starr-seq enabling genome-wide quantification of enhancer activity in Drosophila cell lines has been developed<sup>1</sup> and have been extensively used to interrogate enhancer function<sup>2</sup>. One major limitation for its application to mammalian systems resides in their genome size and complexity, rendering challenging the preparation of representative libraries and requiring very high sequencing depth. To circumvent this problem, we developed CapStarr-seq, a technique capturing genomic sequences of interest for high-throughput assessment of enhancer activity in mammals<sup>3</sup>. Here, we detail the step to perform CapStarr-seq as shown in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3933/original/Fig1.pdf?1444417933\" > Figure 1 </a>. The provided protocol largely correspond the one described in Vanhille et al.<sup>3</sup>, except that primers and adaptors are designed for the Illumina platform, thus allowing multiplexing sequencing. We also provide suggestions for improvement at various points during the procedure. CapStarr-Seq is a fast and cost-effective approach to assess the activity of potential enhancers for a given cell type and will be helpful in decrypting transcription regulation mechanisms applicable to a wide range of biological questions."

Here, size selection is based on the use of Agencourt AMPure XP beads \\(Beckman Coulter, A63881).The following bead-to-sample ratio is used to make a library size distribution with a peak size of 300 bp. For a different library size, the bead-to-sample ratio will need to be adjusted.\r\n\n\na. Homogenize AMPure XP beads at RT before use.\r\n\n\nb.

The identification and the characterization of enhancers are challenging in mammals due to their genome complexity. Here we describe the CapStarr-Seq procedure \\(Vanhille et al. Nat Commun. 2015. doi: 10.1038/ncomms7905), a high-throughput strategy to quantitatively assess enhancer activity in mammals. This approach couples capture of regions of interest to previously developed Starr-seq technique. CapStarr-Seq is applicable to a wide range of biological questions and will provide an efficient tool to better decipher mechanisms involved in gene regulation.",
