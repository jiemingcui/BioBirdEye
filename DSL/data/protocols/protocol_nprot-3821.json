            "content": "Glycosylation is the most common form of co-translational and post-translational modification, with as many as 70% of all human proteins estimated to contain one or more glycan chains \\[1], and it is an enzyme-directed site-specific process \\[2]. Glycosylation is critical for a wide range of biological processes, including cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and protein-ligand interactions in the cell \\[2, 3]. Two types of protein glycosylation exist: N-glycosylation to the amide nitrogen of asparagine \\(Asn) side chains and O-glycosylation to the hydroxyl groups of serine \\(Ser) and threonine \\(Thr) side chains \\[4-6]. Glycoproteins can be detected, purified and analyzed by different strategies, including lectin microarray \\[7], hydrazide chemistry, stable isotope labeling \\[8], glycoproteome and glycome analysis by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry \\[9], respectively .\r\n\n\nIn the past two decades, one of the main ways to investigate glycosylation was by using lectins \\[10]. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that may interact with high specificity to a soluble carbohydrate or to a carbohydrate moiety that is a part of a glycoprotein or a glycolipid \\[10, 11]. With the advent of high-throughput glycomic techniques, such as lectin microarray, which is a novel platform for glycan analysis, having emerged only in recent years \\[7, 12]. The display of the lectins in a microarray enables the multiple and distinct binding glycopatterns to be observed simultaneously, providing information on the carbohydrate composition of the samples \\[4, 13]. Lectin blotting method is an effective biochemical technique based on lectin\u2013glycan interactions, by which it is possible to identify rapidly the glycoproteins of interest by comparison with a reference SDS-PAGE protein map, and to obtain reliable and reproducible results \\[14]. It is used to detect and characterize carbohydrate epitopes on protein or lipids \\[15]. The methodology could work together with the lectin microarrays for screening, analysis and validation of the important glycoproteins from complex protein samples. In this protocol, we provide a detailed methodology of lectin microarray and lectin blotting for protein glycopattern analysis. This method is robust and can be used for complex human samples \\(saliva, serum, tissue), cell lysates, and other samples to monitor glycosylation pattern following extracellular signal transduction. \r\n\n\nWe describe herein a detailed protocol for analyzing and verifying the glycopatterns of glycoproteins in human saliva using the lectin microarray and lectin blotting."

The results of the Sia\u03b12-6Gal/GalNAc binder SNA and the Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4Glc\\(NAc)/Glc binder MAL-II blotting analysis showed that the different apparent bands belong to a molecular weight range of 10 kDa to 260 kDa for all groups. However, the SNA apparent band between 25 kDa and 260 kDa for the healthy groups was distinguished from the clinical groups. The MAL-II apparent band between 10 kDa and 260 kDa for the healthy groups was distinguished from the clinical groups. The summed fluorescence intensities \\(SFIs) of the band marked by a red line at approximately 25 kDa for all salivary groups from lane 1 to lane 4 were shown in Figure 2A. The SFIs of SNA and MAL-II from each clinical group were compared with the healthy group. According to the results, the expression level of the terminal Sia\u03b12-6Gal of all elderly groups with T2DM was up-regulated, and the terminal Sia\u03b12-3Gal of all elderly groups with T2DM was down-regulated. The blotting analyses of SNA and MAL-II to all salivary groups agreed with the results of the lectin microarrays."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "In the past two decades, one of the main ways to investigate glycosylation was using lectins. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that discriminate glycans based on subtle differences in structure. Recently, with the advent of high-throughput glycomic techniques, such as lectin microarray which is a system biology approach is utilized in order to draw general conclusions of protein glycosylation about a biological sample. The display of the lectins in a microarray enables the multiple and distinct binding glycopatterns to be observed simultaneously, providing information on the carbohydrate composition of the samples. The lectin blotting can be used to verify rapidly the target glycopatterns of glycoproteins by comparison with a reference SDS-PAGE protein map, and obtain reliable and reproducible results according to the lectin microarrays. Here, the lectin microarrays are used to probe the relative expression levels of terminal \u03b12-3/6-linked sialic acids in human saliva from type 2 diabetes mellitus \\(T2DM). And, lectin blotting is used to confirm the different abundance of the terminal Sia\u03b12-6Gal and Sia\u03b12-3Gal between T2DM and healthy group according to the results of the lectin microarrays. In this protocol, we provide a detailed methodology of lectin microarray and lectin blotting for protein glycopattern analysis.",
