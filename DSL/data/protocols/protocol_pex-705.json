            "content": "<p>Combining the nanoscale localization information from super-resolution light microscopy with ultrastructure context from EM, SR-CLEM is a versatile imaging tool. Fluorescent probe and labeling strategy that can balance the LM fluorescence, EM contrast and structural preservation are in great demand. Genetically encoded fluorescent proteins (FPs) are widely used in SR-CLEM for its specificity and biocompatibility. However, the strong oxidizer osmic acid (OsO<sub>4</sub>) and the hydrophobic embedding resin Epon will destroy the fluorescence of existing FPs. With mEosEM, a newly developed PCFP that has OsO<sub>4 </sub>and Epon embedding resistance, the same-section SR-CLEM under conventional chemical fixation condition with FP is enabled. The procedure described in this Protocol Exchange chapter focuses on detailing the SR-CLEM process of same-section Epon-embedding sample using mEosEM, and is related to the Nature Methods manuscript NMETH-BC38466B titled: \"An Epon embedding- and osmium acid-resistant fluorescent protein for superresolution CLEM\".</p>"

In a chemical fume hood, remove the supernatant and add 1 ml of prewarmed fixative (4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM PBS, pH 7.2) to the 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Use a toothpick to make the cell pellet into 0.5\u20131 mm\n3\npieces and incubate at 4 \u00b0C for 12 h, blocking light.\n4.\u00a0Wash the cell pellets with ice-cold H\n2\nO three times for 5 min on ice, blocking light.\n5.\u00a0Postfix the cell pellet in 1% OsO\n4\nin a fume hood for 1 h on ice, blocking light.\n6. Wash the cell pellet with ice-cold H\n2\nO three times for 5 min on ice, blocking light.\n7. Cells were stained\nen bloc\nwith 2% UA for 1 h on ice, blocking light.\n8.\u00a0Wash the cells with ice-cold H\n2\nO three times for 5 min on ice, blocking light.\n9.\u00a0Dehydrate cells in increasing concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%) for 6 min each on ice and further dehydrate cells in 100% acetone one time for 6 min at room temperature, blocking light.\n10.\u00a0Prepare Epon resin (50% Epon812, 30.5% NMA, 18% DDSA, 1.5% DMP-30).\n11. Infiltrate the cell pellet with 25% Epon in acetone at room temperature for 1 h on shaker, blocking light.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0Infiltrate the cell pellet with 50% Epon in acetone at room temperature for 2 h on shaker, blocking light.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0Infiltrate the cell pellet with 75% Epon in acetone at room temperature for 3 h on shaker, blocking light.\n14.\u00a0\u00a0Infiltrate the cell pellet with 100% Epon at room temperature two times for 12 h on shaker, blocking light.\n15.\u00a0\u00a0Embed the cell pellet in 100% Epon at 60 \u00b0C for 12 h, blocking light.\n16.\u00a0\u00a0Coverslip cleaning. Coverslips were washed in a mixture of 250 ml of H\n2\nO, 50 ml of ammonium hydroxide, and 50 ml of hydrogen peroxide in a 500 ml beaker for 2 h at 142 \u00b0C. After being rinsed 6 times in H\n2\nO, the coverslips were carefully transferred to a beaker containing anhydrous ethyl alcohol overnight and dried on a clean bench.\n17.\u00a0\u00a0Pioloform coating of coverslips (Figure 1). To coat a coverslip with Pioloform, we placed a glass slide on the desktop centrifuge using double-sided adhesive tape and then mounted a coverslip on the glass slide. Then, 75 \u00b5l of 1% Pioloform in chloroform was applied to the coverslip before spinning for 3 min. This treatment produced a thin layer of Pioloform on top of the coverslip. The coverslip was then coated with 250 \u00b5l of 0.1% fresh poly-L-lysine for 1 h. Then, 80-nm gold nanoparticles were diluted with H\n2\nO to 25% and sonicated for 15 min. The poly-L-lysine was rinsed off with H\n2\nO, and the coverslip was blow-dried. Finally, the diluted gold nanoparticles were placed on the coverslip for 1 h, and the coverslip was rinsed with H\n2\nO and blow-dried\n1\n.\n18.\u00a0\u00a0Cut sections to 100 nm using Ultra-microtome (Leica, EM UC6). Place a section on the center of the pioloform coating of coverslip.\n19.\u00a0\u00a0Mowiol imaging buffer. Add Mowiol 4-88 (2.4 g) and H\n2\nO (6 ml) to glycerol (6 g), stir to mix and leave for 12 h at room temperature. Add 0.2 M Tris-Cl (12 ml, pH 8.5) and heat at 50\u00b0C for 20 min. After the Mowiol dissolves, add DABCO to 2.5% to reduce fading.\n20.\u00a0\u00a0To find the section, draw a circle using marking pen around the section on the other side of the pioloform coated coverslip. Add 10 \u00b5l Mowiol imaging buffer on the section and coat another coverslip on the section. Place the coverslips in the chamber and make sure that the drawn circle is on the top side.\n21.\u00a0\u00a0Add one drop of oil on the objective and place the chamber with the coverslips and section on the imaging stage. Incubate for 30 min to recover the fluorescence. Find the drawn circle and the section using 10 \u00d7 DIC. Take the SMLM imaging using 100 \u00d7,1.49 NA oil objective (Olympus PLAN APO) plus a 1.6 \u00d7 intermediate magnification with an image pixel size of 100 nm. 2000\u20135000 frames were recorded by an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Andor iXon DV-897 BV) in frame transfer mode with exposure time of 50-ms/frame. Excitation light was generated from a Sapphire laser (Coherent) of 488 nm, at 0.6-2 kW/cm\n2\n. Activation light was generated from an OBIS laser (Coherent) of 405 nm, at 5 W/cm\n2\n, with 1 s/pulse and 10-ms exposure time. In order to acquire the signal of gold nanoparticles, increased excitation light of 10-20 kW/cm\n2\nwere applied at the end of the SMLM data acquisition.\n22.\u00a0\u00a0After the SMLM imaging, take different magnification DIC images (160 \u00d7, 100 \u00d7, 40 \u00d7, 16 \u00d7, 10 \u00d7).\n23.\u00a0\u00a0Clean the oil using 100% ethanol.\n24.\u00a0\u00a0Separate two coverslips in H\n2\nO carefully and rinse the pioloform coated coverslip to remove Mowiol imaging buffer.\n25.\u00a0\u00a0Score a rectangular area surrounding the image section in the coverslip.\n26.\u00a0\u00a0Add 10 \u00b5l of 12% HF on the scored rectangle.\n27.\u00a0\u00a0Tilt the coverslip slightly and let the HF seep into the Pioloform film.\n28.\u00a0\u00a0Fill a glass jar with water. Put the coverslip slowly into the water to float the Pioloform membrane carefully.\n29.\u00a0\u00a0Put an uncoated slot grid on the floating film to capture the section in the center of the opening grid.\n30.\u00a0\u00a0Coat the glass slide with Parafilm.\n31.\u00a0\u00a0Use Parafilm coated glass slide to pick up the floating film with the grid.\n32.\u00a0\u00a0After drying, carefully remove the grid from the Parafilm.\n33.\u00a0\u00a0Add a drop of 2% UA on a piece of Parafilm on the desk. Put the slot grid on the top of the 2% UA droplet, section side down, for 15 min, blocking light.\n34.\u00a0\u00a0Pass the slot grid over nine deionized water droplets for washing.\n35.\u00a0\u00a0Dry the slot grid with filter paper.\n36.\u00a0\u00a0Place a piece of Parafilm in a Petri dish. To absorb excess carbon dioxide from the air in the Petri dish, add a few NaOH pellets inside the dish and cover the Petri dish for 5 min. Add a drop of Sato\u2019s triple lead (filtered through a 0.2-\u00b5m filter) onto the Parafilm. Put the slot grid on the top of the lead droplet, section side down. Put the cover back on the Petri dish and stain for 5 min.\n37.\u00a0\u00a0Pass the slot grid over nine deionized water droplets for washing.\n38.\u00a0\u00a0Dry the slot grid with filter paper. The slot grid is now ready for TEM imaging.\n39.\u00a0\u00a0TEM imaging. Find the same cell using different magnification DIC images (160 X, 100 X, 40 X 16 X, 10 X). TEM images were taken using MORADA G3 camera on FEI Spirit TEM operated at 100 kV with 1 s exposure time.\n40.\u00a0\u00a0SMLM analysis was performed using custom routines in MATLAB as described previously\n2\n, with a modification to remove the background and the noise. The reconstruction parameters were shown in Figure 2.\n41.\u00a0\u00a0eC-CLEM was used to register the LM image with EM image using gold nanoparticles as fiducial makers using non rigid (2D or 3D) mode\n3\n. The whole predicted error map given by eC-CLEM could be used to evaluate the registration accuracy."

The advantage of this method is to simultaneously obtain high-quality LM and EM images from the same ultrathin section of Epon-embedded sample after conventional chemical fixation.&nbsp;</p>",
