            "content": "Transfection of therapeutic genes to retinal pigment epithelial cells has many potential applications for the treatment of ocular diseases. This protocol has been systematically optimized to obtain reproducible, high-level gene transfer to retinal pigment epithelial cells \\(ARPE-19) _in vitro_, using branched polyethyleneimine \\(PEI) as a gene carrier and secreted _Renilla_ Luciferase as a reporter protein. In a first stage of the protocol development, different parameters, including cell density at seeding, PEI/DNA charge ratio, composition of the preparation buffer and nanoparticulate assembly conditions as well as incubation time of the nanoparticulates with ARPE-19 cells, were optimized in a matrix-like fashion. Selection of the most effective conditions for gene transfer led to the finalization of the present protocol, with which transgene expression efficacies of 10-20 ng/ml are typically obtained. Cell viability is 60-80% depending on the incubation time of the nanoparticulates with cells. This protocol has been optimized for ARPE-19 cells and for PEI as gene carrier. However, with minor changes, it should be suitable also for transfection of other cultured cells, as well as for different polymeric carriers."

            "content": "Self-assembly of plasmid DNA and carrier is due to electrostatic interaction, induced by the attraction between the anionic DNA and the cationic carrier polymer. The stability of these nanoparticulates depends on the strength of the electrostatic interaction and thus on the total charge and the charge density of the carrier molecule as well as the ionic strength of the solution used. In general, colloidal stability is being achieved by working with an excess of cationic charge, that is, carrier polymer, to ensure complete coating of the DNA. This creates charged nanoparticulates that are stabilized by the electrostatic repulsion. The hydrodynamic diameter of PEI/DNA charge ratio 2/1 nanoparticulates is ~300 nm, as determined by dynamic light scattering method. DLS also reveals the polydisperse nature of the polyplexes. Complex size is a potentially important property of synthetic gene delivery vectors. DNA complexes tend to form particulate systems \\(i.e., size range of 0.05&#x2013;1 &#x3BC;m) with the exact size depending on a number of factors such as, for example, DNA to carrier ratio, type of carrier, ionic strength of the buffer, and kinetics of mixing. The same PEI/DNA charge ratio 2/1 nanoparticulates, if prepared in 10 mM Hepes buffer without addition of salt, are much smaller in size \\(70 nm). Zabner et al. \\(J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1995) have shown that whilst a large amount of DNA is effectively delivered to the cell, only a small percentage is released from the endosomes, and even less makes its way from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it is transcribed. Therefore larger nanoparticulates that sediment faster and can bear a larger DNA dose, may have some advantages over smaller vector systems. Transgene peak expression efficacy typically obtained with this protocol using ARPE19 cells and PEI/DNA charge ratio 2/1 is in the range of 10 ng/ml for 1 h incubation time and 20 ng/ml for 2h incubation \\(Figure 1). The profile shows in both cases a peak in expression on the second day. This is probably caused by the CMV promoter in the plasmid. Cell viability is higher if the contact of the nanoparticulates with the cells is minimized; 80% for 1h and 60-70% for 2h incubation times \\(Figure 1)."
