            "content": "As a conserved structure in the zona pellucida, communicating microvilli or transzonal projections (TZPs) have been well documented to exist between oocytes and granulosa cells (GCs) in ovarian follicles of different species including the mammals. However, the origin and the detail structure of these communicating structures are elusive since lacking of cell specific labeling method and high-resolution imaging approach. To visualize the microvilli structures and distinguish oocytic cellular origin during follicle development, we used an mT/mG reporter mouse model[1] in which membrane-localized GFP (mG) is inducible expressed in Cre-positive cells by crossing with oocyte-specific Gdf9-Cre mice[2]. We established a 3D high-resolution imaging system to distinguish the derivation of microvilli by drawing the outlines of the cellular membrane with mG."

Only the healthy oocytes with an average diameter around 65 \u03bcm were collected for the further experiments.\n(4) Washing the collected oocytes three times with ~50 \u03bcL culture medium microdroplet by mouth pipette gently.\n*Tips: Transferring the oocytes gently to guarantee the integrity of ZP.\n4.\nImaging the cellular membrane structure on living oocytes:\n(1) Transfer around 10 oocytes to the culture medium microdroplet (~20 \u03bcL) in 35 mm glass bottom dish.\n(2) Covered the microdroplet with 1.5 mL mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich).\n(3) Photographed in a living cell workstation (Okolab) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nby Andor Dragonfly 502 spinning-disc confocal with following index. In details, images were acquired by an Andor Dragonfly 502 spinning-disc confocal microscope equipped with a 63\u00d7, 1.40 N.A. oil objective (Leica HC PL APO), a scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera (Andor Zyla 4.2), and 488-nm (mG) and 568-nm (mT) lines of the Andor Integrated Laser Engine (ILE) system with a spinning-disc confocal scan head (Andor Dragonfly 500). The oocytes were acquired through z-step mode with the index. In detail, images were acquired with laser 488-nm around 10-20%, laser 568-nm around 15-25%, exposure time 100-200 ms and Z-step 0.5-0.7 \u03bcm for 25-35 \u03bcm by Fusion 2.1 software.\n(\nhttps://andor.oxinst.com/products/dragonfly#fusion\n).\n(4) After acquisition, videos or single time-point images were processed by ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) for projection of all z-stacks and merged color channels.\n(5) To finally detect the Oo-Mv on oocyte, the rotary 3D video was processed by Imaris (https://imaris.oxinst.com/) software.\n*Tips: The index of imaging might be changed with the situations of microscope such as the environment temperature and humidity."
