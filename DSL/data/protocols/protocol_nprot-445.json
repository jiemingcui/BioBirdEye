            "content": "Genomic instabilities including chromosomal translocations are frequently associated with genetic diseases and cancer, especially leukemia. Cytogenetic studies of these diseases requiring preparation of metaphase chromosomes are often key to revealing their chromosomal abnormalities. Treatment of in vitro disease cell cultures with cell cycle inhibitors, e.g. colcemid, have proved to be a very simple and effective metaphase preparation method for cytogenetic studies. Two good examples are metaphase preparation from cultured cells and some types of myeloid leukemia. However, this approach has some limitions and disadvantages: 1) it is difficult to grow many types of primary cell in vitro; 2) in vitro cultures tend to introduce additional artificial mutations to the genome. To overcome these issues, we have established an approach to prepare metaphase chromosomes directly from murine bone marrow. With this new approach, we were able to get 5-10% of metaphase chromosomes from primary bone marrow leukocytes and identify chromosomal translocations recurring in a Pten null murine model developing T cell leukemia \\(Figure 1,2 \\[1])."

Inject 250\u00b5L of 200\u00b5g/mL colcemid into the peritoneum of mice and arrest cell cycle for 30 minutes.\r\n  3. Flush bone marrow cells with 30mL pre-warmed 0.06M potassium chloride into 50mL tube through 40\u00b5m cell strainer and rock sample tubes gently in 37\u00b0C incubator for 20 min.\r\n  4. Make fixative solution \\(methanol \\[100%]:glacial acetic acid=3:1) during hypotonic incubation.\r\n  5. Add 2mL Fixative into samples, mix gently. Centrifuge at 1500rpm for 7 min and discard supernatant. \r\n  6. Resuspend cells thoroughly with 0.5mL 0.06M potassium chloride.\r\n  7. Add few drops of fixative to cells and mix well. Keep adding and mixing fixative drops into cells until reaching 3mL. Add fixative up to 20mL in total, mix by inversion, and incubate at room temperature for 10 min. \r\n  8. Run the sample mixtures through 40\u00b5m cell strainer. Centrifuge at 1500rpm for 7 min and discard supernatant.\r\n  9. Resuspend pellets in 20 mL fixative and incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Centrifuge at 1500rpm for 7 min and discard supernatant.\r\n  10. Repeat step 9 once.\r\n  11. Resuspend cell pellets in 2mL fixative and store at -20\u00b0C for long-term storage.\r\n  12. To determine chromosome quality, use the flame method or other ways to spread and stain chromosomes on slides. Drop 30\u00b5L fixed cells onto pre-cleaned and wet slides tilted at a 45 degree angle. Put slides in burner flame for 2 seconds to allow chromosomes to spread out. Let slides dry.\r\n  13. dilute 20x Giemsa stain with water to 1x Giemsa solution. Stain chromosome spread slides with 1x Giemsa solution for 5 minutes. Wash off Giemsa solution and let slides dry. Check chromosome quality under microscope."

It is very important to remove cell debris through 40&#xB5;m cell strainer beside filtering at Step 3.\r\n\n\nStep 12. Slides have to be rinsed and cleaned in distilled water before use. Otherwise, the quality of the Giemsa-stained slides will be compromised. \r\n\n\nStep 13. Stain chromosome slides with 1x Giesma solution for 5 minutes at most. Excess staining time tends to result in overdarkened chromosomes."
