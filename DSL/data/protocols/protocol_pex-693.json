Replace the medium every day.\n7) For posterior gut cell induction, change medium to the Medium for Posterior gut spheroid induction (Gut growth medium including 500 ng/ml FGF4 and 3 \u00b5M CHIR99021).

Re-suspend the A-P spheroid in 20 -30 \u00b5L/spheroid/well of 100 % Matrigel (Phenol Red-Free) on ice and plate it on 24 well tissue culture plate (VWR international) to make Matrigel drop.\n15) Incubate the drop in CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C for 5 minutes.\n16) Flip the plate upside down and incubate for another 5 minutes to prevent the spheroid from attaching bottom.\n17) Add Gut growth medium enough to cover entire drop and culture for 4 days to generate Hepato-biliary-pancreatic organoids (HBPOs)."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Organogenesis is a complex and inter-connected process, orchestrated by multiple boundary tissue interactions. Here, we established the protocol of the continuous patterning of hepatic, biliary and pancreatic structures from a three-dimensional culture of human pluripotent stem cell (PSC). The boundary interactions between anterior and posterior gut spheroids differentiated from human PSCs enables autonomous emergence of hepato-biliary-pancreatic (HBP) organ domains in the absence of extrinsic factor supply.<strong> </strong>This anterior-poterior gut interaction protocol can be used to model the early human HBP organogenesis process <em>in vitro</em>.</p>",
