            "content": "**1. Introduction: pseudopodia proteomics in cancer invasion research**\r\n\n\nPseudopodia are dynamic, actin-rich cellular protrusions essential for cell and tissue motility. The polarized formation of pseudopodial protrusions during cell migration plays a critical role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes including cancer metastasis<sup>1-3</sup>. Many lines of evidence have suggested that many cancer-associated proteins are involved in pseudopodia formation, promoting invasive migration of tumor cells. Pseudopodial actin-rich structures, which play a central role in pseudopodia functions, are aberrantly regulated in various cancers<sup>4</sup>. Protein kinases such as focal adhesion kinase and Src kinase were found to be enriched in pseudopodial protrusions, and various phosphorylated proteins were observed in pseudopodia<sup>5,6</sup>. Glycolytic enzymes colocalized with pseudopodial actin structures may supply energy for the formation of pseudopodial protrusions and promote motility of tumor cells<sup>7</sup>. Cancer-associated cytokines stimulate intracellular signaling pathways and subsequently facilitate actin reorganization and pseudopodial protrusions<sup>8,9</sup>. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a critical process in cancer cell invasion and metastasis, is regulated by pseudopodial proteins<sup>10</sup>. These observations indicate that a variety of unique proteins are involved in pseudopodia formation and function in a cooperative manner. Therefore, the identification of pseudopodia-specific proteins using global protein expression profiling methods such as pseudopodia proteomics will reveal the mechanisms underlying tumor cell invasion and migration. Moreover, as the disruption of pseudopodia formation suppresses metastasis of tumor cells, the identification of pseudopodia-specific proteins may lead to the development of novel approaches to cancer therapy<sup>1-3</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2. Technical challenges in pseudopodia proteomics**\r\n\n\nIn the model system of pseudopodia formation, cells are plated on a porous membrane positioned over conditioned chemoattractant-containing medium and allowed to extend pseudopodia through the membrane pores \\(Figure 1)<sup>7</sup>. As pseudopodia are a rich source of metastasis-associated proteins, pseudopodia proteomics is an attractive approach to investigate cancer biology. Although several studies have reported global protein composition of pseudopodia and a number of intriguing proteins have been identified, there are still many technical challenges in pseudopodia proteomics. Pseudopodia proteomics involves three major steps: pseudopodia purification, protein expression profiling, and functional evaluation of the identified pseudopodia-specific proteins. All these steps have inherent limitations that compromise the current approach to pseudopodia proteomics. \r\n\n\nFirst, pseudopodia should be separated from a cell body without damage to their structure. In the previous studies, for the isolation of pseudopodia, cells were seeded on a porous membrane, and cell bodies were manually wiped off the top of the membrane with a cotton-tipped swab. Subsequently, proteins were extracted from the membrane containing pseudopodial protrusions and subjected to protein expression profiling<sup>5,11,12</sup>. Although this approach has led to the identification of a considerable number of pseudopodia-associated proteins, the manual isolation of pseudopodia may potentially cause contamination with cell body proteins; in addition, pseudopodia may be mechanically damaged during isolation by an operator. As the protein amount in a cell body exceeds that in a pseudopodium by more than ten times, cell bodies have to be completely removed from the membrane in the process of pseudopodia isolation. On the other hand, stringent wiping of cell bodies with a cotton swab may result in the loss of functionally important pseudopodia proteins with low expression levels. Thus, a novel approach is needed for the precise isolation of intact pseudopodia from cell bodies in a controlled, operator-independent manner.\r\n\n\nSecond, pseudopodia proteomics analysis should be conducted in a quantitative way. Pseudopodia-specific proteins are identified by the comparison between the protein expression profiles in cell bodies and pseudopodia. As some proteins may be present both in the cell body and pseudopodia but expressed at different levels, pseudopodia proteomics should be performed in a more directly quantitative manner. Previous studies have used mass spectrometry to identify pseudopodia proteins; however, although a number of pseudopodial proteins have been described with this method, the protein expression patterns in pseudopodia and cell bodies were not quantitatively evaluated<sup>5</sup>. For example, using mass spectrometry, Shankar et al. compared the protein contents in pseudopodia and cell bodies, but not the protein expression profiles<sup>10</sup>. Quantitative comparison was achieved by using the isotope-labeling method. Wang et al. applied the <sup>16</sup>O/<sup>18</sup>O labeling method to compare cell body and pseudopodia protein expression<sup>12</sup>. In this method, the proteins of two samples were digested with trypsin and labeled separately with <sup>16</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>O, which were incorporated into peptide carboxyl groups in a sequence-independent manner. The samples were mixed, and the relative abundance of <sup>16</sup>O-labeled and <sup>18</sup>O-labeled peptides was evaluated by mass spectrometry. The <sup>16</sup>O/<sup>18</sup>O labeling method has enabled precise comparison of thousands of peptides in small samples; however, the linear dynamic range of detection in mass spectrometry is limited to 10<sup>2</sup>\u201310<sup>3</sup> <sup>13</sup>. Considering that the dynamic range of protein expression reaches 10<sup>11</sup>, this method is not optimal for pseudopodia proteomics. As an alternative to mass spectrometry, the gel-based approach coupled with fluorescent labeling, such as two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis \\(2D-DIGE), has been for pseudopodia proteomics<sup>14,15</sup>. However, as the sensitivity of fluorescence detection in these studies was equivalent to that of silver staining, large protein amounts, from 50 to 170 \u03bcg<sup>14,15</sup>, were required for protein expression profiling. As the amount of pseudopodia proteins is quite limited, a more sensitive method is needed to avoid laborious pseudopodia isolation and possible protein degradation. Proteomic modalities with a wide dynamic range and high sensitivity are required for pseudopodia protein profiling.\r\n\n\nThird, the biological properties of pseudopodial proteins identified by proteomics should be functionally verified by observing the effects on pseudopodia formation and elongation. In a previous study, the number of newly generated pseudopodia and the extent of extracellular matrix degradation were evaluated as parameters of tumor cell invasive potential<sup>16</sup>. In addition to newly generated pseudopodia, the effects on existing pseudopodia should also be assessed in a quantitative way.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3. A novel approach to pseudopodia proteomics**\r\n\n\nTo address the above-mentioned issues, we developed a novel approach to pseudopodia proteomics. Our systematic approach consists of three steps: isolation of pseudopodia from cell bodies by laser ablation, protein expression profiling using small amounts of pseudopodia protein extracts and highly sensitive fluorescent dyes, and functional evaluation of the newly identified pseudopodia proteins using confocal imaging.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3.1. Isolation of pseudopodia from cell bodies by excimer laser etching**\r\n\n\nTo isolate pseudopodia of tumor cells, we applied a medical device used for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis \\(LASIK), a procedure in ophthalmic refractive surgery. In LASIK, superficial anterior corneal tissue is reshaped by a topographically assisted excimer laser after the epithelium is flapped from the Bowman\u2019s layer \\(Figure 1)<sup>17</sup>. Surgical complications rarely occur in LASIK because the excimer laser ablates living tissues in a precisely horizontal manner without thermal damage to the underlying tissue layers<sup>18</sup>. In our method, cell ablation at the ventral level with the excimer laser completely removed cell bodies from the porous membrane, and the pseudopodia structures, which remained intact inside the pores, were treated with protein extraction buffer for subsequent protein expression profiling. The laser ablation was performed in an operator-independent manner.\r\n\n\nThe excimer laser-assisted cell etching technique allows the ablation of cell bodies without damaging pseudopodia in the pores. The idea is based on spatial parameters of the laser-cell interaction. In our experiments, the laser keratectomy system was equipped with an argon fluoride excimer laser with a wavelength of 193 nm. Peptide bonds \\(O=C\u2212N\u2212N) in the protein backbone absorb laser energy; at this wavelength, the optical tissue penetration depth is approximately 500 nm<sup>19</sup>. Therefore, possible protein degradation would be induced only within 500 nm from the pseudopodium base. Moreover, the membrane pore diameter \\(1\u20133 \u00b5m) exceeds the laser wavelength by 15 times; therefore, at 193 nm the membrane may exhibit a strong light-scattering effect. Thus, because of the ratio between the laser wavelength and pore size, the excimer laser pulses do not reach pseudopodia in the pores. We have demonstrated that there was no protein degradation in the isolated pseudopodia based on light microscopy and immunoblotting observations<sup>20</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3.2. 2D-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis \\(PAGE) with highly sensitive fluorescent dyes for the separation of a small amount of pseudopodia proteins **\r\n\n\nTo create quantitative protein expression profiles using a very small amount of proteins recovered from the isolated pseudopodia, we labeled the proteins with a highly sensitive fluorescent dye and separated them using 2D-DIGE. Two types of fluorescent dyes are available for 2D-DIGE, Cy3 and Cy5<sup>21,22</sup>, and the dyes with higher sensitivity have been used for pseudopodia proteomics<sup>22</sup>. \r\n\n\nProtein separation based on 2D-PAGE enables the quantitative comparative analysis of thousands of proteins and has been used in a variety of research applications. In a classical 2D-PAGE analysis, proteins are separated according to their isoelectric point and molecular weight and identified using colorimetric detection such as silver staining; protein expression is then evaluated based on relative staining intensity. The drawback of using 2D-PAGE with silver staining is its narrow linear dynamic range of protein detection \\(10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>23</sup>, which hampers quantitative comparison, as is the case with mass spectrometry. According to our previous findings, 2D-PAGE coupled with silver staining required cell material from more than five sheets of porous membranes<sup>20</sup>. Thus, although 2D-PAGE is one of the candidate modalities for pseudopodia proteomics, silver staining is not practically suitable for the detection of pseudopodial proteins.\r\n\n\nIn 2D-DIGE, proteins in different samples are labeled with individual fluorescent dyes and resolved by 2D-PAGE; the separated proteins are detected by fluorescence using a laser scanner. As multiple protein samples are simultaneously separated in identical gels, gel-to-gel variations can be compensated. Moreover, protein spot intensities are measured as fluorescent signals with a wide linear dynamic range of 105; therefore, a reliable quantitative comparison between samples can be achieved. We developed a novel method to label laser-microdissected tissues using highly sensitive fluorescent dyes \\(CyDye DIGE Fluor saturation dyes) and reported that only 3000 cells were required to generate protein expression profiles<sup>24,25</sup>. In a previous study, 2D-DIGE was also applied to examination of pseudopodia proteins obtained through a conventional cotton-puff wiping procedure<sup>14</sup>; however, the sensitivity of a home-made fluorescent dye used in that study was equivalent to that of silver staining, and only highly abundant species such as heat shock and cytoskeletal proteins were detected. In our experiments, we used CyDye DIGE Fluor saturation dyes, which enabled the expression profiling using small amounts of pseudopodia proteins.\r\n\n\nIn our previous experiments, protein identification was achieved by mass spectrometry using high amounts of whole cell proteins separated in a preparative gel<sup>24</sup>. By using 2D-DIGE and a sensitive fluorescent dye, global protein profiling can be performed using only a few micrograms of protein; however, the protein amount in gel spots does not reach the sensitivity of mass spectrometry. Therefore, target protein spots are detected in the preparative gel using the image analysis software and recovered for protein identification. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3.3. Functional analysis of pseudopodia proteins using confocal imaging**\r\n\n\nTo investigate the functions of the identified proteins in pseudopodia formation, we developed a novel imaging system based on immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. In our method, the transient overexpression or silencing of the identified proteins were achieved by transfection with expression vectors or specific siRNA, respectively. The protein localization and the status of pseudopodia are monitored by confocal imaging. The effects of transfection on the pseudopodia formations are quantitatively evaluated by measuring the pseudopodia length and the number of protrusions, and pseudopodia functional activity was assessed based on cell motility and invasiveness<sup>20,26</sup>. The elongation of pseudopodia protrusions is an important step in cell movement and invasion<sup>27</sup>, and the cells with elongated protrusions may be potentially more invasive than those with shorter pseudopodia.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**4. Limitations of the pseudopodia proteomic** approach based on combination of excimer laser etching, 2D-DIGE, and confocal imaging\r\n\n\nTo isolate pseudopodia, we used a sophisticated and rather expensive medical device specifically developed for ophthalmic refractive surgery, which was approved by the relevant institutions. Although the device has demonstrated excellent performance in isolation of pseudopodia, its high cost dictates the necessity to develop a simple and less expensive device for basic experiments.\r\n\n\nAnother limitation of our novel approach is the chemoattractant-containing media. In our protocols, we used NIH3T3-conditioned medium, which induced MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and B16-F10 murine melanoma cells plated on fibronectin-coated porous membranes to sprout out the protrusions into the pores. However, this medium did not promote the formation of pseudopodia in SBC-3 and SBC-5 human small cell lung cancer cells or MSTO-211H human mesothelioma cells, indicating that cell-specific chemoattractants should be used.\r\n\n\nIn our previous study, approximately 100 unique pseudopodia proteins were identified using the combination of the excimer laser etching technique and 2D-DIGE20. However, they did not include some of the well-established pseudopodia proteins, such as integrin beta, indicating that the actual number of pseudopodia-specific proteins may be higher. In this study, we detected approximately 50 proteins with acidic isoelectric points. According to the genome information, acidic and basic proteins exist in the cell in approximately equal numbers. Assuming the same proportion among the pseudopodia proteins, we may be able to observe some 50 species in the alkaline range. Gorg et al. reported that the use of isoelectric focusing gels with a narrow isoelectric point range resulted in the detection of low-abundance proteins<sup>28</sup>. Fractionation of pseudopodia proteins prior to 2D-DIGE may be a potential solution to overcome this problem; however, possible protein loss during fractionation may occur. \r\n\n\nIn our method, the functions of pseudopodia proteins were evaluated by genetically regulating target protein expression and assessing the changes in pseudopodia behavior using confocal imaging. However, the length of pseudopodia does not fully reflect their functional activity. Our method can be considered as the first step of functional evaluation, and a multi-faceted approach may be required to better understand the regulatory effects of pseudopodial proteins<sup>16</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**5. Applications**\r\n\n\nThe combination of the excimer laser etching technique, 2D-DIGE, and confocal imaging is applicable to proteomic studies of membrane ventral protrusions, including pseudopodia and invadopodia, in any adherent cancer cell type. Proteins differentially expressed in membrane protrusions may contribute to understanding of the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, and our method will provide further understanding of the malignant cancer phenotype."

Culture the cells for two days at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\r\n\n\n4| Wash the cells on the porous membrane three times gently with D-PBS.\r\n\n\n5| Remove D-PBS using a pipette and cotton swab without touching the cells. You can now proceed to cell body ablation with the excimer laser using the following protocol.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Excimer laser etching**\r\n\n\n6| In a LASIK system, an argon fluoride \\(ArF) excimer laser \\(193 nm, 10 Hz) passes through laser pulse-shaper optics \\(a pattern mask, collimator lenses, and an image rotator) to be tuned in a Gaussian pattern for LASIK surgery as illustrated in Figure 2.\r\n\n\n7| Tune the pulse configuration in a flat pattern by aligning the lenses so that two adjacent laser pulses partially overlap. In this setting, the cumulative laser intensity is constant at any point in the irradiation area and the ablation pattern is horizontally flat within a circle 10-mm in diameter \\(Figure 2).\r\n\n\n8| Adjust the laser pulse energy to 10\u201314 mJ and the pulse number to 12 per scan.\r\n\n\n9| Immediately after absorbing D-PBS from the porous membrane, insert with a cotton swab, and place the insert on the irradiation stage of the tuned LASIK system.\r\n\n\n10| Focus the irradiation plane on the surface of the cell monolayer.\r\n\n\n11| Start laser scanning monitoring with a CCD camera with oblique illumination. \r\n\n\n12| Stop the laser when the light scattering due to cell bodies disappears \\(record the laser scan number.)\r\n\n\n13| Fix the irradiated membrane with formalin and stain it with hematoxylin and eosin. \r\n\n\n14| Examine the stained membrane for the remaining cell bodies using a light microscope. \r\n\n\n15| Find the minimal laser scan number that provides complete removal of cell bodies \\(18 to 24 scans are required.)\r\n\n\n16| Immediately after complete cell body removal, cut out the irradiated membrane area using a hollow leather punch \\(5 mm in diameter) and quickly freeze it in liquid nitrogen.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA schematic diagram of laser ablation and protein extraction is presented in Figure 2. In addition, a representative image of the excimer laser scanning of the cells cultured on the porous membrane is provided in Supplementary Video 1.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n17| Store the cut membrane at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.\r\n\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL The total protein concentration in the final sample is too low to be measured using conventional methods such as the Bradford or Lowry assays. Thus, we routinely extract proteins from 100 sheets punched out of the ablated porous membranes and analyze them in triplicate 2D gels. An average spot intensity of three gels is then calculated and spots are subjected to further analysis. Sitek et al. reported that 1000 cells were sufficient to generate a 2D image using our protocol\n24\n. Although the extracts from fewer membrane sheets could generate 2D images, the procedural protein loss is enhanced when the initial protein amount is decreased below a certain level. Although 100 sheets per three gels empirically generate a 2D image with an adequate number of protein spots, the amount of extracted protein can vary among cell types, and we recommend using more membranes if the number of protein spots detected on the 2D gel is less than expected.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Protein extraction** \r\n\n\n\u25cf Timing: day 3, 1 h\r\n\n\n18| Extract proteins from pseudopodia in the cut porous membrane \\(option A) and cell bodies \\(option B).\r\n\n\n\\(A) Extraction of pseudopodial proteins:\r\n\n\n   \\(i) Macerate 100 frozen membranes.\r\n\n\n   \\(ii) Rotate macerated membranes in lysis buffer at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min.\r\n\n\n   \\(iii) Centrifuge at > 10,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min to remove insoluble material.\r\n\n\n   \\(iv) Recover the supernatant and use it in protein expression studies.\r\n\n\n\\(B) Extraction of cell body proteins:\r\n\n\n   \\(i) Scrape 2-day MDA-MB-231 cell monolayers from the porous membrane.\r\n\n\n   \\(ii) Rotate the scraped cells in lysis buffer at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min.\r\n\n\n   \\(iii) Centrifuge at > 10,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min to remove insoluble material.\r\n\n\n   \\(iv) Recover the supernatant and use it in protein expression studies.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2D-DIGE**\r\n\n\n\u25cf Timing: days 3\u20137 \\(Figure 3)\r\n\n\nProtein separation by 2D-DIGE, handling of the target gel, and in-gel protein digestion are performed as previously described 29, except the following:\r\n\n\n**Sample preparation for 2D-DIGE:** label the proteins extracted from pseudopodia \\(option A) and cell bodies \\(internal control sample; option B) as described in REAGENT SETUP.

            "content": "The problems encountered during the procedure such as 2D images with unexpectedly small number of protein spots, low separation of protein spots, and distorted images can be attributed to technical issues with the excimer laser etching and 2D-DIGE. In the excimer laser etching, laser scanning counts should be adjusted according to the cell type and density. For the reproducibility of expression profiling, it is also critical to completely remove cell bodies. In 2D-DIGE, troubleshooting for technical problems such as poor quality of the 2D image can be found in the previous reports<sup>33,34</sup>. The first step in troubleshooting is to determine whether it is the excimer laser etching or 2D-DIGE that has caused the problem. For this purpose, we recommend using an adequate control sample for 2D-DIGE. We have described an established method of protein extraction from cultured cells to be used for 2D-DIGE, and this control protein sample will be helpful to identify the cause of the problem."

To improve myopia, hypermetropia, and astigmatism, the superficial anterior corneal tissue is reshaped by a topographically assisted excimer laser after the epithelium is flapped from the Bowman\u2019s layer. In LASIK, an argon fluoride excimer laser reshapes the superficial anterior corneal tissue in Gaussian fitting without damaging the underlying tissues. B. Pseudopodia isolation and protein extraction. Protein extraction from the membranes containing pseudopodial microprocesses. Cell culture on fibronectin-coated porous membrane positioned over the chemotactic factor-containing medium is shown. The excimer laser ablates the cells on the porous membrane; the laser scanning plane is adjusted to the surface of the porous membrane. The pulse energy and scanning cycles are optimized to completely remove cell bodies and leave pseudopodia intact in the membrane pores. Membranes are punched out after ablation and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The porous membrane before (left) and after (right) excimer laser ablation is shown.\r\n",

The proteins purified from pseudopodia and cell bodies are separated by 2D-DIGE, and protein spots are compared based on the relative intensity of fluorescence signals. Proteins spots with signals stronger in the pseudopodial than in the whole cell body fraction are analyzed by LC-MS/MS to identify the candidate pseudopodia-enriched molecules. B. Confirmation of pseudopodia-specific localization and functional analysis of pseudopodia-enriched proteins using immunocytochemical staining. The representative immunocytochemical staining of F-actin with phalloidin to identify pseudopodia and the target candidate protein are shown. In the functional analysis, the length of pseudopodial microprocesses is measured to evaluate the invasiveness/motility of cancer cells with different levels of target protein expression.",

Here, we present a novel approach to perform pseudopodia proteomics. Tumor cells growing on porous membranes extend pseudopodia into the membrane pores. In our method, cell bodies are removed by horizontal ablation at the basal cell surface with the excimer laser while pseudopodia are left in the membrane pores. For protein expression profiling, whole cell and pseudopodia proteins are extracted with a lysis buffer, labeled with highly sensitive fluorescent dyes, and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteins with unique expression patterns in pseudopodia are identified by mass spectrometry. The effects of the identified proteins on pseudopodia formation are evaluated by measuring the pseudopodia length in cancer cells with genetically modified expression of target proteins using confocal imaging. This protocol allows global identification of pseudopodia proteins and evaluation of their functional significance in pseudopodia formation within one month.",
