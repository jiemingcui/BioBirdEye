            "content": "It is widely accepted that confocal laser scanning microscopy \\(CLSM) and other derivative techniques \\(e.g. FRET) are currently the state-of-the-art image technologies in microscopy. Because of the top quality and high definition of cell images provided, CLSM is therefore used for many applications including immunocytochemical detection, nuclear or other organelle localization of target proteins, FRET or any other fluorophore-based technique for different purposes in which high resolution images of cells are required, even in living  cells and tissues<sup>1,2</sup>. Nonetheless in addition to its cell image capabilities, this powerful technique has opened a broad range of new image-related possibilities to solve biological questions<sup>3</sup>. Therefore confocal microscopy is a great tool in order to obtain three-dimensional object images using two-dimensional optical sectioning plus 3D reconstruction<sup>4</sup>. For this purpose, image processing software has evolved at such a high speed during the last few years that it has made possible to manage, combine and process digital images in a very short time.\r\n\n\nAccurate cell volume determination is extremely useful for many Cell Biology techniques, including morphometric studies, physiological studies<sup>5</sup> or estimation of intracellular concentration of substances<sup>6</sup>. Interestingly there are not many simple and straightforward methodological approaches for the estimation of volume especially in living cells. Furthermore many of those methods often requires very specific technology<sup>7</sup>, use of isotopes<sup>8</sup> or non-friendly software that requires a time-consuming, long-learning curve. This sometimes discourages users from employing such methods for morphometric analysis. As we suggest here, internalization of targeted drugs could be easily monitored and quantified using both a simple protocol for volume determination as well as parallel analytical methods for quantification of substances inside cells. Therefore combination of these powerful techniques, confocal microscopy and HPLC, which are available for most of laboratories, is the key for these types of pharmacokinetic studies.\r\n\n\nWith this goal in mind, the aim was to develop an easy protocol to obtain cell images for volume determination but maintaining them in their own growth media so osmotic pressure and therefore potential morphological changes are minimized. Consequently cell volume estimated under this paradigm is more realistic since cell manipulation is minimized. \r\n\n\n **ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF OUR METHOD**\r\n\n\nFlow cytometry can also be employed to determine with accuracy cell volume using fluorescent latex particles with a known diameter as standards<sup>9</sup>. Even though this method appears as a good choice in some cases, cells processed for flow cytometry are submitted to some handling prior to injection \\(i.e. centrifugation) which can alter the normal volume that they exhibit in cell culture plates, so real values may differ. Furthermore prior to flow cytometer analysis cells are commonly detached from substrate and centrifuged which always induces round shape morphology with changes in real cell volume. However, the method we propose here, using CLSM combined with 3D image processing software and cell cultures, is very simple and fast for measuring geometric parameters of cells and would open new possibilities of knowledge."

Add 5.0 ml of trypsin-EDTA to each plate and incubate at room temperature for 4 min. Add 5.0 ml of RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 25 mM HEPES cell culture medium and transfer cell suspension into a 15 ml conical tube.\r\n\n\n2\u2502 Pellet suspended cells in 15 ml conical tubes using a centrifuge for 5 min at 500g. Re-suspend each cell pellet in 2-3 ml of media and perform cell counts.\r\n\n\n3\u2502 Place a coverslip inside culture plates \\(6 well-plate) with sterilized tweezers. \r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP. It is very important that all coverslips used for growing cells must be carefully handled to avoid contamination. Caution should also be taken when place the growing side \\(usually only one side is treated for cell attachment) of the coverslip correctly.\r\n\n\n4\u2502 Complete media is then added to culture plates \\(2 ml) without dropping media over the coverslips to ensure that cells keep attached to the surface. \r\n\n\n5\u2502 Cells are seeded at the appropriate final density \\(50,000 cells/ml but may vary depending on cell type/size). After adding cells, plates are slowly shaken to homogenize cell distribution. \r\n\n\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**\r\n\n\n6\u2502 Cells were left growing for 48 hours inside cell incubator.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Staining with fluorescence molecule- TIMING 20 minutes**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7\u2502 Add 2 ml of fresh RPMI medium with 0.2% FBS in new 6 well plates. Three of the wells are used for washing \\(PBS-glucose) while the other can be used employed for staining. \r\n\n\n8\u2502 Add 20 \u00b5l of AO solution to RPMI medium of three plates and shake to homogenize.\r\n\n\n9\u2502 Using sterilized tweezers place each one of the coverslips containing cells in one of the wells with washing solution for 1 minute and then take coverslips into wells for staining during 10 minutes at RT.\r\n\n\n10\u2502 After this time pipet 100 \u00b5l of RPMI medium with 0.2% FBS on a clean slide and then place coverslips with cells over medium upside-down. Then mounting medium is used as adhesive, using it only in the external limits of coverslip to avoid auto-fluorescence.\r\n\n\n11\u2502 Immediately after mounting place slide with one drop of immersion oil under the confocal microscopy. \r\n\n\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**\r\n\n\nPOINT WITHOUT PAUSE- It is strongly required to start collecting images from confocal microscope immediately after mounting. Therefore we do recommend mounting slides in the same room where confocal analysis is done.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Capturing images with confocal microscopy**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n12\u2502 Run the software with the setting up indicated above \\(see equipment setup).\r\n\n\n13\u2502Search area of interest to include as many individual cells as possible.\r\n\n\n14\u2502 Indicate the coordinates to make the slices for analyzing.\r\n\n\n15\u2502 Establish 1 \u00b5m depth slices and store images for further processing\r\n\n\n16\u2502 To ensure reproducibility, repeat the process described in steps 12-14 until a number over 100 cells is reached. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Image data preparation**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n17\u2502 Run the \u2018Imaris\u2019 program for processing images.\r\n\n\n18\u2502 In the menu \u2018File\u2019, select \u2018Open\u2019 and click in the first section image, so the software will open all section images taken.\r\n\n\n19\u2502 In the new window that pops-up, select \u2018volume\u2019, \u2018surface\u2019 and then click on the \\`blend\u2019 button . In the keyboard press \u2018Ctrl+D\u2019 and a new window pops-up. In this new window select \u201cauto blend\u201d and then close this window.\r\n\n\n20\u2502 Now, select \u2018surface\u2019 and in the flag of \u2018create\u2019 press two times blue bottom of play.\r\n\n\n21\u2502 In this step it is possible to modify the absolute intensity but we rather recommend to click the \u2018automatic mode\u2019 so we minimize manipulation of images.\r\n\n\n22\u2502 Click again on the \u2018play\u2019 button and a new window will pops-up filled with several lines corresponding to the different cell volumes. You must move the threshold line up in order to eliminate those objects that correspond to incomplete cells with too low volumes or \u201ccut-off\u201d cells on both sides of image selected. Then click again on the blue button to finish these steps.\r\n\n\n23\u2502 Select tab labeled as \u2018pencil\u2019 and click on \u2018select\u2019 for selecting all those incomplete cells that were impossible to eliminate in the previous step. For eliminating those cells just select them and then \u2018delete\u2019. \r\n\n\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**\r\n\n\n24\u2502 When working with specific cell types, many of them grow either in clusters or they form groups in which many of the cells remain bound one to each other. When this happens, it is necessary to cut between two or more cells. However it is quite easy to identify the binding area because usually it appears as a \u201cvalley\u201d just between adjacent cells thus indicating the joining point. Consequently user has to choose these points and make the appropriate cuttings for obtaining accurate measurements.\r\n\n\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**\r\n\n\n25\u2502 Once user has completed this part of the software image processing of all cells, all data have been acquired by computer. To obtain data, select tab labeled as \u2018statistic\u2019 and then \u2018detailed\u2019 and choose the desired parameter such as \u2018volume\u2019, \u2018surface\u2019 or \u2018sphericity\u2019. A table containing data will then appear. Just click on any of the data displayed and then the corresponding cell image will appear, so user can easily correlate any of the data with the cellular source.\r\n\n\n26\u2502 Data can be easily exported to an excel datasheet by selecting in the same tab the \u2018save\u2019 command. A new window will then appear with the corresponding data.\r\n\n\n27\u2502**OPTIONAL STEP**; It is recommended to save a copy of image using the \u2018snapshot\u2019 command. This will save pictures as a \u2018tiff\u2019 file which can be further used under any other program for treating images \\(i.e. Photoshop, Paint Shop, etc\u2026). This would allow users to compare and correlate data with cells using other programs with a more intuitive interface."

            "content": "**TROUBLESHOOTING**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPROBLEM: Step 5 and 24-Density of cultured cells. Too many/few cells appear at final magnification.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: The density of cells is crucial at this point since the main objective is the real morphology of cells and therefore the treatment of images coming from real cells. To do so it is highly recommended to seed a few cells initially so image handling is easier when cell density is much below confluence. If cell density is near 90-100% it becomes difficult to isolate cells without cutting joints between cells. Otherwise it would be time consuming and not easy to obtain clean images and reproducibility is also lower.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPROBLEM: Step 11-Speed too low while manipulating coverslips and confocal microscopy.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: At this step when confocal microscopy is ready if operator is quick enough it is then feasible to scan more than five fields in the same coverslip in a minimum time. Otherwise, if all these steps are performed too slowly, only 2-3 fields can be analyzed and more coverslip are required to scan to obtain optimal results. The stopping point is indicated by the presence of bubbles or any other visual artifact, as this is an indicator that cells are not kept under normal conditions.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPROBLEM: Step 14 and 23-Height of cells out of range.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: When choosing low and high limits in z-axis for cell screening \\(step 14), some of the cells are placed too up or down and consequently the whole cell is not contained in the gap. In these cases cells should not be considered for quantifying and operator must eliminate them manually at step 23. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPROBLEM: Step 17 to 27-Treatment of images1.\r\n\n\nSOLUTION: Although it might be deduced that these steps depend highly on operator, following a few indications ensures that the whole process becomes more reproducible. By comparing two independent observers here we demonstrate that differences obtained in cells parameters after the whole process is completed are below 1%. To this aim it is very important that all steps are set in automatic mode. If operator changes intensity manually in the software, care should be taken so intensity must be changed accordingly for all the measurements, otherwise process is subjective. On the contrary, setting mode to \u2018automatic\u2019, measurements are performed equally in all the cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAll these steps are further explained in a tutorial video shown as supplementary material video 1."

            "content": "**ANTICIPATED RESULTS**\r\n\n\nFor several researchers it may be very important to know exactly the intracellular concentrations of exogenous and endogenous compounds, proteins, DNA, RNA or any others molecules of interest. Currently there are several analytical applications for estimating the presence and the amount of virtually any molecule inside cells<sup>11</sup> . On the contrary, scientists do not have simple tools to estimate cell volume. To fill this gap, the primordial objective in this work was to create an easy, reproducible and accurate method to calculate volume of cells. Thus, in combination with HPLC or any other analytical method, the protocol shown here will allow estimation of intracellular concentration of molecules. Results with data of volumes from different cell types using the protocol reported here are shown in table 1.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAs it can be seen in table 1, it is remarkable the differences in cell volumes measured in different cell types. In some cases, differences of volume can be observed at microscopy level because cell diameter is the major source of variation. However, in other cell types diameter do not vary significantly and differences observed are rather due to cell height so our protocol would be especially useful for the latter. Protocol is easy to perform with most cells. Other cell types like murine macrophages RAW 264.7 cells offer particular difficulties. RAW 264.7 macrophages are easily activated by LPS or other factors including high cell density. When cells are activated they change dramatically in morphology which can be easily followed up under microscope. This particular feature was also identified using our method as it can be seen in table 2. In this case we observed that when RAW 264.7 cells were cultured at a density near 70%  a high error in cell volume was noticed. This was due to both morphology and volume changes. When those \u201cactivated\u201d cells are identified and processed apart \\(table 2, see RAWc), the volume of the rest cells \\(RAW<sup>b</sup> ) are virtually the same that in other tests \\(see table 1 for comparing). Furthermore with this data we can assure that morphology changes can be identified and even quantified. \r\n\n\nFurthermore, although we have mainly emphasized the use of this method for cell volume determination, it is possible to quantify other geometric parameters such as surface area or sphericity. In the latter case, sphericity, it can be used for quantifying morphological changes in which exogenous stimuli trigger changes in morphology or for quantifying differences of morphology between cell types. Figure 3 shows an example of how the protocol may illustrate and quantify the differences in cell morphology by comparing the 3D image reconstruction. For this purpose, we have provided videos 2, 3, 4 and 5 as supplementary material, where differences in cell morphology between cell types can be observed. Furthermore video 6 shows a 360\u00b0 rotation of PC3 cell around other cells.\r\n\n\nAll data and supplementary material shown here demonstrates that the protocol shown here is a simple, fast and accurate tool for measuring different cell parameters in several cell types using a common CLSM which is accessible to most laboratories. More over in combination with other techniques available for many researchers, intracellular concentration of substances or any other comparative analysis of morphological changes can be easily performed. Currently many therapeutic approaches of how new drugs can be useful either in cancer, neurodegeneration or many other pathologies usually require some knowledge about how these substances enter into cells/tissues and what is the real concentration reached in those tagets. In fact the intracellular concentration truly discriminates between successful new drugs and the rest. However most researchers do not approach the possibility of establishing intracellular concentration of molecules because of the intrinsic difficulties in obtaining cell volume measurements. Therefore, the method proposed here may fill this gap and offers an easy and inexpensive way to overcome those difficulties."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "The protocol reported here describes a simple, easy, fast and reproducible method aimed to know the geometric parameters of living cells based on confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with 3D reconstruction software. Briefly, the method is based on intrinsic fluorescence properties of acridine orange \\(AO), a molecule taken up by living adherent cells. Dual binding of AO to either DNA or RNA allows complete staining. When combined with confocal microscopy, 3D software can be used for in vivo living cell reconstruction. Beside the purpose that we intend here, a fast and easy system for cell volume determination, the protocol is an easy approach to study changes in morphology during cellular processes such as cell differentiation. Novel therapeutic approaches would require some knowledge about how these drugs enter into cells/tissues. For this purpose fast and accurate in vivo cell volume determinations such as the method reported here, in combination with analytical methods, would allow estimating intracellular concentrations of compounds and might be further employed for finding out whether any new drug can reach the effective concentration inside its cellular target. Furthermore this protocol with minimal adjustments will permit the determination of morphometric parameters in vivo in different types of adherent cells.",
