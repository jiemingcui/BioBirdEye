            "content": "NMR spectroscopy is the most useful tool for determining the structure of an unknown organic molecule. By coupling this approach with other analytical techniques \\(e.g. mass spectrometry) the structure of an unknown organic molecule can be elucidated. However, molecules of greater complexity continue to be isolated and/or prepared, and their associated analytical data are increasingly convoluted. Consequently, the assigned structures of these newly isolated compounds are sometimes incorrect, which leads to years of misguided effort \u201cchasing molecules that were never there\u201d <sup>1</sup>. Modern computational chemistry software packages \\(e.g., Spartan<sup>2,3</sup>, Gaussian 09<sup>4</sup>, and Jaguar<sup>5,6</sup>) have enabled the routine use of density functional theory \\(DFT) calculations for predicting spectroscopic properties of organic molecules. For example, one of us recently reported a protocol that described an approach using Gaussian 09 to compute NMR data for molecules that adopt conformational isomers<sup>7</sup>. An important, early part of this protocol required the use of the software application, MacroModel<sup>8</sup> \\(part of the Schr\u00f6dinger suite) to carry out a stochastic conformational search using the OPLS molecular mechanics force field. For each structure resulting from this conformational search, free energies and NMR shielding tensors were calculated. Using the free energy data, a Boltzmann factor was determined for each conformer, which was, in turn, converted into the relative mole fraction. The computed NMR data are averaged \\(using the mole fraction of each conformation), referenced, and scaled to generate a set of Boltzmann-weighted average chemical shifts. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDue to the widespread use of Spartan for molecular mechanics calculations, we have prepared an addendum to this protocol that utilizes the structures resulting from a Spartan _Conformer Distribution_ calculation. As discussed in our original protocol,<sup>7</sup> molecules of increasing complexity are often accompanied by many conformational isomers. We have developed a Python script \\(e.g., \u201cwrite-g09-inputs-sdf.py\u201d) that generates two Gaussian 09 input files for each structure resulting from the conformational search. For convenience, we have provided an additional script \\(e.g., \u201cwrite-g03-inputs-sdf.py\u201d) that prepares Gaussian 03 input files. These input files include an _\u201c-opt_freq\u201d_ file for determining the optimal geometry and free energy along with an _\u201c-nmr\u201d_ file for calculating NMR shielding tensor data. The Python script expedites the DFT computations by greatly simplifying the preparation of the Gaussian input files. More specifically, the script extracts structural information from a \u201c.sdf\u201d file generated in Spartan, and the coordinates of each conformation are written into the Gaussian input files. The \u201c.sdf\u201d file type is routinely used for storing molecular information for multiple structures and can be produced by myriad software applications. The script provided in this protocol will be useful for writing Gaussian input files from \u201c.sdf\u201d files prepared in other chemistry software applications."

The resulting input files are necessary for computing optimum geometries, relative conformer energies, and NMR shielding tensors using Gaussian. Using the conformational search feature within Spartan\u201914, an ensemble of conformational isomers was obtained. To convert the structures into a format that is readable by Gaussian 09, the conformers were first exported to a single \u201c.sdf\u201d file. A Python script was used to \\(i) read the structural information of each conformer within the \u201c.sdf\u201d file and \\(ii) write the corresponding atomic coordinates into a series Gaussian 09 input files. This approach decreases the amount of active effort required to compute NMR chemical shifts of a structure that populates an ensemble of conformers.",
