            "content": "This protocol describes a procedure for preparation of Co/Al-coordinated conjugated microporous polymer \\(Co-CMP and Al-CMP). The protocol requires four components: Co\\(OAc)2, Al\\(OEt)3, 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene and Salen \\[\\(R,R)-N\u2019N\u2019-bis\\(5-bromo-3-tert-butyl-salicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediaminate].  Co-CMP was synthesised via two steps as follows: First, the Salen-Co-OAc was synthesised by complexation reaction of Co\\(OAc)2 and Salen; Second, the Co-CMP was prepared by Pd\\(0)-catalysed cross-coupling of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene with Salen-Co-OAc. Al-CMP was synthesised via two steps as follows: We first prepared a CMP by Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling of Salen and 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene in the presence of Pd\\(0) as a catalyst. The precursor CMP was treated with Al\\(OEt)3 in toluene under reflux to obtain the polymer Al-CMP."

            "content": "A typical example of the synthesis Co-CMP is given below:\r\n\n\n1. Synthesis of 5-bromo-3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.\n2\nA solution of Br2 \\(0.44 ml, 8.45 mmol) in CH3COOH \\(2 ml) was added dropwise at room temperature over 30 min to a solution of 3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde \\(1.50 g, 8.41 mmol) in CH3COOH \\(5 ml). After 2 hours, the reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 \\(50 ml) and washed with water \\(20 ml), saturated aqueous Na2S2O5 \\(20 ml), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 \\(10 ml), and saturated sodium chloride \\(20 ml). The organic phase was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvents were evaporated, leaving the target compound as a yellow solid. The crude product was further purified through crystallisation from CH3OH \\(10 ml) on an analytically pure sample.\r\n\n\n2. Synthesis of Salen.\n1\nA solution of \\(R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane \\(0.48 ml, 4 mmol) in ethanol \\(60 ml) was placed in a three-neck flask tube \\(250 ml) maintained under vacuum. The solution was stirred for 30 minutes under an argon atmosphere at ambient temperature. After the reaction solution was added to 80\u00b0C, the solution of 5-bromo-3-tert-butyl-salicylidene \\[\\(2.056 g, 8 mmol) 5-bromo-3-tert-butyl- salicylidene dissolved in 10 ml THF] was slowly added to the reaction solution over 30 minutes. The mixture solution was then stirred for 4-5 hours at 80\u00b0C, cooled to room temperature and combined with 60 ml of water, after which it was continually stirred at ambient temperature. The insoluble precipitate was filtered and dissolved in ether, and this solution was washed 2-3 times with saturated sodium chloride solution and water to remove any unreacted residues. Removing the solvent yielded a yellow powder, which was dried in a vacuum for 24 hours at 50 \u00b0C \\(yield: 1.91 g, 80.2%).\r\n\n\n3. Synthesis of Salen-Co \\(II).\n1\nA solution of Co\\(OAc)2 \\(170 mg, 0.96 mmol) in CH3OH \\(10 ml) was added to a solution of Salen \\(400 mg, 0.675 mol) in toluene \\(10 ml) under argon with a syringe, resulting in a dark red precipitate. The reaction mixture was heated to 80-85\u00b0C and stirred for 5-6 hours, then cooled down to room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 \\(80 ml) and passed through a Celite pad to remove the excess Co\\(OAc)2. Removing the solvent of the filtrate yielded a dark red power \\(yield: 390 mg, 89.1%).\r\n\n\n5. Synthesis of Salen-Co-OAc.\n1\nAcetic acid \\(0.35 ml) was added to a solution of Salen-Co\\(II) \\(390 mg, 0.6 mmol) in toluene \\(6 ml) and CH2Cl2 \\(18 ml). The solution quickly changed from red to brown. After 5-6 hours, all solvents and excess acetic acid were removed, and the residue was dried in a vacuum for 24 hours at 70\u00b0C, yielding a brown powder. \r\n\n\n6. Synthesis of Co-CMP. \r\n  1,3,5-triethynylbenzene \\(180 mg, 1.2 mmol), Salen-Co-OAc \\(400 mg, 0.6 mmol), tetrakis- \\(triphenylphosphine)palladium\\(0) \\(100 mg) and CuI \\(50 mg) were dissolved in a mixture of toluene \\(15 ml) and triethylamine \\(6 ml). The reaction mixture was heated to 40 \u00b0C and stirred for 1 hour under an argon atmosphere \\(to exclude oxygen and prevent any homocoupling of the alkyne monomers). Next, the reaction mixture was heated to 80 \u00b0C, stirred for 72 hours, then cooled to room temperature. The insoluble precipitated polymer was filtered and washed four times with dichloromethane, methanol, water, and acetone to remove any unreacted monomers or catalyst residues. Further purification of the polymer was carried out by Soxhlet extraction with methanol and dichloromethane \\(volume ratio = 1:1) for 48 hours. The product was dried in a vacuum for 24 hours at 70 \u00b0C and isolated as a brown powder \\(yield: 460 mg, 79.3%).\r\n\n\nA typical example of the synthesis Al-CMP is given below:\r\n\n\n1. Synthesis of 5-bromo-3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.\n2\nsame as above\r\n\n\n2. Synthesis of Salen.\n1\nsame as above\r\n\n\n3. Synthesis of CMP. \r\n  1,3,5-triethynylbenzene \\(300 mg, 2 mmol), Salen \\(296 mg, 0.5 mmol), tetrakis-\\(triphenyl phosphine)palladium\\(0) \\(120 mg) and CuI \\(80 mg) were dissolved in a mixture of toluene \\(10 mL) and Et3N \\(5 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to 40 \u00b0C and stirred for 1 hour under an argon atmosphere \\(to exclude oxygen and prevent any homocoupling of the alkyne monomers). Next, the reaction mixture was heated to 85\u00b0C, stirred for 72 hours, then cooled to room temperature. The insoluble precipitated polymer was filtered and washed four times with dichloromethane, methanol, water, and acetone to remove any unreacted monomers or catalyst residues. Further purification of the polymer was carried out by Soxhlet extraction with water, dichloromethane, acetone and methanol \\(volume ratio = 1:1:1:1) for 24 hours. The product was dried in a vacuum for 24 hours at 70 \u00b0C and isolated as a brown powder \\(yield: 481 mg, 80.8%).\r\n\n\n4. Synthesis of Al-CMP.\r\n  CMP \\(150 mg) was added to a solution of Al\\(OEt)3 \\(300 mg) in 30 ml toluene, and the suspension was then refluxed for 24 hours. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the insoluble precipitated network polymer was filtered and washed four times with dichloromethane, water, methanol, and acetone to remove the unreacted aluminium complex. Further purification of the polymer was carried out using a Soxhlet extraction with water, acetone, dichloromethane and methanol for 24 h. The product was then dried under vacuum for 24 hours at 70 \u00b0C to yield 280 mg of brown powder \\(Al-CMP) \\(yield: 280 mg, 62.2%)."
