Cell-based SICyLIA application**\r\n\n\n\\(1) Plate cells to be compared \\(i.e. GEMM-derived wild-type and knock-out cells) in 10 cm dishes in regular medium and grow overnight at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\n. Use a density that achieves ==\n== 80% confluence after ==\n== 20 hrs \\(i.e. 1 million cells). \r\n\n\n\\(2) Pre-chill bench top centrifuge to 4 \u00b0C\r\n\n\n\\(3) Prepare lysis buffer 1 \\(100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 4% SDS) and immediately before cell lysis and protein extraction, add light or heavy iodoacetamide \\(IAM) to lysis buffer 1 to achieve 55 mM IAM solutions.\r\n\n\n\u2192 Note: iodoacetamide is unstable and light sensitive, so solutions are best made fresh and kept in the dark until use. \r\n\n\n\\(4) Remove medium and wash cell monolayers twice with pre-chilled PBS \\(4 \u00b0C) ensuring to aspirate PBS thoroughly.\r\n\n\n\\(5) Add 500 \u00b5l lysis buffer 1 with IAM per dish and immediately scrape cells using a cell lifter.\r\n\n\n\\(6) Collect lysates in Eppendorf tubes.\r\n\n\n\\(7) Sonicate lysates for 4 x 5 s to shear DNA/RNA.\r\n\n\n\u2192 Note: heavy IAM \\(\n13\nC\n2\nD\n2\nH\n2\nINO) can be affected by hydrogen-deuterium exchange, which is exacerbated at high pH and temperature. This has been minimised in our protocol through optimisation of pH and temperature at all steps. Here, it is important to use ice during sonication to ensure samples do not heat up, yet prevent the SDS buffer from precipitating on ice over time. Clean sonicator thoroughly with 70% EtOH between samples to prevent cross-contamination. \r\n\n\n\\(8) Centrifuge lysates at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at RT.\r\n\n\n\\(9) Transfer supernatants to new Eppendorf tubes and incubate in a bench top shaker at 1400 rpm for 1 h in the dark at room temperature \\(RT).\r\n\n\n\\(10) Determine protein concentration of samples using bicinchoninic acid \\(BCA) assay or equivalent. \r\n\n\n\\(11) Store samples in the freezer \\(-80 \u00b0C) until further processing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2. Tissue-based SICyLIA application**\r\n\n\n_Note: this procedure was optimised for the analysis of mouse kidney tissues. Tissue resection and homogenisation strategy suitable for the tissue type under study may need to be optimised._ \r\n\n\n\\(1) Pre-chill plastic or glass dishes, scalpel, and forceps on dry ice.\r\n\n\n\\(2) Pre-chill Precellys24 bead-based homogeniser \\(Bertin Instruments, or equivalent).\r\n\n\n\\(3) Prepare lysis buffer 1 and immediately before tissue homogenisation, add light or heavy IAM to lysis buffer 1 to achieve 55 mM IAM solutions.\r\n\n\n\u2192 Note: iodoacetamide is unstable and light sensitive, so solutions are best made fresh and kept in the dark until use. \r\n\n\n\\(4) Prepare homogenisation tubes by adding 800 \u00b5l lysis buffer 1 with IAM to the ceramic beads. \r\n\n\n\\(5) Sacrifice mice by cervical dislocation. \r\n\n\n\u2192 Note: this is preferred over CO\n2\ninhalation, as this can induce tissue hypoxia and influence cellular redox status. \r\n\n\n\\(6) Excise kidneys, place in plastic tubes, and snap freeze tubes in liquid nitrogen. \r\n\n\n\\(7) Once frozen, place kidneys on pre-chilled plastic or glass dishes on dry ice and excise representative samples.\r\n\n\n\u2192 Note: ensure tissue does not defrost at any stage of the procedure until homogenisation to preserve cellular redox status.   \r\n\n\n\\(8) Add frozen tissue slices to homogenisation tubes with lysis buffer, and immediately homogenise for 3\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009s at 5000\u2009rpm.\r\n\n\n\\(9) Centrifuge lysates at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at RT.\r\n\n\n\\(10) Transfer supernatants to new Eppendorf tubes and incubate in a bench top shaker at 1400 rpm for 1 h in the dark at RT.\r\n\n\n\\(11) Determine protein concentration of samples using bicinchoninic acid \\(BCA) assay or equivalent.\r\n\n\n\\(12) Store samples in the freezer \\(-80 \u00b0C) until further processing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Part 2. Reduce/alkylate and proteome digestion** \r\n\n\n\\(1) Pre-chill bench top shaker and centrifuge to 4 \u00b0C\r\n\n\n\\(2) Thaw samples by incubating in a bench top shaker at RT until homogenously mixed and combine volumes equivalent to 150 \u00b5g of protein from the heavy and light labelled samples for SICyLIA analysis. \r\n\n\n\u2192 Note: use label-swap replication: heavy IAM-labelled wild-type replicate 1 with light IAM-labelled knock-out replicate 1 forms forward replicate 1; light IAM-labelled wild-type replicate 2 with heavy IAM-labelled knock-out replicate 2 forms reverse replicate 1, etc.\r\n\n\n\\(3) Transfer additional volumes equivalent to 150 \u00b5g of protein of all samples for dimethyl labelling for proteome normalisation.\r\n\n\n\u2192 Note: keep these samples separate; they are not combined until after dimethyl labelling\r\n\n\n\\(4) Bring the total volume of all samples to 300 \u00b5l by adding ammonium bicarbonate \\(Ambic, 0.1 M stock solution in water, pH 7.0).\r\n\n\n\\(5) Add dithiothreitol \\(DTT) to all samples to a final concentration of 71 mM \\(1 M stock solution in water, freshly made). \r\n\n\n\\(6) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm for 1 h at RT or 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\\(7) Bring the volume to 650 \u00b5l by adding Ambic.\r\n\n\n\\(8) Add N-ethylmaleimide \\(NEM) to all samples to a final concentration of 90 mM \\(0.2 M stock solution in water, freshly made).\r\n\n\n\\(9) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm for 1 h at RT.\r\n\n\n\\(10) Add TCA to all samples to a final concentration of 25% w/v \\(100% stock solution) in water to precipitate proteins.\r\n\n\n\\(11) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 300 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n\n\n\\(12) Centrifuge samples at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\\(13) Carefully remove supernatants and add 1 ml of TCA \\(10% stock solution) to protein pellets.\r\n\n\n\\(14) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 300 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. \r\n\n\n\\(15) Centrifuge samples at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\\(16) Wash pellets with water until pH = 7.0 \\(typically 4-5 washes required).\r\n\n\n\\(17) After last wash, centrifuge samples at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\\(18) Remove supernatants and re-suspend protein pellets in 50 \u00b5l Urea buffer \\(8 M stock solution in water).\r\n\n\n\\(19) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm for 15 min at RT.\r\n\n\n\\(20) Add 150 \u00b5l Ambic and vortex samples.\r\n\n\n\\(21) Add Lys-C \\(ratio 1:33 enzyme:protein) and incubate in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm for 1 hour at RT.\r\n\n\n\\(22) Bring volume to 500 \u00b5l with Ambic \\(pH 7.0) and vortex samples.\r\n\n\n\\(23) Add Trypsin \\(ratio 1:25 enzyme:protein) and incubate overnight in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm at RT.\r\n\n\n\u2192 Note: proteome digestion is usually carried out at higher pH and temperature to allow the enzymes to work optimally, but this can also promote hydrogen-deuterium exchange on heavy IAM. We established that overnight digestion at RT and pH 7.0 does not compromise efficiency as it had minimal effects on the miscleavage rate, while minimising hydrogen-deuterium exchange.\r\n\n\n\\(24) Next morning, acidify samples with trifluoroacetic acid \\(TFA, 50% stock solution in water) to a final concentration of 5%.\r\n\n\n\\(25) Forward/reverse mixed SICyLIA samples can now be stored at -80 \u00b0C until fractionation \\(Part 4). Proceed with the samples intended for proteome normalisation to Part 3.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n**Part 3. Dimethyl labelling for proteome normalisation**\r\n\n\n_We followed the on-column protocol described by Boersema and colleagues \\[1]._\r\n\n\n\\(1) Wash the SepPak columns using 100% acetonitrile, 2 x 1 ml.\r\n\n\n\\(2) Equilibrate the columns using RP buffer A, 4 x 1 ml.\r\n\n\n\\(3) Load the samples onto their respective columns.\r\n\n\n\\(4) Wash the columns using RP buffer A, 2 x 1ml.\r\n\n\n\\(5) Label peptides with light and heavy formaldehyde/cyanoborohydride solutions, using 5 x 1 ml each.\r\n\n\n\\(6) Wash the columns using RP buffer A, 2 x 1ml.\r\n\n\n\\(7) Elute and collect labelled samples using 500 \u00b5l RP buffer B.\r\n\n\n\\(8) Further elute and collect labelled samples using elution buffer 1 \\(500 \u00b5l acetonitrile with 2.5% TFA).\r\n\n\n\\(9) Mix the heavy and light labelled samples using the same label-swap replication approach as for SICyLIA samples \\(i.e. heavy dimethylated wild-type replicate 1 with light dimethylated knock-out replicate 1 forms forward replicate 1; light dimethylated labelled wild-type replicate 2 with heavy dimethylated knock-out replicate 2 forms reverse replicate 1, etc.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Part 4. Off-line reverse phase HPLC fractionation**\r\n\n\n\\(1) Reduce all sample volumes to 300 \u00b5l using vacuum centrifugation to remove ACN and TFA.\r\n\n\n\\(2) Bring the volume up to 500 \u00b5l per sample to match the injection loop volume, using HPLC solvent A.\r\n\n\n\\(3) Equilibrate the C18 column \\(150\u2009\u00d7\u20092.1\u2009mm i.d. - Kinetex EVO \\(5\u2009\u00b5m, 100\u2009\u00c5)) using 4% HPLC solvent B. \r\n\n\n\\(4) Inject samples \\(500 \u00b5l) manually through a Rheodyne valve onto the RP-HPLC column. \r\n\n\n\\(5) Apply a two-step gradient at a flow-rate of 200\u2009\u00b5l/min \\(from 4\u201327% B in 36\u2009min, then from 27\u201348% B in 8\u2009min) followed by a 5\u2009min washing step at 80% solvent B and a 10\u2009min re-equilibration step, for a total run time of 65\u2009min. \r\n\n\n\\(6) Monitor column eluate at 220 and 280\u2009nm and collect fractions using a Foxy Jr. FC144 fraction collector \\(Dionex). Collection was allowed from 9 to 54\u2009min for 90\u2009s per vial \\(300\u2009\u00b5l) for a total of 30 fractions. The first 4 and the last 5 fractions were pooled resulting in 21 fractions in total.\r\n\n\n\\(7) Dry the fractions to completion using vacuum centrifugation and store at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Part 5. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis**\r\n\n\n\\(1) Reconstitute the dried fractionated tryptic digests in 10 \u00b5l of MS solvent A \\(water, 0.1% formic acid).\r\n\n\n\\(2) Separate samples by nanoscale C18 reverse-phase liquid chromatography using an EASY-nLC II 1200 \\(Thermo Scientific) \r\n\n\n\\(3) Elute using a binary gradient with MS solvent A \\(2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water) and MS solvent B \\(80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water) at a flow rate of 300\u2009nl/min using different gradients, which were optimised for three sets of fractions: 1\u20137, 8\u201315, and 16\u201321. For all gradients, use 20\u2009min for step one and 7\u2009min for step two. Change the percentage of MS solvent B \\(%B) as follows: For F1-7, %B was 2 at the start, 20 at step one, and 39 at step two. For F8-14, %B was 4 at the start, 23 at step one, and 43 at step two. For F15-21, %B was 6 at the start, 28 at step one, and 48 at step two. Follow all gradients by a washing step \\(100% B) for 10\u2009min followed by a 5\u2009min re-equilibration step \\(5%), for a total run time of 40\u2009min.\r\n\n\n\\(5) Load samples with 8\u2009\u00b5l of MS solvent A into a 20\u2009cm fused silica emitter \\(New Objective) packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ, 1.9\u2009\u03bcm resin \\(Dr Maisch GmbH). Keep the packed emitter at 35\u2009\u00b0C using a column oven \\(Sonation) integrated into the nanoelectrospray ion source \\(Thermo Scientific). Eluting peptides are electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer \\(Q-Exactive HF, Thermo Scientific) using a nanoelectrospray ion source \\(Thermo Scientific). An Active Background Ion Reduction Device is used to decrease air contaminants signal level.  \r\n\n\n_Note on conditions:_ Use the following ionisation conditions: spray voltage 2.1\u2009kV, ion transfer tube temperature 250\u2009\u00b0C. Carry out acquisition in positive ion mode using data dependent acquisition; acquire a full scan \\(FT-MS) over mass range of 375\u20131400 m/z at 60,000 resolution at 200 m/z, with a target value of 3,000,000 ions for a maximum injection time of 20\u2009ms. Perform higher energy collisional dissociation fragmentation on the 15 most intense ions, for a maximum injection time of 50\u2009ms, or a target value of 50,000 ions. Select multiply charged ions having intensity greater than 12,000 counts through a 1.5 m/z window and fragment using a normalised collision energy of 27. Dynamically exclude former target ions selected for MS/MS for 25\u2009s.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Part 5. Data analysis** \r\n\n\n_We used MaxQuant version 1.5.5.1 \\[2] and searched with Andromeda search engine \\[3]. The default parameters were used with modifications as specified below._ \r\n\n\n**1.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Reactive oxygen species \\(ROS) are increasingly recognised as important signalling molecules that act through the oxidation of protein cysteine residues. Comprehensive identification of redox-regulated proteins and pathways is crucial to understand ROS-mediated events. Identifying cysteine oxidation on a whole-proteome scale remains a technical challenge due to the low abundance of oxidised thiols. Redox proteomics techniques therefore use multistep enrichment protocols, but these have inherent limitations and inform only on the enriched proteome. We developed stable isotope cysteine labelling with iodoacetamide \\(SICyLIA), a simple, unbiased, and robust mass spectrometry-based workflow for thiol oxidation analysis. SICyLIA does not require enrichment steps and achieves unbiased proteome-wide sensitivity. We applied SICyLIA to diverse cellular models and primary tissues and generated the most in-depth thiol oxidation profiles to date. Our results demonstrate that acute and chronic oxidative stress causes oxidation of distinct metabolic proteins, indicating that cysteine oxidation plays a key role in the metabolic adaptation to redox stress. Analysis of mouse kidneys showed oxidation of proteins circulating in biofluids, through which cellular redox stress can affect whole-body physiology. Obtaining accurate peptide oxidation profiles from complex organs using SICyLIA holds promise for future analysis of patient-derived samples to study human pathologies.",
