COVID-19 was initially identified as a respiratory system disease, but it has since been discovered to interact with and affect the cardiovascular system, causing myocardial damage and cardiac and endothelial dysfunction primarily through the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor(2,3,4,5). Similarly to COVID-19 infection, reports have suggested a link between myocarditis and the use of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019. (Covid-19), male patients aged 16 to 29 years had the highest incidence of myocarditis (10.69 cases per 100,000 people. A total of 76% of myocarditis cases were classified as mild, 22% as intermediate, and 1 case was associated with cardiogenic shock(6). In the Israeli study by Barda et al.,(7)vaccination resulted in 2.7 excess cases of myocarditis per 100,000 vaccinated persons. The CDC estimates that the incidence of myocarditis after any Covid-19 vaccination is 0.48 cases per 100,000 overall and 1.2 cases per 100,000 among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 29 based on data from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System(8). Moreover, the most common coagulation abnormalities in COVID19 patients point to a hypercoagulable state, which has been labeled thromboinflammation or COVID19\u2013associated hemostatic abnormalities (CAHA)(9,10,11). As same as&nbsp;covid-19 infection ,the discovery of the rare but serious and potentially fatal complication of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) raised concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, prompting many countries to reconsider vaccination strategies(12,13). Cases of apparent secondary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) following SARSCoV2 vaccination with both the Pfizer and Moderna versions have been reported and brought to public attention(14). Herein, we&nbsp;hypothesize a testable hypothesis that high secretion of IL-6&nbsp;in both COVID-19 infection and Vaccination could lead to these&nbsp;adverse effects of&nbsp;myocarditis and thrombosis.&nbsp;In addition to depending on this hypothesis we suggest that there&nbsp;are real risks of exercising&nbsp;via inducing proinflammatory IL-6 after the COVID-19 vaccine and infection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;1-2-OUR HYPOTHESIS</strong></p><p><strong>1-2-1-COVID-19 Infection and Vaccine could induce the secretion of&nbsp;IL-6</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Both COVID-19 infection and vaccination lead to hyper secretion of proinflammatory Il-6. The current evidence showed that severely ill patients tend to have&nbsp;a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, compared to those who are moderately ill(15).&nbsp;IL-6 is one of the&nbsp;key mediators of inflammation and viral cytokine storm&nbsp;in COVID-19. After viral infection, viral products also enhance the transcription or translation of IL-6 from cells such as fibroblast, mesenchyme, endothelial and many other cells(16). Cytokine storm is suggested as one of the major pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, It was found&nbsp;that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in epithelial cells promotes IL-6 trans-signaling by activation of the AT1 axis to initiate coordination of a hyper-inflammatory response(17). Also, It was showed that increase of TNF-a and&nbsp;IL-6&nbsp;was found after the 1st&nbsp;vaccination&nbsp;in individuals with pre-existing&nbsp;COVID-19 immunity(18) and also,&nbsp;IL-6 were significantly higher after the second COVID vaccination dose of S-Protein Based Vaccines&nbsp;for&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;&nbsp;at day 23 than those at day 2 (18). Compared to the DNA vaccine, the mRNA vaccine induced a more robust production of IL-5, IL-6(19) .&nbsp;Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, a heterodimeric cytokine belonging to the IL-12 family were increased early upon vaccine administration(20).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1-2-2- Strenuous exercise couild induce the secretion of IL-6 via lactate</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>IL-6 is produced by many different cell types including monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and adipocytes (21). Exercise causes the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from skeletal muscle cells (22,26), Exercise-mediated IL-6 release is tightly correlated with exercise intensity and duration; thus, IL-6 is considered an energy sensor that is released from contracting muscles during strenuous exercise, as shown in figure 2, concurrently with energy and glycogen depletion. Exercise is known to be associated with intramuscular activation of MMP2 and MMP9 as in figure 1, MMP-2 (a type of gelatinase A, 72 kDa)&nbsp;and MMP-9 (a type of gelatinase B, 92 kDa) are composed of 3 domains, distinguished by the presence of type II additional fibronectin domain inserted into the catalytic domain. (28,29,30,31). Both the activity and transcription of MMP2 and MMP9 have been shown to increase during an acute bout of exercise, and activation of matrix metalloproteinases has been measured as a spillover into the bloodstream. Matrix metalloproteinases and other proteases are known to mediate ectodomain shedding of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and their receptors, which occurs as part of the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems, for example. Exercise causes skeletal muscle cells to release IL-6, and it raises the plasma concentration of IL-6 100 times higher than at rest (23). Strenuous exercise raises levels of a variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The concentration of IL-6 increases up to 100-fold after strenuous exercise, such as a marathon race (3,4). Recently, it was shown that IL-6 is produced locally in contracting skeletal muscles and that the net release from the muscle can account for the exercise-induced increase in arterial concentration. IL-6 is produced in greater quantities in response to exercise than any other cytokine, IL-6 is produced locally in skeletal muscle in response to exercise, and IL-6 is known to increase hepatic glucose output and lipolysis. These findings suggest that IL-6 may be a critical link between contracting skeletal muscles and exercise-related metabolic changes (23,24). IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with numerous biological effects. In response to prolonged exercise, skeletal muscle produces IL-6, which is then released into the bloodstream. Circulating IL-6 is thought to keep energy levels stable during exercise by acting as an energy sensor and stimulating glucose production. If there is tissue damage, immune cells infiltrate and secrete cytokines, including IL-6, to repair the skeletal muscle damage. As skeletal muscle adapts to training, the IL-6 response to exercise is reduced with adequate rest and nutrition. Sustained IL-6 elevations, however, caused by repeated bouts of unfamiliar activities or prolonged exercise with limited rest, may have unfavourable physiologic effects, such as accelerated muscle proteolysis and decreased nutrient absorption, and may impair normal adaptive responses to training. . Recent intervention studies have looked into the role of mixed meals or carbohydrate, protein, omega-3 fatty acid, or antioxidant supplementation in reducing exercise-induced IL-6 increases. Emerging evidence suggests that adequate energy intake prior to exercise is important in reducing exercise-induced IL-6 by preserving muscle glycogen. We describe various nutritional interventions that may affect the IL-6 response to exercise in healthy human adults and make suggestions for future research into the role of IL-6 in the adaptive response to exercise. \u2013 (22,23). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that modulates cells that express membrane-bound IL-6 receptors; however, IL-6 in complex with soluble IL-6R can bind to any cell that expresses glycoprotein 130. (gp130). As a result, all cell types may respond to IL-6's pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. Since the first report of an acute exercise-induced increase in plasma IL-6 in the early 1990s, scientists have attempted to identify the factors that influence the magnitude of change in plasma IL-6, as well as the potential biological roles of this cytokine. Evidence suggests that the intensity and duration of exercise, as well as the type of contraction (eccentric or concentric), and muscle damage, all influence the IL-6 response to acute exercise. Most studies in the last decade have focused on IL-6 as a 'energy sensor,' possibly secreted by skeletal muscle, that activates glycogenolysis in the liver and lipolysis in fat tissue to provide muscle with the increasing energy demands during exercise. (23,24,25). Exercise causes an increase in IL-6 plasma concentrations. Peak IL-6 levels are reached at the end of the exercise or shortly thereafter. Chronic increase in IL-6 lead to hyperinsulinemia, reduced body mass and impaired insulin to regulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. In elderly patients with type 2 DM, the circulating IL-6 level is 2 to 3 times higher than younger and healthier individuals (33,34,35).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1-3- Consequences of Our hypothesis</strong></p><p><br></p><p>1-3-1-Crosstalk among IL -6, Deep Vein Thrombosis, Myocarditis and COVID vaccine</p><p><br></p><p>The risks of acute myocarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination have garnered intense social media attention(36).&nbsp;It was showed that most patients who experienced myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccine were male&nbsp;youth&nbsp;aged 16 to 29 years had the highest incidence of myocarditis(6). The highest incidence of myocarditis occurred after the second vaccination and mostly in young men (83 of 117 patients were aged \u226430 years and only 15 of 117 patients were women)(37,38). Most of the cases arose within the first week, typically 3\u20134 days after the vaccination&nbsp;In addition to the induction effect of COVID-19 vaccine on IL-6, vaccinated&nbsp;youth&nbsp;in this age could practice strenuous exercise and this could boost the effect of IL-6 leading to existing of&nbsp;myocarditis and thrombosis. Therefore, we suggest that IL-6 could induce myocarditis in those category of people as a result of strenuous exercise and vaccine effect.&nbsp;It was showed that IL-6 levels were significantly higher in those with CHD than in control individuals, long-term IL-6 levels are associated with CHD risk(36). Coronary heart disease (CHD), the leading cause of death among adults in developed countries, kills one person in the US every minute. This is known technically as a \"myocardial infarction\" (MI), but it is more commonly referred to as a heart attack. Cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol (a type of fat), being overweight, and being physically inactive all increase the risk of developing CHD, as do some inherited factors. CHD treatments include lifestyle changes (such as losing weight and exercising regularly) as well as medications that lower blood pressure and cholesterol. In the worst-case scenario, the narrowed artery can be widened with a stent or surgically bypassed(39). In addition myocarditis, also mRNA COVID vaccine was showed to induce thrombocytopenia and thrombosis&nbsp;in young people, two young, healthy doctors were diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis 27 and 29 days, respectively, after receiving the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine(40).&nbsp;An unusual presentation of acute deep vein thrombosis was discovered in the right upper extremity of a 27-year-old Caucasian female, 3 days after receiving her second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, according to a recent report describing 19 of 20 patients included age (range 22\u201373 years old) (41) Interleukin-6 has been shown to mediate the platelet abnormalities and thrombogenesis associated with experimental colitis in mice (42). Furthermore, Interleukin-6 stimulates thrombopoiesis via thrombopoietin (43) In line with previous research, we discovered that IL-6 was significantly upregulated in both DVT patients and DVT mice (44).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Study&nbsp;Description:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The study is configured as a retrospective and prospective observational study. The study will be multi-center and will involve&nbsp;young patient who will be vaccinated with&nbsp;first ,second and third&nbsp;dose of&nbsp;spike protein based vaccine (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine). Pfizer-BioNTech have successfully developed the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, which consists of the full-length S glycoprotein with the K986P and V987P mutation sites. The mRNA-1273 vaccine&nbsp;from the company Moderna contains the coding sequence for an S glycoprotein stabilized by a pair of proline substitutions (K986P/V987P), with a transmembrane anchor and an intact S1-S2 cleavage site(45). This study seeks to investigate the possible&nbsp;hypothesized correlation&nbsp;among strenuous exercise ,Il-6 and the rare adverse effects such as myocarditis and thrombosis in&nbsp;recently vaccinated&nbsp;young patients who practice strenuous exercise&nbsp;aged 16 to 40 years. In this study we will include both young patients who haven't been&nbsp;infected with COVID-19&nbsp;or who have been&nbsp;infected and completely recovered from COVID-19 infection. We will examine the levels of pro inflammatory IL-6&nbsp;the different stages of vaccination. We will assess the correlation among strenuous exercise, IL-6 production. Myocarditis and thrombosis. Moreover, we will investigate if the old infection have any adverse effects associated with the strenuous exercise and IL-6 production. We will assess the proinflammatory IL-6 and thrombotic factors like D dimer, thrombin and platelet aggregation in the different stages and doses of spike protein based vaccination.&nbsp;As Covid-19 is a new disease, the existing research literature on this specific topic is extremely limited, and so far this study would be the first in this area.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a type of interleukin that functions as both a pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine. It is encoded by the IL6 gene in humans. Both COVID-19 infection and&nbsp;S-Protein Based Vaccines&nbsp;for&nbsp;COVID-19 were found to induce the production of proinflammatory IL-6, and also, strenuous exercise was found to induce IL-6 secretion by the skeletal muscles via lactate. Exercise causes skeletal muscle cells to release IL-6, and it raises the plasma concentration of IL-6 100 times higher than at rest . Exercise-induced IL-6 release is highly correlated with exercise intensity and duration; thus, IL-6 is regarded as an energy sensor released by contracting muscles.&nbsp;but It was found that rare&nbsp;adverse effects such as myocardial infarction and coagulation abnormalities , are rarely associated with S-Protein Based Vaccines&nbsp;for&nbsp;COVID-19. Recently, it was&nbsp;showed in a study that most patients who experienced myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccine were young male&nbsp;youth&nbsp;aged 16 to 29 years had the highest incidence of myocarditis. Interestingly, It&nbsp;was observed&nbsp;that IL-6 was linked to adverse effects such as thrombosis and myocarditis, both of which are similar to that was caused by COVID-19 infection, and that S-Protein Based Vaccines for COVID-19.&nbsp;Here, we propose a testable hypothesis that&nbsp;strenuous exercise could be a risk and cofactor helping in&nbsp;the existing of these adverse effects in young people&nbsp;such as myocarditis and thrombosis via induction the secretion&nbsp;&nbsp;of proinflammatory IL-6. In our prospective observational study we will assess the possible correlation among&nbsp;the strenuous exercise , IL-6, myocarditis and thrombosis. The study will be multi-center and will involve&nbsp;young patient who will be vaccinated with&nbsp;first ,second and third&nbsp;dose of&nbsp;S-Protein Based Vaccines for COVID-19 (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine). Pfizer and BioNTech have successfully developed the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, which consists of the full-length S glycoprotein with the K986P and V987P mutation sites. Also, Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine contains the coding sequence for a S glycoprotein stabilized by a pair of proline substitutions (K986P/V987P), a transmembrane anchor, and an intact S1-S2 cleavage site</p>",
