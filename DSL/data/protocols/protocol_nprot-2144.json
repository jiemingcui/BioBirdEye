            "content": "A panel of improved ultrasensitive luciferase reporters was developed in an effort to enable analysis of different promoter activities in the same group of transfected cells. This approach would not only enable analysis of three or more pathways \\(responses) in the same group of cells  but also increase speed, sensitivity and cost of the assay. The preferred format of the assay is to measure the three different luciferase acitivites in the same sample of cell lysate sequentially. The Triple luciferase assay is basesd on luciferases with different emission maxima\\(Emission maxima of Cypridina luciferase is 467 nm,  Green Renilla Luciferase 530 nm, and red-emitting Firefly luciferase is 617 nm , Fig 2),   By choosing luciferases with different emission maxima , we provide an additional advantage in that multiple luciferases can be assayed in an optional format using a single luciferase assay reagent."

One day before the transfection experiment, adjust the cell concentration, and plate the cells so that cells are approximately confluent at the time of transfection.  For example, plating 2-5\u00d7106 cells in a 60-mm culture dish in 3 ml of medium overnight will achieve the desired density of 60-80% confluency.\r\n  \r\n\n\nPlasmids used:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1.: pUBC-RedFLuc-t2A-tdtomato -A plasmid expressing a red-emitting firefly luciferase \\(emission max 617 nm) under control of the Ubiquitin promoter and co-expressing  a red fluorescent protein \\(tdtomato) using a T2A element \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2.  pCMV-GLuc:  A plasmid expressing Gaussia luciferase \\(a secreted luciferase) under control of the CMV promoter\r\n  \r\n\n\n3.  pCMV-VLuc: A plasmid expressing Cypridina luciferase, a secreted luciferase under control fo the CMV promoter\r\n  \r\n\n\nTransfection of experimental cells\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. The following protocol is for 60 cm dish \\(culture medium: 5 ml). If you use 6-well or 12-well plates, total volume of the medium should be 2 ml and 1 ml, respectively, and decrease the amount of each reagent accordingly.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Plate cells the night before to give 60-80% confluence at the day of transfection. The efficiency will decrease if reached 100% confluence. Less than 50% confluence may be OK but the amount of protein expressed will be low because of the small numbers of cells.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Prior to the transfection, change to medium.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "In our search for multiplexed assays that increase both assay speed and sensitivity we have developed\r\n\n\na panel of  three ultrasensitive luciferase reporter-Cypridina luciferase \\(emission max 463 nm),  an improved  green-emtiting Renilla luciferase \\(emission max 527 nm) and a Red=emitting Luciola Italica firefly luciferase \\(emission max 617 nm).  The red-emitting firefly luciferase is a 1000 times brighter than it's native counterpart).  The green-emitting Renilla luciferase mutant is about 35-40 times brighter than native Renilla luciferase \\(human codon optimised best commercial version).  These luciferases thus offer increased sensitivity in screening applications involving analysis of weak promoters or hard-to-transfect cells. The green variant of Renilla luciferase also offers improved stability of the luminescent signal both in vitro and in vivo.   The triple luciferase assay reagents and protocol described here permit analysis of all three luciferases in the same sample of cell lysate and thus increases speed of the assay.  The assay system provides flexibility of  assaying the  three luciferase reporters in three formats as follows:  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\ni) All three luciferases can be assayed in the same sample of cell lysate by sequential addition of  Cypridina luciferase, Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase assay reagents to the same sample of cell lysate.  In the format the Cypridina luciferase reagent is added first and the sample assayed for Cypridina luciferase activity. Twenty minutes later the Cypridina luciferase signal decays completely and  the firefly luciferase assay reagent is added to measure the firefly luciferase acitivty. This is followed by the addition of the Renilla luciferase assay reagent \\(with an inhibitor of firefly luciferase)  which quenches the firefly luciferase and enables measurement of Renilla luciferase activity.  Thsi is the most preferred format of the assay as it improves speed fo the assay and improves sensitivty\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2) The  three luciferases are assayed using a single solution and spectrally resolving the luciferaes activities using appropriate filters.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3)The three luciferases can be assayed in separate samples of supernatant or cell lysate using the assay reagents for each luciferase.   \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis triple luciferase assay systems is particularly useful in studying multiple pathways within the same cell and profiling responsiveness at different times \\(without cell lysis) .  For example, using NFkB\r\n\n\nand CREB response elements to follow apoptosis and GPCR profiling in the same group of transfected cells.",
