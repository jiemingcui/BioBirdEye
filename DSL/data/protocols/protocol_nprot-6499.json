            "content": "Although CFU-e and BFU-e progenitors were defined functionally over four decades ago, their complete and pure prospective isolation from murine bone-marrow has not been possible. Our recent single-cell RNA-seq study developed a FACS strategy that achieves their isolation, as well as the isolation of a number of other early hematopoietic progenitors.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn this protocol, we first enrich Kit+ cells from total mouse bone marrow, using magnetic beads. This population is then labeled with antibodies against CD55, CD150, CD105, CD41, CD49f and CD71.  Kit+CD55- cells are lympho/ myeloid progenitors, whereas Kit+CD55+ cells contain erythroid/ megakaryocytic/ basophil progenitors. We subdivide Kit+CD55+ cells into 5 subsets, P1 to P5. P5 contains uncommitted progenitors biased towards the erythroid/ megakaryocytic/ basophil  lineages, including MPPs. P4, P3, and P1/P2 contain megakaryocytic, basophil/ mast cell, and erythroid progenitors, respectively. Specifically, P2 contains largely BFU-e cells, whereas P1 contains CFU-e, and no other progenitors. Of note, P1 can be further sub-divided into earlier CFU-e, forming larger colonies, and later CFU-e, forming smaller colonies, by selecting for P1-CD71<sup>medium</sup> and P1-CD71<sup>high</sup> gates, respectively."
