            "content": "Signal transduction cascades play essential roles for various organisms to adapt environmental changes and consist of various signaling molecules. Therefore, to analyze mechanisms of signal transduction pathways, it is important to observe dynamics of signaling molecules _in vivo_. For example, intracellular ion level has been observed using _in vivo_ imaging analyses such as calcium imaging<sup>1</sup>. However, signal transduction pathways are also composed of various signaling proteins. Signaling proteins alter their status in response to continuous environmental stimuli. Even though observation of specific protein activity _in vivo_ is crucial for understanding the signal transduction pathways, temporal dynamics of signaling proteins in living animals are largely unknown. To answer this question, we tried to monitor the activities of Ras protein which is one of the key regulators for cell growth, differentiation, olfactory reception and other biological processes<sup>2-4</sup>. Thus, we observed Ras activity in olfactory neuron in a living nematode worm _Caenorhabditis elegans_<sup>5</sup>. We used Raichu-Ras, a FRET-based sensor for Ras activity6. Raichu-Ras was expressed in AWC olfactory neurons in _C. elegans_ and we monitored Ras protein activity in vivo after stimulation of isoamyl alcohol which is an odorant sensed by the AWC neurons. Here we describe a detailed protocol for imaging of specific protein\u2019s activity in intact animals.\r\n\n\n_In vivo_ imaging of protein activity may be more difficult than calcium imaging since its dynamics of activity change is weaker than that of intracellular ion level in many cases. Therefore it is important to restrain animal\u2019s movement by gluing the animal on the agarose pad to minimize noise of fluorescent changes from the animal motion."

And then, pick up the animal and put them on 4% agarose pad made on a cover glass.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Immobilize the animal on the agarose pad by glue which is delivered through a drawn glass capillary tube. The tip of the animal\u2019s head is always kept free from glue.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Place the cover glass with glued animal in the 35 mm laboratory dish and cover with 4 ml imaging buffer solution.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Capture the images of cell body of the olfactory neuron expressing the probe by a microscope equipped with 40\u00d7 or 63\u00d7 objective lens and a digital camera device. During imaging analysis, room temperature is kept at 20-23\no\nC.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. During collection of the images, add 20 \u03bcl odorants solution to the buffer covering animals using pipetman as the odorant stimuli. The final concentration of the odorants are 5 \u00d7 10\n-4\n, 1 \u00d7 10\n-3\n, 1.5 \u00d7 10\n-3\nafter the first, second and third stimulation, respectively.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. After the imaging experiment, exclude crosstalk between the YFP and CFP emission spectra using a linear unmixing method to distinguish weak signals representing Ras activity from noise \\(optional).\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Calculate fluorescent intensity using the imaging software."

            "content": "Ras imaging clearly showed its activity changes were occurred after an odorant stimulus in olfactory neurons in living animals \\(Fig. 1). After application of odorants, the changes in YFP and CFP fluorescence intensities opposed each other and ratio changes were also observed \\(Fig. 1b, c). Ratio changes of Raichu-Ras occurred within few seconds after odor addition. After reaching the peak, the ratio decreased to the basal level within 2 \u2013 3 sec even if the odorant was still present. Therefore, it revealed that responses of Ras to odorants were quick and transient in the olfactory neurons. This protocol enabled to measure such temporal properties of single protein activity _in vivo_."
