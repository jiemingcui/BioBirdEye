            "content": "Current approaches to study genes in immune cells using shRNA or CRISPR technology involve stimulating the immune cells in vitro, transducing them with a lentiviral vector, and transferring them back in vivo. These approaches are limited by inefficient vector delivery, the requirement for stimulation which can perturb cell states, and their use on populations that can be easily transferred in vivo. Here we circumvent those issues by transducing hematopoietic stem cells with a lentiviral gene-targeting sgRNA expression vector, which are then used to make bone marrow chimeras. The resulting immune system of these chimeras is deleted for the gene of interest yet is naive and unstimulated.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7651/original/Lentivirus_Schematic.png?1552794197\">See figure in Figures section.</a>"

Finger flick gently to mix.\r\n\n\nStep 3: Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.\r\n\n\nStep 4: Heat shock for 45 seconds at 42\u00b0C.\r\n\n\nStep 5: Place back on ice for 5 minutes.\r\n\n\nStep 6: Add room temp SOC media on top \\(1000 microliters).\r\n\n\nStep 7: Place on shaking heat block \\(350 rpm 37 Celsius) for 1 hour.\r\n\n\nStep 8: Take LB-Amp plates out of fridge to warm to room temp. Label with date and vector + insert name.\r\n\n\nStep 9: After one hour incubation of bacteria, pellet by placing in table top centrifuge and holding short to spin for 30 seconds. Remove 900 microliters without disturbing pellet and discard.\r\n\n\nStep 10: Resuspend the pellet in remaining 150 microliters and plate on LB-Amp plate.\r\n\n\nStep 11: Add 6-8 mixing beads and shake around for 30 seconds.\r\n\n\nStep 12: Discard beads and let plate sit for 5 minutes to absorb liquid.\r\n\n\nStep 13: Invert plate and place in 37\u00b0C incubator overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 3: Miniculture\r\n\n\nStep 1: Prepare LB Broth and 1X Amp.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Aliquot 3 mL of LB-Amp into mini culture tubes.\r\n\n\nStep 3: Pick 4 colonies/ligation plate \\(except blank plate) using pipette tip, put tips in miniculture tubes.\r\n\n\nStep 4: Incubate for 8 hours in 37\u00b0C shaker incubator.\r\n\n\nStep 5: Prepare glycerol stocks: 2 drops of 95% glycerol stock and 180 uL of bacteria culture => Freeze at -80\u00b0C.\r\n\n\nStep 6: Perform miniprep using Qiagen Miniprep kit. Quantify DNA using Qubit.\r\n\n\nStep 7: Submit miniculture for Sanger sequencing with sequencing primer.\r\n\n\nStep 8: Thaw out some 293x and keep in culture with DMEM 10% FBS media.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 4:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Determine which colonies were correct and contain your insert based on sequencing.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Inoculate a maxi culture with your glycerol stock for 18 hours in 37\u00b0C bacterial shaker.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 5:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Perform a maxi prep using Qiagen Hispeed Maxi kit.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Quantify the maxi by Qubit and confirm with Sanger sequencing again.\r\n\n\nStep 3: Plate 18 million 293x in DMEM 10% FBS into T175s \\(for each set of virus you want to make).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 6:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Change media on 293x cells, 1 hour before you want to transfect.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Prepare transfection mix:\nSee figure in Figures section.\nStep 3: After 1 hour post-media change, drip drop the transfection mixture onto flask. Keep flask level so media can cover all cells. Swirl flask around to mix. Place back in 37\u00b0C incubator overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 7:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Change media 24h after transfection and let incubate for another 48h before harvesting.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 9:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Transfer all media from flask \\(take from top corner and do not touch cells) into 50 mL conical. Dispose of the empty flask.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Spin tubes at 800g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C \\(to get rid of cells).\r\n\n\nStep 3: Transfer supernatant to another 50mL conical \\(leave behind pellet + 1mL) \r\n\n\nStep 4: Transfer to 30 mL syringe and filter through 0.45 um filter into ultra-high spin tubes. Then place on ice.\r\n\n\nStep 5: Clean ultracentrifuge rotors with 70% ethanol and dry out.\r\n\n\nStep 6: Load ultra-high spin tubes into the rotor. Note the rotor holds 6 tubes so if you have less than 6 samples fill the other tubes with PBS for balance.\r\n\n\nStep 7: Weigh each tube to ensure difference between each tube is no more than 0.1g.\r\n\n\nStep 8: Use ultra-centrifuge to spin down supernatant containing lentivirus. We use SW-28 rotor, speed 20,000 rpm, time 2 hours, and temperature 4\u00b0C.\r\n\n\nStep 9: Thaw out SFEM media at room temp meanwhile.\r\n\n\nStep 10: After centrifugation step, take out tubes and put on ice.\r\n\n\nStep 11: Invert tubes and dispose of supernatant.\r\n\n\nStep 12: Dry ultra-spin tube on top of Kim wipe \\(keep inverted) for 5 min.\r\n\n\nStep 13: Add 1 mL of SFEM \\(without cytokines) along the side of the tube \\(do not disturb bottom).\r\n\n\nStep 14: Parafilm to cover the top tightly, place tube on rack inside a Styrofoam box. Fill box with ice, make sure virus tube embedded in the ice.\r\n\n\nStep 15: Put on horizontal shaker in the cold room on super low shaking speed and let shake overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 10:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Pre label cryovial to freeze lentivirus.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Gently resuspend virus in 1mL SFEM \\(set pipette at 500 uL), be careful not to create bubbles. Transfer all of volume into labeled cryovial, aliquot out 5 microliter into an Eppendorf, and freeze the rest down in -80\u00b0C freezer.\r\n\n\nStep 3: Plate 293x cells in 96 well flat bottom in DMEM 10% FBS at 25,000 cell per well in 100 microliter.\r\n\n\nStep 4: Add on top polybrene in 100 microliter DMEM 10% FBS such that polybrene final concentration in the well is 10 ug/mL.\r\n\n\nStep 5: For each lentivirus plate 2, 0.2, and 0.02 microliter of virus. Make sure to leave a few blank control well.\r\n\n\nStep 6: Mix wells up and down and place in 37\u00b0C tissue culture incubator overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 11:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Change media on the 293x-viirus titer plate.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 13:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Trypsinize cells to detach, neutralize with media, and plate in a 96 well V bottom plate.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Read out the Vex+ % \\(AmCyan channel), gating on a blank sample, for the different titrations.\r\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate your lentivirus titer. Calculation is typically done on the dilution of virus that leads to a Vex+% between 1-20%. For example, assume 0.2 microliter leads to 16% Vex. Equation is: 16% *25000/Volume of virus = Viral titer. So calculating this one: 3200/.2 microliter = 16,000,000 particles/mL."

Although functional genomics has accelerated therapeutic target discovery in cancer, its use in primary immune cells is limited because vector delivery is inefficient and can perturb cell states. Here we describe CHIME: CHimeric IMmune Editing, a CRISPR-Cas9 bone marrow delivery system to rapidly evaluate gene function in innate and adaptive immune cells in vivo without ex vivo manipulation of these mature lineages. This approach enables efficient deletion of genes of interest in major immune lineages without altering their development or function. We use this approach to perform an in vivo pooled genetic screen and identify Ptpn2 as a negative regulator of CD8+ T cell-mediated responses to LCMV Clone 13 viral infection. These findings suggest that this genetic platform can enable rapid target discovery through pooled screening in immune cells in vivo.",
