            "content": "Conventional transgenic approaches manipulate both fetal and placental genome, so that it is not clear if symptoms originate from placental and/or fetal effects. Moreover, germ-line transmission of a transgene is obstacle for therapeutic application. Here we detail a placenta specific gene manipulation by transducing blastocysts with lentiviral vectors<sup>1</sup>. After a removal of zona pellucida which functions as a physical barrier, trophoblast cells lying outermost layer of blastocyst were transduced from outside with high-titer lentiviral vectors. As most placental cells descend from trophoblast cells while fetus originated from inner cell mass, transgene expression can be observed in trophoblast cells from preimplantation stages and in placenta throughout gestation. Transgenic placentas can be generated at 100% of efficiency while all fetuses remain non-transgenic. This technology provides a robust system for studying placental organogenesis with implications for the treatment of placental dysfunction."

            "content": "Here we describe a placenta specific gene manipulation by transducing zona free blastocyst with lentiviral vector<sup>1</sup>. Zona removal prior to transduction is critical step since it protects viral infection as a physical barrier. The procedure is not harmful to embryos if performed properly, so that almost all blastocysts survived zona removal and lentiviral vector transduction \\(1 x 10<sup>3</sup> ng-p24/ml). Usually about 30-40% of the transferred blastocysts developed to term as same efficiency as non-treated embryos. Transgene expression can be observed in trophoblast cells from preimplantation stages and in placenta throughout gestation. Transgenic placentas can be generated at 100% of efficiency while all fetuses remain non-transgenic. The expected copy number per genome is normally 1-10. When we lower the lentiviral vector concentration, efficient transduction was observed in 10 times lower concentration but with mosaic expression \\(**Figure 1**). As an alternative method, direct injection of lentiviral vectors into blastocoel of zona intact blastocyst can be used but with increased risk of gene transfer into fetus and mosaic expression in placenta<sup>1, 7</sup>. \r\n\n\nBy applying our method, the restoration of placental dysfunction and embryonic lethality can be achieved. Although tetraploid embryos are also able to complement impaired placenta when aggregated with defective embryos<sup>4, 8</sup>, the application of tetraploid complementation to non-rodents has been difficult and inefficient<sup>9, 10</sup>. It should be noted that lentiviral vector mediated gene transfer has the potential to be extended to other animal species. This protocol provides a robust system for studying placental organogenesis with implications for the treatment of placental dysfunction."
