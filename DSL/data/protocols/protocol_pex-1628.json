A respiratory mask was placed around the nose and mouth to deliver 1.5 % isoflurane for anaesthetization during surgery, and turned down to 0.5 % isoflurane during electrophysiology recording.\n3. The eyes were covered with erythromycin ointment to block the environmental light.\n4.After removing the scalp, a craniotomy window was created stereotaxically on V1. The craniotomy was filled with fresh warm sterile buffered saline throughout the entire recordings.\n5. The dura was carefully removed.\n6. The silicon electrode (A4x8-5mm, Neuronexus, US) was slowly inserted into V1 at a depth about 0.4-0.6 mm by a micromanipulator (Scientifica, US).\n7. Electrical signals were recorded at 30 kHz and amplified \u00d7 200 by multichannel data acquisition system (Bio-Signal Technologies, China).\n8. Spikes were high-pass filter at 300 Hz, detected as events exceeding a threshold of 5 \u00d7 s.d. below the noise, raster plot and peri stimulus time histogram (PSTH) were made.\n9. The spike waveforms were sorted off-line by OfflineSorter (Plexon, US)."
