            "content": "The tracking of the dynamics of single molecules and nano-objects over time has attracted growing interest<sup>1,2</sup>. One major example where this can be applied is the process of nucleation and growth of macromolecular aggregates. Protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils yields structures associated to physiological functions in organisms whereas a multitude of other amyloids are connected to diseases<sup>3-8</sup>. Nevertheless, common techniques relying on ensemble measurements lack the possibility to follow details on nucleation of oligomers, fibril growth, fragmentation, and secondary nucleation as all these processes occur at the same time. The ensemble average blurs these fundamental single steps, thus much effort in sophisticated modeling<sup>9,10</sup> or other well-designed experiments is required<sup>11,12</sup>.\r\n\n\nWe present a trap in this protocol which works with the actual fuel of Brownian motion -- temperature -- to confine single amyloid fibrils to a region of interest over extended time periods of up to several hours. The fibrils are in solution during the experiments and no surface immobilization is necessary. Trapping is enabled by temperature gradients which lead to thermophoretic drifts of the investigated fibrils due to temperature-dependent solute-solvent interactions<sup>13-16</sup>. A drift velocity _v_<sub>T</sub> which results from these interactions can be assigned to the temperature gradient \u2207 _T_ via _v_<sub>T</sub> = - _D_<sub>T</sub>\u2207 _T_. _D_<sub>T</sub> is called thermodiffusion coefficient and describes the strength of the thermophoretic drift.  Different physical mechanisms contribute to this coefficient<sup>14</sup>, however, in most cases _D_<sub>T</sub> is found to be positive, i.e., the corresponding object moves from the hot to the colder region in the temperature gradient. A measure for the relative strength of these drifts can be found in the Soret coefficient _S_<sub>T</sub> defined as the ratio of the thermodiffusion coefficient over the diffusion coefficient: _S_<sub>T</sub> = _D_<sub>T</sub> / _D_<sub>t</sub>. Typical values range in between _S_<sub>T</sub> = 0.01...10 K<sup>-1</sup> depending on the size and the composition of the object of study.\r\n\n\nWe generate temperature fields by optically heating one chrome ring out of a whole array deposited on a glass cover slip utilizing a focused laser beam \\(beam waist _\u03c9_<sub>0</sub> \u2248 500 nm) of 808 nm wavelength to provide high temperature gradients at low temperature increments \\(see Figure 1). By rotating the focused laser beam at a frequency of _f_ = 100 Hz on the chrome ring with the help of an acousto-optic deflector, a time averaged temperature field can be generated which has its minimum in the center and is maximal at the chrome structure. Objects with a positive Soret coefficient are thus confined to the center of the trap. The thickness of the sample is controlled with a second cover slip. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<figure>\r\n\n\n<center>\r\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7635/original/Trapping_Scheme.png?1552667411\" title=\"Figure 1\" height=\"250px\"></center>\r\n\n\n<figcaption> <font size=\"1\" line-height:\"2px\">**Fig. 1: Sketch of the trapping mechanism.** A static temperature field is generated by a chrome ring which is heated by a focused laser beam rotating at a high frequency on the ring.</font> </figcaption>\r\n\n\n</figure>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis protocol describes the setup for such single-fibril trapping experiments and provides a step-by-step manual for the production of the chrome structure using UV lithography, the preparation of A\u03b2<sub>40</sub>, A\u03b2<sub>42</sub> and pGlu<sub>3</sub>-A\u03b2<sub>3-40</sub><sup>17</sup> amyloid fibrils as example systems, and setting up a measurement sample. All optical components are selected according to the fluorescent staining of the fibrils with Thioflavin T<sup>18,19</sup>. The configuration of lasers \\(and therefore the acousto-optic deflector, the dichroic mirror and the filters which are designed for a specific wavelength or wavelength regime) might change for systems labeled with other dyes. \r\n\n\nContrary to feedback systems<sup>20,21</sup>, trapping of an object in our thermophoretic setup does not require continuous fluorescence excitation due to the static temperature landscape. Hence, experiments with periods in which the laser for excitation is switched off \\(intermittent observation) drastically reduce photo-bleaching effects and permit long-time studies up to several hours. Nevertheless, combined with a real time tracking routine a feedback system is available as well<sup>22</sup>. \r\n\n\nIn the presented case of a nearly harmonic temperature profile with a curvature _\u03b1_ \\(see<sup>22</sup>), all objects with a Soret coefficient _S_<sub>T</sub> can be trapped for which the radius of the metal ring is larger than the width of the resulting position distribution _\u03c3_ = 1 / \\(_S_<sub>T</sub> _\u03b1_)<sup>0.5</sup>.\r\n\n\nIf no UV lithography setup is accessible, an alternative method resulting in a random distribution of traps on a cover slip is polystyrene bead lithography described in<sup>23</sup>."

            "content": "**Microscopy Setup**\r\n\n\nA sketch of the experimental setup can be found in Figure 2. The setup is built around an inverted microscope. A piezo translation stage mounted to the microscope is used for fine-positioning of the trap right before a trapping experiment starts. The beam diameter of a CW laser at a wavelength of 808 nm used for the heating of the chrome ring is increased by a beam expander. Afterwards, the widened laser beam is sent through an acousto-optic deflector \\(AOD) and a lens system which allows for the steering of the laser focus in the sample plane on the circumference of the chrome ring. Fluorescence excitation of the labeled fibrils is done with a 445 nm CW laser which is focused to the back-focal plane of the objective to attain a homogeneous illumination of the sample in the trapping region. Both laser beams are merged by a pellicle beam splitter \\(BS). A dichroic mirror \\(D) is selected according to the excitation and the heating laser wavelengths as well as the emission wavelength of the labeled sample. Reflections of the heating laser in the detection pathway are blocked with a short-pass filter. Fluorescent light of the sample is imaged to an EMCCD after passing a bandpass filter \\(F) as well as a tube lens. The AD/DA converter drives the acousto-optic deflector and the piezo stage. The fluorescence is imaged in real time and the control of the AD/DA converter \\(ADwin) is done with a custom LabVIEW program.\n**Fig. 2: Sketch of the experimental setup.**\n**UV Lithography**\r\n\n\nUV lithography is used to provide glass cover slips with the chrome structures. This chrome structure constitutes the traps for the thermophoretic experiments. As the photoresist used for the UV lithography is highly sensitive to visible light in the lower spectral range and UV light, the procedure has to be executed in a specific photolithography room. Commonly, the ambient illumination in these rooms is realized with yellow fluorescent light tubes containing filters blocking all light components which are below 500 nm. A photomask for the UV lithography system was produced according to an AutoCAD file with the designed chrome structures as shown in Figure 3.\n**Fig. 3: CAD images of the chrome structure.** The chrome traps are arranged in arrays. On each quadrant of the cover slip arrays of rings can be found with inner diameters of 8 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm, 14 \u03bcm, and 20 \u03bcm. They are separated by a cross. The capital \"L\" in the left top corner indicates the upper side on the cover slip.\n1. Thoroughly clean a glass cover slip with acetone and isopropyle.\r\n  2. Dry the clean glass cover slip on the hotplate at 120 \u00b0C for 10 min.\r\n  3. During the previous step, switch on the UV lithography system and install the photomask.\r\n  4. Fix the cleaned glass cover slip on the spin coater.\r\n  5. Spin coat 100 \u03bcl of the adhesion promoter on the glass cover slip at 3000 rpm for 30 s using dynamic dispense spin coating technique. No residual drops or film of the adhesion promoter should be visible after spin coating.\r\n  6. Bake the adhesion promoter immediately after spin coating at 120 \u00b0C on the hotplate for 2 min.\r\n  7. Fix the cover slip on the spin coater.\r\n  8. Spin coat 200 \u03bcl of the negative photoresist on the glass cover slip at 3000 rpm for 30 s using dynamic dispense spin coating technique.\r\n  9. Soft-bake the photoresist immediately after spin coating at 110 \u00b0C on the hotplate for 60 s.\r\n  10. Fix the cover slip to the UV lithography system and align it with the photomask \\(for optimal exposure).\r\n  11. Expose the cover slip to the UV laser \\(66 mJ cm\n\u22122\n, i-line).\r\n  12. Dismantle the cover slip from the UV lithography system and bake it at 110 \u00b0C for 60 s.\r\n  13. Develop the photoresist for 60 s. For this purpose, fill a 50 ml baker with the developer and wave the cover slip for exactly 60 s in the baker with a tweezer under the exhaustive hood.\r\n  14. Thoroughly rinse the cover slip with Milli-Q water. The future chrome structures should already be visible on the cover slip at this point.\r\n  15. Thermally evaporate a 30 nm chrome layer on the cover slip.\r\n  16. Strip the resist with the remover in the ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The chrome structure remains.\r\n  17.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "The observation of single freely suspended amyloid fibrils in liquids for minutes and hours is due to Brownian motion very difficult. We present a force-free trapping method in this protocol, which is able to confine the motion of these objects to a region of interest. To achieve this confinement, we use thermophoretic drifts of molecules suspended in a temperature gradient in liquids. The temperature gradient is generated by a metallic nano-structure that is heated by a focused laser beam. The amyloid fibrils are trapped in the temperature minimum created above the structure since  most molecules and nano-objects move towards the cold. The trapping capability is determined by the ratio of the thermophoretic mobility to the diffusion coefficient, which is called Soret coefficient, and the temperature contrast in the liquid.",
