            "content": "DNA double-strand breaks \\(DSBs) are major DNA lesions that form in a variety of physiological conditions \u2013 such as transcription \\(1-2), meiosis \\(3), and VDJ recombination \\(4) as well as a consequence of exposure to DNA damaging agents and replication stress \\(5). DSBs can also be induced in a controlled fashion at specific sites in the genome using programmable nucleases, such as the CRISPR \\(clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated RNA-guided endonucleases, Cas9 and Cpf1, which have greatly advanced genome editing. However, the potentially mutagenic off-target DNA cleavage activity of these nucleases represents an issue of major concern that needs to be thoroughly assessed before these enzymes can be safely used in the clinical setting \\(6). Thus, developing methods that can accurately map the genome-wide location of endogenous as well as exogenous DSBs in different systems and conditions is not only essential to advance our understanding of DSB biology, but is also critical for successful translation of programmable nucleases from research tools into clinical applications. \r\n\n\n In the past few years, several methods based on next-generation sequencing have been developed to assess DSBs at genomic scale, including ChIP-seq \\(7-8), BLESS \\(9-11), GUIDEseq \\(12), Digenome-seq \\(13), IDLV-mediated DNA break capture \\(14), HTGTS \\(15), and more recently End-Seq \\(16) and DSBCapture \\(17). While in general all of these methods represent important complementary tools to detect DSBs genome-wide \\(**Supplementary Table 1**), they also have important drawbacks. For example, ChIP-seq of DSB-sensing or repair proteins such as p53 Binding Protein 1 \\(53BP1) or the phosphorylated variant histone H2A.X \\(\u03b3H2A.X) does not label DSBs directly, and is unable to identify DNA breakpoints with single-nucleotide resolution. GUIDEseq, IDLV-mediated DNA break capture, and HTGTS detect DSBs by quantifying the products of non-homologous end-joining \\(NHEJ) repair, potentially missing DSBs that are repaired through other pathways. Furthermore, _in vivo_ delivery of exogenous oligonucleotides in GUIDEseq or viral cassettes in IDLV-mediated DNA break capture is challenging especially in primary cells and intact tissues. DSBs induced by programmable nucleases, such as CRISPR-associated RNA-guided Cas9 and Cpf1, can be evaluated _in vitro_ using Digenome-seq, but this approach may not be representative of physiologically relevant conditions \u2013 such as chromatin environment and nuclear architecture \u2013 that are likely to influence the frequency of DNA breaking and repair, or of relevant nuclease concentrations. Lastly, BLESS and the related methods End-Seq \\(16) and DSBCapture \\(17), require substantial amounts of input material \\(typically, in the order of millions of cells), they are labor-intensive, and are semi-quantitative due to lack of appropriate controls for PCR amplification biases, limiting their applications and scalability. Here, we describe a method for Breaks Labeling _In Situ_ and Sequencing \\(BLISS)\\(**Figure 1a**) that compared to other DSB mapping methods is more versatile, sensitive, and quantitative."

Place the coverslips in a 10 cm dish, cover them with 5 ml PLL solution, and then gently shake the dishes for 15 min \r\n  **Note**: make sure that coverslips stay covered by liquid\r\n\n\n2. Aspirate the solution and transfer it into a 15 ml tube\r\n  **Note**: the solution can be then used up to three times\r\n\n\n3. Wash the coverslips three times with 1\u00d7 PBS at room temperature \\(rt) and once with ethanol \\(EtOH) 70%\r\n  4. Air-dry the coverslips and proceed with cell spotting and fixation\r\n  **Breakpoint**: if not used immediately, coverslips can be stored in EtOH 70% at 4 \u00b0C and air-dried just before use.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Attachment and fixation of suspension cells** \\(for BLISS in cells)\r\n\n\n1. Place the desired number of PLL-coated coverslips into a 24-well cell culture plate\r\n  2. In each well, dispense a cell suspension freshly prepared in 1\u00d7 PBS\r\n  **Note**: we usually spot up to 3\u00d710\n5\ncells onto a 13 mm coverslip\r\n\n\n3. Let the cells sediment onto the coverslip for 10 min at rt\r\n  4. Slowly add one volume of PFA 8% in 1\u00d7 PBS equal to the volume of cell suspension added before onto the coverslip\r\n  5.

After transfection, aspirate the medium and wash the cells in 1\u00d7 PBS at rt \r\n  6. To each well, add 0.5 ml of PFA 4% in 1\u00d7 PBS at rt\r\n  7. Incubate for 10 min at rt\r\n  8.

Briefly rinse the sample in 1\u00d7 PBS at rt\r\n  **Note**: for samples on 13 mm coverslips, this is conveniently done in a 12- or 24-well plate. For tissue-BLISS, the tissue section is covered with a Secure-Seal\u2122 Hybridization Chamber. All the steps until post _in situ_ ligation are done by pipetting 100 \u03bcl volumes in and out of the chamber.\r\n\n\n2. Incubate the sample in LB1 for 1h at 4 \u00b0C\r\n  3.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Precisely measuring the location and frequency of DNA double-strand breaks \\(DSBs) along the genome is instrumental to understanding genomic fragility, but current methods are limited in versatility, sensitivity, or practicality. Here, we present Breaks Labeling _In Situ_ and Sequencing \\(BLISS), featuring: 1) direct labeling of DSBs in fixed cells or tissue sections on a solid surface; 2) low-input requirement by linear amplification of tagged DSBs by _in vitro_ transcription; 3) quantification of DSBs through unique molecular identifiers; and 4) easy scalability and multiplexing. We apply BLISS to profile endogenous and exogenous DSBs in low-input samples of cancer cells, embryonic stem cells, and liver tissue. We demonstrate the sensitivity of BLISS by assessing the genome-wide off-target activity of two CRISPR-associated RNA-guided endonucleases, Cas9 and Cpf1, observing that Cpf1 has higher specificity than Cas9. Our results establish BLISS as a versatile, sensitive, and efficient method for genome-wide DSB mapping in many applications.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nW.Yan and R.Mirzazadeh equally contributed to this work.",
