            "content": "Non-coding RNAs \\(ncRNAs) have emerged as important regulatory elements of gene expression in a wide variety of biological processes. RNA molecules mature through various post-transcriptional processing events in a spatiotemporal manner. Post-transcriptional modifications \\(or RNA editing) are characteristic structural features of RNA molecules and are required for their proper functioning. Most of these modifications have been found in abundant RNA molecules, such as tRNAs, rRNAs and/or UsnRNAs. It has recently been reported that even small RNAs are modified. In mammals, certain populations of miRNAs \\(~6%) contain inosine \\(I)<sup>1,2</sup>. In plants, the 3'-termini of miRNAs are modified by 2'methylation<sup>3</sup>, and this modification is required for normal maturation of miRNAs<sup>4</sup>. Recently, we found that mouse Piwi-interacting RNAs \\(piRNAs) also have 3'-terminal 2'methylations<sup>5</sup>. Direct analysis of RNA molecules by mass spectrometry provides qualitative information about the nature of the modifications embedded in RNA molecules, such as base modifications and terminal chemical structures. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for the mass spectrometric analysis of the 3' termini in ncRNAs."

Since mature tRNA and piRNA molecules possess 5'-monophosphate and 3'-hydroxy groups, RNase T<sub>2</sub> hydrolysates consist of 3',5'-diphosphonucleotides derived from 5' terminal residues \\(pNp in schemes 1 and 2), 3'-monophosphonucleotides derived from internal residues \\(Np in scheme 1 and 2) and nucleosides derived from 3' terminal residues \\(N<sub>OH</sub> in scheme 1, Nm in scheme 2). Thus, only 3'-terminal residues are converted to nucleosides in this analysis. Nucleosides can be easily discriminated from various nucleotides because of their characteristic molecular weights.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/400/original/400.jpg\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, RNase T<sub>2</sub> hydrolysates of yeast tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> yield four major mononucleotides \\(Cp, Up, Gp and Ap) and six minor modified nucleotides \\(Dp, &#x3A8;p, m<sup>5</sup>Cp, m<sup>7</sup>Gp, m<sup>5</sup>Up and m<sup>2</sup>Gp)<sup>7</sup>.
