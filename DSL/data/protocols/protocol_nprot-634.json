Prepare a 10-mM solution of DB in HCl-acidified ethanol \\(pH 4 or lower).\r\n  2. Add a few milligrams of sodium borohydride to reduce quinone.

Measure complex III activity at several protein concentrations paying attention to the linearity of the reaction. To determine the reduction of cytochrome _c_ due to the specific activity of complex III, for each sample, perform parallel measurements of activity in the presence and in the absence of antimycin A, an inhibitor of complex III.\r\n\n\n1. Prepare two cuvettes containing 200 \u00b5l of 250 mM PK buffer, pH 7.4, 40 \u00b5l of 50 mM NaN\n3\n, and 50 \u00b5l of 1 mM cytochrome _c_.

For each sample, measure complex IV activity twice at at least two protein concentrations that ensure the linearity of the reaction.\r\n\n\n1. Reduce cytochrome _c_ by adding tiny amounts of sodium dithionite until the absorbance at 550 nm of 100 \u00b5l of cytochrome _c_ in 1 ml of H\n2\nO is between 1.8 and 1.9. \r\n  2. In a cuvette, add 100 \u00b5l of 100 mM PK buffer, pH 7.0, 100 \u00b5l of reduced cytochrome _c_ and adjust the volume with H\n2\nO \\(800 \u00b5l minus sample volume).\r\n  3. Incubate the cuvette at 30 \u00b0C for 2 min.\r\n  4. Start the reaction by adding 2-10 \u00b5g of mitochondrial proteins. \r\n  5. Measure absorbance of the sample at 550 nm for 2 min.\r\n  6. Verify the specificity of cytochrome _c_ reduction by inhibiting cytochrome _c_ oxidase activity with 50 \u00b5l of 40 mM KCN.\r\n  7.    Calculate complex IV specific activity using the Beer-Lambert law equation \\(Fig. 1). Express the activity as nanomoles of cytochrome _c_ oxidised per minute per milligram of protein.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**ATP synthase \\(Complex V) activity assay**\r\n\n\nDetermine complex V activity by measuring spectrophotometrically at 30 \u00b0C for 2 minutes the oxidation of NADH as indicated by the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm \\(Refs. 2-3). Repeat each measurement twice at at least two protein concentrations that ensure the linearity of the reaction.\r\n\n\n1. In a cuvette add 500 \u00b5l of Buffer H-Mg, 10 \u00b5l of 30 mM NADH, 50 \u00b5l of 50 mM phosphoenolpyruvic acid, 5 \u00b5l of 10 mg/ml of pyruvate kinase, 10 \u00b5l of 5 mg/ml of lactate dehydrogenase, and 10 \u00b5l of antimycin A.\r\n  2.

Record the baseline for 2 min.\r\n  6. Start the reaction by adding 100 \u00b5l of 25 mM ATP. \r\n  7. Measure absorbance of the sample for 2 min \\(?Abs\n340nm\nwithout oligomycin\n)\r\n  8.
