Make sure these viewpoints are located on small restriction fragments generated by the restriction enzyme used for chromatin digestion. Fragments in the range of 120\u2013250 bp are preferred. We would advise selecting the restriction enzyme based on its cut site distribution around the viewpoints of interest and choosing the restriction enzyme that gives the most favorable fragment sizes. We usually use NlaIII or DpnII for chromatin digestion. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe capture oligonucleotides should be designed to the middle of the restriction fragments on which the viewpoints of interest are located.

Run samples and controls on a 1% agarose gel at 100 V for 1-2 hours\u00a0(Appendix).\n\u2022 Control 1: 10 \u00b5l\n\u2022 Control 2: 10 \u00b5l\n\u2022 3C library: 5 \u00b5l\n2. Use Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit to calculate concentration. 107 cells should produce around 15-25 \u03bcg of library.\nNote: The Nanodrop or similar spectrophotometers are unreliable for quantifying 3C libraries due to residual DTT from the ligation buffer.\nSonication and addition of Illumina sequencing adaptors\nBased on the protocol for the NEBNext DNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina (E6040S/L)\nNotes:\nA) In this step, it is important to maintain library complexity by maximizing input DNA and minimizing DNA losses during the reactions and clean ups. The protocol described below is based on the NEBNext DNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina (E6040S/L). In this protocol, up to 5 ug can be used per reaction. When there is plenty of 3C library material available, we recommend performing two parallel preps. These can be pooled prior to hybridization.\nWhen there is limited 3C library material available, we recommend using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7645S/L), which is more efficient. We normally sonicate 2 ug of 3C library and use all recovered material (~1.5 ug) in the library prep reaction. If possible, we recommend performing multiple parallel reactions to maximize library complexity. When you have 4-6 ug of 3C library available, we would recommend sonicating all material in one tube and splitting it over 2-3 Ultra II reactions, rather than pooling all material in one reacting using the NEBNext DNA Library Prep Master Mix Set.\nB) The NEB protocol often recommends removing the DNA from the beads with a few \u03bcl more water than is necessary for the next step in the protocol. One can avoid doing this to minimize losses, but this means being very careful with the bead clean ups as contamination by the beads or ethanol can inhibit the following reaction.\nC) We use the Covaris S220 Focused Ultrasonicator for sonication. If using a different model sonicator, use high molecular weight gDNA to optimize sonication for a modal distribution around 450 bp in size\u00a0(Appendix).\nD) The Illumina indices that you put on to the library need to be complementary to the Nimblegen HE blocking oligonucleotides required in the capture step\u00a0(the kits do not match; Appendix). Buying both primer set 1 and primer set 2 eliminates waste of the more expensive Nimblegen blocking kit.\nE) Size selection is only performed after sonication and not necessary after the library preparation reactions, as adaptor dimers will not be captured. AmpureXP bead clean up after sonication is performed with 0.7 x volume of beads and all subsequent clean ups are performed with 1.8 x volume of beads.\nI. Sonication\n1. Prepare 5-6 \u03bcg of 3C library in a total volume of 120 \u00b5l in a Covaris microtube. Avoid making bubbles.\n2.

PCR addition of indices\nNotes:\nA) Herculase II is used instead of the NEB polymerase as it performs better in our hands.\nB) PCR is performed in duplicate on half the sample at a time.

Quantify library using Qubit dsDNA BR assay kit.\n[SAFE STOPPING POINT \u2013 Store at -20\u00baC]\nCapture enrichment\nBased on the Nimblegen SeqCap SR User\u2019s Guide Chapter 5-7.\nI. Hybridization preparation\nNote: Ensure capture oligonucleotides for different experiments are kept apart. The oligonucleotides are hugely in excess and tiny amounts of contamination can lead to spurious results. We would recommend that you do not order oligonucleotides that should not be mixed from the manufacturer at the same time. Avoid having buffers and blocking oligonucleotides out at the same time as the capture oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides that are going to be pooled for a single experiment, can be ordered together. Consider ordering large designs in as a pooled set\u00a0(at equimolar concentrations).\nBiotinylated capture oligonucleotides\n1. Reconstitute individual or pools of oligonucleotides to a stock concentration so that each oligonucleotide is stored at 2.9 \u00b5M\u00a0(10 nmol in 3.46 \u03bcl of PCR grade water) \u2013 or any high concentration.\n2. Generate pools of oligonucleotides by mixing in exact 1:1 stoichiometric ratio.\n3. Make working solution of oligonucleotides by diluting pools so that each individual oligonucleotide is at 2.9 nM. e.g. For 12 oligonucleotides, the concentration of the pool of oligonucleotides is 34.8 nM, but each individual oligonucleotide is at 2.9 nM.\nNimblegen blocking oligonucleotides\nResuspend Nimblegen oligonucleotides according to the Nimblegen protocol:\n1. Spin down tubes in minifuge.\n2. Add 120 \u03bcl PCR grade water to the HE Univeral Oligo tube; vortex and spin briefly.\n3. Add 10 \u03bcl PCR grade water to the HE Index Oligo tube; vortex and spin briefly.\n4. Add 480 \u03bcl PCR grade water to the Post-LM-PCR Oligos; vortex and spin briefly.\nMultiplexing of samples\n1. Mix 1-2 \u03bcg of differentially indexed samples at exactly 1:1 ratios by mass to generate a multiplexed library.\nII. Hybridization I\nNote: If multiplexing, generate the number of parallel capture reactions equivalent to the number of pooled libraries.\n1. Heat vacuum centrifuge to 50\u00b0C.\n2. Prepare hybridization reaction for the number of pooled libraries \u2013 up to 6 libraries are captured in a single tube. For more libraries, a master mix may be made in one tube and divided into multiple tubes.\n\u2022 5 \u03bcg COT DNA\u00a0(5 \u03bcl of stock) per library\n\u2022 1 nmol TS-HE Universal Oligo\u00a0(1 \u03bcl of 1 mM stock aliquot) per library\n\u2022 1 nmol of TS-HE Index Oligos\u00a0(1 \u03bcl of 1 mM stock for each index) per library\n\u2022 1-2 \u03bcg of each uniquely indexed 3C library in 1:1 ratio by mass\n3. Vacuum centrifuge at 50\u00baC with tube lids open\u00a0(rather than pierced) until sample is completely dry. Avoid drying for a long time after liquid is gone.\n4. For each library in the capture reaction add:\n\u2022 7.5 \u03bcl 2x Hybridization Buffer\u00a0(vial 5)\n\u2022 3 \u03bcl Hybridization Component A\u00a0(vial 6)\n5. Carefully reconstitute the DNA by pipetting and vortexing followed by briefly spinning down.\n6. Replace buffers and blocking oligonucleotides in freezer prior to proceeding.\n7. Pre-warm a thermomixer to 95\u00b0C.\n8. Pre-warm a thermocycler to 47\u00b0C, lid should be heated to 57\u00b0C.\n9. Heat 4.5 \u03bcl per library of pooled biotinylated oligonucleotide probes to 47\u00b0C in a PCR tube.\nNote: The capture will be at 47\u00baC for ~72 hours. A high-quality PCR tube is required to avoid sample loss through evaporation.\n10. Denature the 3C library mix by heating to 95\u00b0C for 10 min on the thermomixer.\n11. After 10 min, quickly spin the denatured library on a minifuge and replace on the thermomixer.\n12. Without removing the heated biotinylated oligonucleotide capture probes from the thermocycler, add the entire 3C library mix\u00a0(10.5 \u00b5l per library).\n13. Mix and spin briefly before replacing in the 47\u00b0C thermocycler for 64-72h.\nIII. Washing and recovery of captured material\nNotes:\nA) Heat reagents on a thermomixer as it is more reliable than a water bath and allows the samples to be shaken.\nB) For capture of multiplexed libraries, scale the beads and wash buffers accordingly to the number of libraries.\nC) The Stringent Wash buffer, Wash Buffer I and Bead Wash Buffer are quite voluminous and may need to be made in multiple tubes. Split Wash Buffer I 1:2 as one third is heated.\n1. Dilute the wash buffers as per table below which allows slight excess of each. a. Place the Stringent Wash Buffer at 47\u00b0C on the thermomixer.\nb. Place 100 \u03bcl Wash Buffer I per captured library with an additional 20 \u03bcl\u00a0(to allow for evaporation) at 47\u00b0C on the thermomixer.\nSee figure in Figures section.\nNote: The streptavidin beads will likely stick to the interior of the tube. This is particularly a problem with some makes of low bind tubes. Use tubes with minimal adhesion. We use Safeseal tubes\u00a0(Sorenson) for this step.\n2. Prepare the streptavidin beads\u00a0(M270):\na. Allow the beads to heat to RT for 30 min prior to use.\nb. Aliquot 100 \u03bcl per captured library into a single 1.5 ml microtubef.\nc. Place on DynaMag and remove liquid once clear.\nd. Add 200 \u03bcl of 1x Bead Wash Buffer per captured library and vortex to resuspend the beads, spin briefly.\ne. Replace on DynaMag for 5 minutes and remove liquid once clear.\nf. Repeat wash steps\u00a0(d-e) for a total of two washes.\ng. Resuspend the beads in to their original volume\u00a0(i.e. 100 \u03bcl per captured library) with Bead Wash Buffer\u00a0(x1) and aliquot into appropriate number of 1.5 ml Sorensen tubes.\nh. Place in the DynaMag, remove and discard the liquid only when ready to add the capture sample from the thermocycler. Do not allow beads to dry out.\n3. Binding of biotinylated oligonucleotides:\na. Transfer the hybridization reactions to the streptavidin beads and mix thoroughly by pipetting 10 times.\nb. Spin briefly if necessary to pool all of the sample in the bottom of the tube.\nc. Place on thermomixer at 47\u00b0C 600 rpm for 45 min. Mix the beads with a pipette every 15 minutes to avoid beads settling at the bottom of the tube.\nNote: Steps 4a\u2013g should be done quickly to maintain the temperature at 47\u00baC.\n4. Washing the streptavidin beads and bound DNA:\na. Add 100 \u03bcl of heated\u00a0(47\u00b0C) Wash Buffer I per captured library to the beads and bound DNA.\nb. Mix by vortexing.\nc. Place in the Dynamag, carefully discard all the supernatant when clear.\nd. Remove from Dynamag, add 200 \u03bcl heated\u00a0(47\u00b0C) Stringent Wash buffer per captured library and mix.\ne. Incubate for 5 mins at 47\u00b0C.\nf. Place the tubes in the DynaMag, carefully discard the supernatant when clear.\ng. Repeat stringent wash\u00a0(d-f) for a total of 2 washes.\nh. Remove from Dynamag, add 200 \u03bcl Wash Buffer I\u00a0(x1) at RT per captured library and mix by vortexing for 2 minutes. Spin briefly to ensure no sample is lost in the lid.\ni. Place the tubes in the DynaMag, carefully discard the supernatant when clear.\nj. Remove from Dynamag, add 200 \u03bcl Wash Buffer II\u00a0(x1) per captured library and mix by vortexing for 1 minute. Spin briefly to ensure no sample is lost in the lid.\nk. Place the tubes in the DynaMag, carefully discard the supernatant when clear.\nl. Remove from Dynamag, add 200 \u03bcl Wash Buffer III\u00a0(x1) and mix by vortexing for 30 seconds. Spin briefly to ensure no sample is lost in the lid.\nm. Place the tubes in the DynaMag, carefully discard the supernatant when clear.\nn. Remove from DynaMag and resuspend beads in 40 \u03bcl PCR grade water per capture library. Do not discard beads \u2013 DNA is not eluted but amplified off the beads.\no. Store at -20\u00baC or proceed to PCR amplification.\n[SAFE STOPPING POINT \u2013 Store at -20\u00baC]\nIV. PCR amplification of captured material\n1. Amplify the captured fragments in two separate reactions per captured library.\nSee figure in Figures section.\nNote: Only use 20 \u03bcl of DNA/bead mix \u2013 using 40 \u03bcl has the potential to inhibit the reaction. Two separate PCR reactions can be performed simultaneously or alternatively 20 \u03bcl can be stored at -20\u00baC.\n2. Ampure XP SPRI bead clean up:\na. Transfer reaction to a 1.5 ml microtube.\nb. Add 90 \u03bcl beads per reaction, pipette up and down 10 times, allow to bind at RT for 5 min.\nc. Place on Dynamag, discard liquid when clear.\nd. Add 500 \u03bcl of fresh 80% ethanol without removing from Dynamag. Avoid disturbing beads by running the ethanol down the front of tube. Allow to sit on Dynamag for 30 sec at RT, then remove ethanol.\ne. Add another 500 \u03bcl of fresh 80% ethanol, allow to sit for 30 sec at RT and remove all the ethanol.\nf. Spin down on microfuge and replace on Dynamag. Remove residual ethanol with a P10 pipette, taking care not to remove any beads.\ng. Air dry at room temperature on stand until matt in appearance. Be careful not to over dry the beads as this will result in increased DNA losses.\nh. Remove from Dynamag and re-suspend beads in 53 \u03bcl PCR grade water. Mix by pipetting 10 times.\ni. Incubate at RT for 2 min to elute.\nj. Replace on Dynamag. Once clear, recover 51 \u00b5l in a PCR tube.\n3. Run 1 \u00b5l in TapeStation to confirm same profile as input material\u00a0(Appendix).\n4. Repeat amplification on the remainder of the beads.\n5. Pool amplifications.\n6. Quantify with Qubit BR Kit.\n[SAFE STOPPING POINT \u2013 Store at -20\u00baC]\nV. Hybridization II\nNote: Capture enrichment efficiency is improved by 100-1000 fold by performing a second capture step.\n1. Pool amplified material of the parallel PCR reactions.\n2. Prepared the second capture hybridization reaction using all captured material\u00a0(up to 2 \u03bcg) in a single reaction. Combine:\n\u2022 5 \u03bcg COT DNA\u00a0(5 \u03bcl of stock)\n\u2022 1 nmol TS-HE Universal Oligo\u00a0(1 \u03bcl of 1 mM stock aliquot)\n\u2022 1 nmol of TS-HE Index Oligos\u00a0(1 \u03bcl of 1 mM stock in total; so if you have 4 samples, use 0.25 \u03bcl of each index for a total of 1 \u03bcl; consider making a dilution if you have many samples)\n\u2022 Up to 2 \u03bcg of amplified captured material\n3. Perform hybridization, washes, and amplification as described with a 24-hour hybridization at 47\u00b0C and treating the material as a single library.\n[SAFE STOPPING POINT \u2013 Store at -20\u00baC]\nVI. Library quantification and sequencing\n1. Use the KAPA Library Quantification Kit to calculate the concentration of adaptor containing fragments and dilute Tri-C libraries to 4 nM.\n2. Sequence using at least 300 cycles of Illumina paired-end sequencing."

Tri-C allows for multiplexing both viewpoints and samples. As identification of multi-way interactions relies on Illumina sequencing, data can be generated at great depth and PCR duplicates \\(based on identical sonication ends) can accurately be removed, allowing for high-throughput, quantitative analysis of multi-way chromatin interactions.",
