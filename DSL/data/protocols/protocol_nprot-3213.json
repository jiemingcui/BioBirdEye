            "content": "Mutations that activate the Wnt signaling pathway are the most common cause of colorectal cancer initiation \\(1). High nuclear concentrations of \u03b2-catenin, the main effector of the canonical Wnt signaling, has been associated with higher stages of the disease and shorter survival of the patients \\(2). Tissue immunohistochemistry is widely used in clinical pathology to characterize and classify tissue samples of patients. However, in many cases this procedure relies on subjective qualitative criteria. We already described a method for relative quantification of immunofluorescence staining of tumor tissue sections \\(3). However, in the case of proteins such as \u03b2-catenin, that can be located in several sub-cellular compartments \\(affecting its functions), it is interesting to correctly differentiate each pool. Based on the strategy proposed by Camp RL et al. \\(4), we have improved our previous procedure using ImageJ software \\(5) and combining the staining of \u03b2-catenin with alpha-catenin, a well characterized interactor that is almost only found in the membrane of the cells \\(forming a complex with \u03b2-catenin and E-Cadherin at the adherent junctions). Staining for both proteins at the same time offer the possibility to distinguish which fluorescent signal comes from the nucleus and which from the plasma membrane. This procedure, which is more accurate than the one we had described before, can be generalized in order to analyze the nuclear amounts of proteins of interest in tissue samples."

Stain \u03b2-catenin in red, alpha-catenin in green and counterstain the nuclei with Hoechst 33342.\r\n  2. Take standard confocal images \\(at least five frames for each sample).\r\n  3. Perform immunofluorescence quantification using ImageJ software as detailed as follows:\r\n  \u2022 Define Regions of Interest \\(ROI, see Fig. 1) using the Polygon or the Freehand selection tool, delimiting tumor tissue from stroma or adjacent regions.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Split the image into the three color channels \\(RGB Merge/split function) to obtain one image per channel.\r\n\n\n\u2022 To determine the average number of cells present in the previously defined ROI, use the Measure option in the program\u2019s ROI Manager, to assess the integrated density value \\(IDV) for the blue channel \\(Hoechst 33342). \r\n\n\n\u2022 Using the Elliptical selection tool mark at least ten representative nuclei, covering the different sizes and intensities throughout the ROI. Then determine the IDV for all the selected nuclei and calculate the mean nucleus value.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Divide the blue channel IDV by the mean nucleus value. The resulting value corresponds to the average number of cells present in each respective ROI.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Next, to avoid quantifying the membrane signal of \u03b2-catenin, the signal that colocalize between \u03b2- and alpha-catenin is substracted. For that, open the Image calculator from the Process menu and create a new image using the operator Substract \\(Image1: \u03b2-catenin, Image 2: alpha-catenin).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Create a merged image combining the substracted image with the blue channel image using the operator AND. The merged picture shows nuclear localized \u03b2-catenin.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Measure the IDV of the respective ROI in this newly created merged image and divide it by the average number of cells calculated before. This represents the \u03b2-catenin content per nucleus.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Represent the obtained values in scattered plots representing the level of expression for each protein per cell nucleus analyzed, noted as relative units \\(r. u.) indicating mean and 95% confidence interval.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Do suitable statistics, such as the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test that is used to compare three or more groups of unpaired values that did not follow any particular distribution. Thereby, Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison post-test serves to identify the significance \\(P value)of differences in the sum of ranks between each pair of groups of values."
