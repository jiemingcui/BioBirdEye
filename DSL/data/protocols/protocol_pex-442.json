            "content": "<p>When population density and nutrient availability are optimal, planarians begin to exponentially increase their numbers via an asexual reproductive behavior known as fission. During fission, planarians mechanically break off a portion of posterior tissue which will go on to regenerate into a clonal progeny. This animal behavior has been linked to size and yields an easily scoreable functional output. However, the infrequency of fission behavior under standard laboratory conditions has precluded its mechanistic dissection. By optimizing husbandry techniques of the planarian <em>Schmidtea mediterranea,</em> we developed a protocol that elicits a robust and rapid induction of fission behavior.</p>"

Planarian water flows from the sump pump through a chiller, canister filter, and a UV sterilizer into the top tray. Water subsequently flows down drains at the opposite ends of the source through the series of three trays. Water then re-enters the sump where it is filtered through two vertically stacked 400\u03bcm and 200\u03bcm sieves. Beyond the sieves, water is gravity fed and mechanically filtered through a set of filter/floss pads. Finally, water passes through Water Garden Oasis Pond Matrix and Kaldness media to remove nitrogenous waste. Water is then able to flow back through the chiller, canister filter, and UV sterilizer back into the top tray (Fig 1).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sanyo MIR-553 Refrigerated Incubator</strong></p>"

Sick planarians exhibit a lack of appetite, dorsal tissue lesions, and head regression. Healthy planarians will consume large amounts of beef liver, grow at a steady rate, and show no visible signs of tissue degeneration. Optimize planarian health prior to fission induction and avoid culturing worms at high density following removal from the recirculation culutre system. Animals are most susceptible to tissue degeneration following removal from the recirculation culture system due to expansion of endogenous pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, culture in antibiotics, such as Gentamycin, can also reduce fission rate.</p>"

During fission, planarians mechanically break off a portion of posterior tissue which will go on to regenerate into a clonal progeny. By optimizing husbandry techniques of the planarian <em>Schmidtea mediterranea,</em> we developed a protocol that robustly induces fission behavior. This technique permits the investigation of the effects of different experimental perturbations on planarian fission. Using visual scoring, successful fissions can be scored daily by counting fission progeny. While this protocol only measures successful fissions, constant video recording permits the measurement of unsuccessful fission attempts as well. The protocol consists of the optimal husbandry of worms, transfer of animals to dishes, and scoring of animal fissions over a 2-week period.</p>",
