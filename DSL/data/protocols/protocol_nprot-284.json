Total CD4+ T cells were isolated using the CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit II from Miltenyi Biotec: \r\n  - Total PBMC were resuspended in 40\u00b5l of MACS buffer \\(PBS 0.5% BSA 2mM EDTA) per 10 cells, and incubated with 10 \u00b5l of Biotin-Antibody cocktail per 10 cells for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. \r\n\n\n-. Subsequently, 30 \u00b5l of MACS buffer per 10 cells was added, and cells were incubated with 20 \u00b5l of Anti-Biotin Microbeads per 10 cells for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. \r\n\n\n- Cells were washed with MACS buffer and resuspended up to 10 cells in 500\u00b5l of MACS buffer.\r\n\n\n- CD4+ T cells were sorted by two rounds of magnetic depletion on the AutoMACS \\(program Deplete S).\r\n\n\n3. CD4+ T cells \\(negative fraction) were washed with MACS buffer and resuspended in 80\u00b5l of MACS buffer per 10 cells. Then, 20\u00b5l of CD45RO microbeads per 10 cells was added for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Na\u00efve CD45RO- T cells were isolated by two rounds of depletion on the AutoMACS \\(as in step 2.).\r\n  4. Na\u00efve CD4+ CD45RO- T cells were cultured at 1 \u00d7 10 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottom plates or 5 \u00d7 10 cells/well in 24-well plates \\(Falcon) for 5-6 days in Yssel\u2019s medium containing 1% human AB serum \\(Gemini Bio Products) with the appropriate cytokines and beads coated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and anti-CD2 antibodies \\(T Cell Activation/Expansion Kit, Miltenyi Biotec) \\(1 bead/10 cells).\r\n  5. After 5-6 days, cells were collected, counted, washed and cultured at 1 \u00d7 10 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottom plates or 5 \u00d7 10 cells/well in 24-well plates for an additional period of 5-6 days in the presence of the indicated cytokines and IL-2. \r\n  6. After 10-12 days of culture, cells were counted and stimulated at 5 \u00d7 10 cells/ml with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and anti-CD2 antibodies in the presence of IL-2 for 24 h to analyze gene expression or 48 h to assess cytokine level in cell-free supernatants."
