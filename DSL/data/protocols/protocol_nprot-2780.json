Intense research is underway to develop new sensing materials and devices for a wide range of applications, especially, at room temperature."

The optical micrograph of the film with the electrical leads on a flexible substrate is shown in Fig. 1a. Electrical measurements were taken with an Agilent SMU as voltage-source and current-meter. \r\n\n\ni) Electrical conductivity of GG film, film I & II were carried out and it was found to be 8.45x10-9, 1.7x10-5 and 1.84x10-5 \u2126-1cm-1, respectively. This clearly indicates that the conductivity of the films can be enhanced by increasing the loading of Ag nanoparticles in GG. \r\n\n\nj) XPS and field-effect transistor \\(FET) analysis has been carried out in order to confirm the sensing mechanism. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSensor measurements\r\n\n\na) Upon exposure to aqueous ammonia of different concentrations, the conductivity of GG/Ag nanocomposite film is found to increase which prompted us to explore the film as chemiresistor sensors and investigate the underlying mechanism. An Agilent SMU was used to study the temporal response behaviour. \r\n\n\nb) Aqueous ammonia sensing experiments were carried out in a simple home-made testing chamber whose net volume  ~800 cm3 \\(10 cm  x 10 cm x 8 cm) as shown schematically in Fig. 1b. \r\n\n\nc) The ammonia vapors of different concentrations were introduced into the testing chamber manually at the humidity of ~48% and temperature of 20-25 0C. The distance of ammonia solution from sensor film is kept 1 cm. \r\n\n\nd) In order to understand the sensing mechanism, we have carried out sensing experiments under different environmental conditions \\(ambient, oxygen and nitrogen) and studied the field effect transistor \\(FET) characteristics of the sensing film on a Si/SiO2 \\(300 nm thickness) substrate.\r\n\n\ne) The kinetics of a chemical reaction such as generation of ammonia from hexamethylenetetramine \\(HMT) in water at different temperatures is studied by the sensing film. Similarly in another experiment, the evolution of ammonia from the reaction between ammonium chloride and sodium hydroxide has been investigated."

It is found that the sensing of ammonia is only possible in presence of oxygen \\(Fig. 2). \r\n\n\n\\(3) It is observed that only GG cannot sense ammonia. \r\n\n\n\\(4) A sensing mechanism for the ammonia detection has been established which can also be applicable for other reducing analytes such as hydrogen, methane, etc. \r\n\n\n\\(5) The main advantages of the sensor are its operation at room temperature over the wide range and working under ambient environment. Apart from this, the sensor does not require any external stimulus for response/recovery. \r\n\n\n\\(6) The sensitivity, reversibility, stability and reproducibility of the sensors are superior as compared to the sensors reported in the literature. \r\n\n\n\\(7) The conductance change is ~600 for a concentration of 1300 ppm.\r\n\n\n\\(8)  It has also been demonstrated that the sensor can be used for the investigation of ammonia evolution from chemical reactions such as hexamethylenetetramine with boiled water or ammonium chloride with alkali \\(Fig. 3). \r\n\n\n\\(9) One of the most important advantages of the sensor is the change in current in \uf06dA range which can even be detected by a multimeter without using sophisticated source-measure-unit. \r\n\n\n\\(10) The overall paramount performance of the sensor can conveniently be fixed into portable hand-held devices and could be deployed for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, industrial applications such as in chemical processing plants, and homeland security for counter-terrorism, and leak detection in research laboratories."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Room temperature operation, low detection limit and fast response time are highly desirable for a wide range of gas sensing applications. However, the available gas sensors suffer mainly from high temperature operation or external stimulation for response/recovery. Here, we report an ultrasensitive-flexible-silver-nanoparticle based nanocomposite resistive sensor for ammonia detection and established the sensing mechanism. We show that the nanocomposite can detect ammonia as low as 500 parts-per-trillion at room temperature in a minute time. Furthermore, the evolution of ammonia from different chemical reactions has been demonstrated using the nanocomposite sensor. Our results demonstrate the proof-of-concept for the new detector to be used in several applications including homeland security, environmental pollution and leak detection in research laboratories and many others.",
