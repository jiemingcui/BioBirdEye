Culture the hESCs for at least two passages post-thawing before refreezing (See\nFreezing hESCs\nsection for more information).\u00a0Only maintain hESCs\nin vitro\nfor up to six passages post-thawing, for efficient gastruloid generation.

To do so, minimise any pipetting and ensure exposure of cells to EDTA is just enough to dislodge cells without disrupting clusters.\n7.\nOptional\n:\na)\u00a0Collect cells using a P1000 and transfer to a 15 mL falcon tube containing 8 mL PBS-/-.\nb)\u00a0Centrifuge cell suspension at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes, remove supernatant, and resuspend in 1 mL fresh Nutristem.\nc)\nNote\n: perform this step carefully so as not to disrupt cell clusters.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plate cells in 3 mL of Nutristem per well of a vitronectin-coated 6-well plate, at between 1:4 to 1:20, depending on original cell density and cluster size.\nNote:\nWe typically passage our cultures 1:10 every 3-4 days, but ideal conditions may vary and may require optimisation for different cell lines depending on growth rate.\u00a0Passaging concentration can be assessed by visual examination of cluster size after dislodging with EDTA (Step 3) and from pellet size after centrifugation (Step 7). Aim for fairly sparse, medium-sized clusters covering ~10% of the well.\nGenerating Human Gastruloids\nThe successful generation of human gastruloids requires three sequential steps, each of which needs to be carefully monitored: 1) the state of the cells at the start the protocol, 2) the Chiron pre-treatment and 3) aggregate formation.\nThe first, includes dependency on colony density, size and morphology. In order to achieve this state, cells can be routinely passaged and monitored so that pre-treatment is performed when cells achieve this culture state (Option 1, below). This option is the version used in the associated manuscript (Moris et. al., 2020) and the resulting gastruloids have been extensively characterised. It does not use ROCK inhibitor to alter the state of the cells, and instead utilises passaging as clusters of cells. Alternatively, we have found that cells can be seeded as a single-cell suspension before pre-treatment to standardise this starting state (Option 2, below). In our hands, this can improve reproducibility between experimentalists by providing a standardised culture method, although this requires ROCK inhibition.\nOption 1: Routine passaging of hESCs before pre-treatment (~3-5 days before pre-treatment)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissociate and passage cells as described in the section describing hESC passaging.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Closely monitor cells daily to determine the correct timepoint to perform pre-treatment.\nNote:\nCell density is critical for human gastruloid generation. Cells should be at ~60% confluency on the day of aggregation, so for pre-treatment 24 hours before, cells should be at ~40-50% confluency (see Figure 1). Typically, this state is reached 3-4 days after passaging.\nNote:\nColony size is critical for human gastruloid generation. Ensure colonies are of medium size (not so large that they are touching each other, and not so small that they do not contain many cells). The optimal diameter of each colony is ~150-300 \u00b5m on the day of pre-treatment. See Figure 2.\nNote:\nWe have observed that cell morphology at the time of pre-treatment is a critical feature for human gastruloid generation. Cells around the edges of colonies should often appear \u2018pointy\u2019 before pre-treatment, and colonies should not yet have defined edges.\nOption 2: Single-cell seeding of hESCs before pre-treatment (4 days before pre-treatment)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare vitronectin-coated wells of a 6-well plate by putting 0.5 \u00b5g/cm\n2\nvitronectin in PBS-/- into the wells. Leave at room temperature for 1 hour before plating, or for longer periods at 4\u00b0C wrapped with parafilm.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare replating medium, which is Nutristem supplemented with 1:2000 ROCK inhibitor.\nNote:\nWhile ROCK inhibitor is not used for routine passaging, it is critically important for survival when hESC cells are plated as a single-cell suspension.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash cells once with 3 mL PBS-/- per well of a 6-well plate.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 2 mL of room-temperature 0.5 mM EDTA per well of a 6-well plate.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place in the incubator for 4.5 minutes before gently tapping against a solid surface to dislodge the cells.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissociate the colonies into a single cell suspension with a P1000 micropipette tip by pipetting up-and-down 5-10 times and ejecting the suspension forcefully against the bottom of the well.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collect cells using a P1000 and then transfer to a 15 mL falcon tube with 8 mL PBS-/-.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge cell suspension at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove supernatant and fully resuspend in 200-1000 \u00b5L of Nutristem depending on pellet size.\n10.\u00a0Check under dissection microscope that the cells are in a single-cell suspension.\n11.\u00a0Count cells using an automated cell counter or haematocytometer.\n12.\u00a0For each well of a 6-well plate, add 60,000 to 80,000 cells to 3 mL of room-temperature replating medium.\nNote\n: The exact cell number to replate depends on cell line and growth speeds. If using a new line, this number should be tested empirically, but in our hands, 60,000 cells per 3 cm well works well with most lines.\n13.\u00a0Remove vitronectin coating from the 6-well plate, and add cell suspension to well\n14.\u00a0Place cells in the incubator. Cells should be left to grow for 4 days (with fresh Nutristem exchange daily) before pre-treatment.\nPre-treatment of hPSCs (24h before aggregation)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare Nutristem supplemented with between 3-3.5 \u00b5M Chiron, depending on cell line. An ideal concentration in our hands is 3.25 \u00b5M, but this is particularly cell line dependent.\nNote:\nWith each new cell line, optimise the Chiron concentration by performing titration experiments.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate Nutristem medium from cells and replace with Chiron-supplemented medium.\na.\nOptional:\nMaintain one well in Nutristem alone for routine maintenance of the cell line.\nPreparation\nof Gastruloids (0h after aggregation)\nNote:\nFollowing pre-treatment with Chiron, cell colonies should look less \u2018spiky\u2019 at the edges, and more rounded (see Figure 3). If this is not the case, consider titrating Chiron concentration further, or adjusting starting cell attributes like density and colony size.\nNote:\nDissociation and reaggregation of hPSCs should be done as quickly as possible to minimise the stress caused to the cells. We recommend that any separate samples are performed independently to ensure a quick process, which should ideally be completed in < 30 minutes.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pre-warm EDTA and E6 to room temperature\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare aggregation medium, by supplementing E6 with 0.5-3 \u00b5M Chiron (routinely 0.5 \u00b5M Chiron, but titrate for new cell lines) and 1:2000 ROCK inhibitor. For each 96-well plate of aggregates, prepare 5 mL of aggregation medium.\nNote:\nThis concentration of ROCK inhibitor is half the concentration used for routinely replating single cells. We have found this to be a sufficient concentration for aggregate formation. With new cell lines, consider titrating this concentration to 1:1000 if aggregation is poor.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the medium from the 6-well plate and rinse gently with 3 mL PBS-/-.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the PBS and add 2 mL of pre-warmed 0.5 mM EDTA.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place in the incubator for 4.5 minutes before gently tapping against a solid surface to dislodge the cells.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissociate the colonies into a single cell suspension with a P1000 micropipette tip by pipetting up-and-down 5-10 times and ejecting the suspension forcefully against the bottom of the well.\nNote:\nA single cell suspension is essential for accurate cell counting. Errors in counting affect the size of the gastruloids, which is known to affect the level of axial elongation in mouse gastruloids (see Baillie-Johnson et. al., 2015). Observe cell suspension under an inverted benchtop microscope to check single cell suspension. Cell suspension can be passed through a filter if necessary.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collect cells using a P1000 and then transfer to a 15 mL falcon tube with 8 mL PBS-/-.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge cell suspension at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove supernatant and fully resuspend in 200-1000 \u00b5L of E6 depending on pellet size. One well of a 6-well plate at 60-80% confluence should typically be suspended in 200 \u00b5L E6.\n10.\u00a0Load the counting slide of an automated cell counter (or equivalent haemocytometer) with 75 \u00b5L of cell suspension and determine the density of the suspension.\nNote:\nAccurate counting of cell numbers is necessary to achieve reproducible aggregates between experiments, so automated and highly accurate equipment is strongly recommended.\nNote:\nIf your cell counter allows, check that the amount of debris in your suspension is minimal. With our Moxi Orflo cell counter, we aim for a Moxi Population Index (MPI) of > 0.7 (ratio of cell population relative to debris and contaminants).\n11.\u00a0Determine the volume of suspension required to produce a cell concentration of 10-20 cells/\u00b5L of aggregation medium.\nNote\n: This cell concentration will determine the number of cells aggregated as gastruloids. In our hands, between 300-800 cells works well, with an optimum of 400 cells, but this is particularly cell line dependent and should be optimised empirically for each new cell line.\n12.\u00a0Add the calculated volume of cell suspension to the required amount of aggregation medium (see Step 2), mix well and transfer to a sterile reservoir.\na.\nTip:\nInverting the suspension prior to plating or pipetting it up and down within the reservoir can ensure that the cells are well mixed.\n13.\u00a0Pipette 40 \u00b5L of plating suspension into each well of a sterile, U-bottomed non-tissue culture-treated 96-well plate with a multichannel micropipette.\na.\nTip:\nTake care to position the droplets in the bottom of each well and not clinging to the walls, as U-shaped droplets are required for efficient aggregation.\n14.\u00a0Confirm that cells can be seen within each well using the inverted benchtop microscope.\n15.\u00a0Centrifuge the plates using a plate centrifuge at 700 rpm for 2 minutes at room temperature.\na.\nTip:\nWrap the plate in parafilm before centrifugation to prevent accidental lid opening and maintain sterility.\n16.\u00a0Return the plate to the incubator for 24 hours to allow aggregation.\nAddition of Medium (24 hours after aggregation)\nNote:\nAdding fresh E6 medium to the aggregates 24 hours after aggregation is necessary to dilute both the Chiron and ROCK inhibitor from the aggregation medium.\n17.\u00a0Pre-warm E6 medium to room temperature.\n18.\u00a0Transfer 150 \u00b5L of E6 medium to each well using the multichannel micropipette and a sterile plastic reservoir.\n19.\u00a0Return the plate to the incubator for a further 24 hours.\nExchange of Medium (48 hours after aggregation)\n20.\u00a0Pre-warm E6 medium to room temperature.\n21.\u00a0Carefully remove 150 \u00b5L of the medium from each well using the multichannel micropipette, holding it at an angle to aspirate slowly from the side of each well.\na.\nTip\n: Angle the pipette at an acute angle at the beginning of suction, rotating your wrist to become more vertical as suctioning progresses. This will ensure that the tip of your pipette is always at the top of the medium and not likely to accidently disturb/remove the gastruloid (see Figure 4).\n22.\u00a0Add 150 \u00b5L of fresh E6 to each well using the multichannel micropipette.\n23.\u00a0Return the plate to the incubator.\n24.\u00a0Repeat steps 20-23 each day for the extent of the protocol."

A brief overview of human gastruloid development is detailed below:</p><p>Within 0-2 hours after plating, the single-cell suspension in the 96-well plate should form one coherent aggregate, with each cell in close physical contact with its neighbours.</p><p>Within the first 24 hours, these aggregates should have assumed an initially spherical shape, with clearly defined edges. Shortly after this point, the aggregates polarise their gene expression (SOX2 becomes localised to one region of the aggregate) and the aggregate assumes an ovoid shape.</p><p>At the 48 hour time point, the aggregates should have increased in size slightly, and should be beginning to become elongated. It should be clear from this timepoint onwards that one end of the elongated ovoid is slightly wider and darker than the other, which is more transparent; these are the anterior and posterior axis locations, respectively.</p><p>At the 72 hour time point, most aggregates should have assumed a clearly elongated shape, with a single long extension. For optimal conditions, at least 60% of aggregates should have elongated by this timepoint.</p><p>At the 96 hour time point, many of the gastruloid extensions will have either curled back on themselves, or appear to have been retracted. Many of the gastruloids will therefore assume a more spherical shape.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond this point, aggregates continue to grow radially but without a clear anterior-posterior morphological axis.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Gastruloids are aggregates of Pluripotent Stem Cells (PSCs) which, when exposed to differentiation medium and plated within defined conditions, undergo trilineage differentiation to all three germ layers (mesoderm, ectoderm and endoderm) with constitutive cell types organised spatiotemporally along 3 axes (Becarri et. al. 2018). They also undergo morphological shape changes including axial elongation through convergent extension cell movements. The gastruloid method has been well-established using mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs) and mouse induced PSCs (iPSCs) (van den Brink et. al., 2014; Turner et. al. 2016a; Turner et. al. 2016b; Bailie-Johnson et. al. 2015; Turner et. al. 2017a; Turner et. al. 2017b, Beccari et. al., 2018, See method in Girgin et. al., 2018). Here, we describe a new method to generate equivalent gastruloids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs).&nbsp;hPSCs are able to generate axially elongated human gastruloids with evidence of spatially organised germ layers and comparable features to their mouse counterparts (Moris et. al., 2020).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
