            "content": "Three-dimensional \\(3D) organoid culture technology allows the development of complex, organ-like tissues reminiscent of in vivo development\\(Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014a). The cerebral organoid method\\(Lancaster et al., 2013) is capable of producing many different brain regions. However, as it relies on intrinsic patterning, the production of some regions is variable and infrequent\\(Renner et al., 2017). Alternative cerebral organoid protocols utilize exogenous drug-patterning to produce more homogenous cerebral organoid tissue\\(Qian et al., 2016). The current protocol builds upon these previous cerebral organoid methods to produce a reliable combination of multiple, defined brain regions within a single cerebral organoid tissue. Our approach is based upon classical co-culture methodology. By embedding independently patterned embryoid bodies \\(EBs) in a 3D matrix of matrigel, dorsal and ventral forebrain-like tissues can be \u201cfused\u201d together. Although we have produced dorsal-ventral forebrain fusions, any combination of cerebral organoids representing various brain regional identities should be feasible. Therefore, this approach is versatile with respect to the desired tissue to be engineered. \r\n\n\nMany fundamental aspects of this protocol are based on previous protocols. The culture of stem cells and generation of cerebral organoids are based on the original cerebral organoid method \\(Lancaster et al., 2013; Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014b). The small-molecule drug-patterning treatments are based on various 2D and 3D neural differentiation protocols\\(Liu et al., 2013; Maroof et al., 2013; Nicholas et al., 2013) \\(Kadoshima et al., 2013; Vazin et al., 2014; Pa\u015fca et al., 2015). These previous protocols were adapted and combined to develop a method for cerebral organoid fusion."

Create a master mix by combining all the cells required for the total number of wells required for a given experiment. For example, to account for pipet error, calculate 100 wells per 96 well plate: Combine 900,000 live cells in 15 mL media, then pipet 150 \u00b5L of this solution into each well using a p200 pipetman or multichannel pipet. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 3\r\n\n\n4) Exchange the media by removing ~75% of the media in each well and adding 150 \u00b5L of fresh hES media \\(without bFGF or RI). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 5, Neural induction and brain regional patterning\r\n\n\n5) When EBs are >500 \u00b5m in diameter, remove ~75% of the media and replace with neural induction \\(NI) media, containing no small molecules or small molecule patterning treatments depending on the desired dorsal/ventral forebrain identity of the resulting tissue. For stabilizing a dorsal identity, add 1:1000 cyclopamine A \\(CycA) stock. To promote a ventral identity, add 1:10,000 SAG stock and 1:2000 IWP2 stock. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDays 7, 9, and 11\r\n\n\n6) Exchange the media by removing ~75% of the media in each well and adding 150 \u00b5L of fresh NI media containing the desired small molecule patterning treatments. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nQuality control: EBs that grow irregular, non-circular/elliptical shapes or fail to generate an expanded radialized neuroepithelium \\(Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014b) should be discarded. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 12, Embedding EBs together in matrigel for organoid fusion\r\n\n\n7) Thaw matrigel on ice, and maintain on ice throughout the embedding procedure.\r\n\n\n8) Transfer EBs from the 96-well U-bottom plate into a 6cm Eppendorf cell culture dish containing 3 mL of Differentiation medium \\(- Vit. A) using a p200 with a widened tip cut with scissors. Separate the EBs patterned into either dorsal or ventral tissues into different cell culture dishes.\r\n\n\n9) Prepare parafilm wells by pressing a piece of parafilm onto the top of an empty p200 pipet tip box. Transfer the sheet of parafilm wells to a cell culture dish. For 8-10 wells use a 6 cm2 dish. For 20-25 wells use a 10 cm2 dish. \r\n\n\n10) Transfer 1 dorsal and 1 ventral EB into each parafilm well using a using a p200 with a widened tip. \r\n\n\n11) Carefully remove the excess media surrounding the EBs using a p200 pipetman. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCritical: Avoid aspirating the EBs into the pipet tip, as this will damage the tissue.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n12) Embed organoids in a droplet \\(\n25-30 \u00b5L) of Matrigel using a p200 pipetman. The droplet does not need to be accurately measured, but instead use 200 \u00b5l matrigel and add droplets to\n8 parafilm wells of EBs. The droplet is best formed by placing the pipet tip against the bottom of the parafilm well next to the EBs so that the droplet forms around the 2 EBs from the bottom up.\r\n\n\n13) Before the matrigel droplet solidifies, gently position the EBs in the middle of the matrigel droplet and push dorsal and ventral EBs as close to each other as possible using a p200 pipet tip. \r\n\n\n14) Place the dish of embedded EBs into at 37\u00b0C incubator for 20 minutes to solidify the matrigel. \r\n\n\n15) Add differentiation medium to gently wash the embedded EBs off the parafilm. Add 6 mL of media to a 6cm dish, or 25 mL to a 10 cm dish. If the EBs remain attached to the parafilm, gently wash them from the parafilm using a p1000 pipetman. Remove the parafilm sheet and discard. \r\n\n\n16) Place the embedded EBs onto a shelf in a 37\u00b0C cell culture incubator.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 16, Differentiating cerebral organoid fusions.\r\n\n\n17) Exchange the media by first removing ~75% of the media with 2mL aspirating tip connected to a vacuum pump, and the adding fresh differentiation \\(+Vit. A) media.\r\n\n\n18) Transfer the dish to an orbital shaker in a 37\u00b0C cell culture incubator. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDays 20-40\r\n\n\n19) Exchange the media twice a week with differentiation media \\(+Vit. A).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDays 40 and later, maturation of cerebral organoid fusions.\r\n\n\n20) Add 1% thawed matrigel to ice cold differentiation media. \r\n\n\n21) Exchange the media twice a week with differentiation media \\(+Vit. A) containing 1% matrigel, and continue culturing to the desired age of collection for subsequent analyses such as immunofluorescence or gene expression as described previously \\(Lancaster et al., 2013; Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014b)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nB) Creating Organoid Fusion Slice Cultures\r\n\n\nDay 0\r\n\n\n1) Prepare 4% low melt agarose in sterile PBS. Heat the solution in a microwave, and maintain melted agarose solution while stirring on a heat block at 60-70\u02daC. \r\n\n\n2) Prior to embedding organoid fusions in agarose, transfer 1 mL aliquots in 2mL micro-centrifuge tubes of heated low-melt agarose solution into a heat-block set to 45\u02daC. \r\n\n\n3) Transfer organoid fusions of a desired age \\(usually 30-80 days old) from a cell culture dish into a tissue embedding mold using a widened p1000 tip cut with scissors and a pipetman. If the tissue is too large for the p1000 tip, a widened plastic transfer pipet cut with scissors can be used instead. \r\n\n\n4) Remove excess media surrounding the organoid fusion tissue. \r\n\n\n5) Add 1 mL of 45oC low melt agarose solution into the tissue embedding mold. Position the organoid fusion tissue in the center of the agarose, at the bottom of the tissue embedding mold. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCritical: Position the fusion tissue so that the two fusion tissue components \\(dorsal/ventral) are parallel to the base of the mold. This ensures the fusion tissue will be sliced in a way to create horizontal slices that includes continuous tisse from both components of the fusion tissue.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6) Add an additional 1-2 mL of 45\u00b0C low melt agarose solution to the mold. \r\n\n\n7) Chill the mold on a slurry of ice to quickly solidify the agarose embedded organoid fusion tissue.\r\n\n\n8) Remove the agarose embedded tissue from the mold and attach the tissue block to the tissue holder plate of the vibratome chamber using super glue. \r\n\n\n9) Fill the vibratome sectioning chamber with ice cold PBS \\(without Ca2+/Mg2+). \r\n\n\n10) Section the organoid fusion tissue into 150-250 \u00b5m sections. Use the maximum blade frequency and a slow speed \\(setting #4). \r\n\n\n11) Immediately transfer the tissue sections to a 60 mm cell culture dish containing differentiation \\(+Vit. A.) medium \\(use the same type of medium that the organoid fusions were being cultured with prior to sectioning) using a spoon and paint brush. \r\n\n\n12) When the organoid fusion is completely sectioned, visibly inspect the sections using a microscope to determine which sections contain a continuous tissue including both tissue components of the organoid fusion. Transfer these sections individually to an organotypic cell culture insert. \r\n\n\n13) Place the cell culture insert into 1 mL of differentiation medium \\(+Vit. A.) containing 5% FBS in a well of a 6-well Eppendorf cell culture plate. The FBS aids in attachment of the tissue to the cell culture insert membrane. Carefully remove any excess media from the top of the culture insert so that the tissue section does not float, but instead rests directly on top of the cell culture insert membrane. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCritical: The section should not float in media. The cell culture inserts are designed to coat the tissue in a thin layer of media by capillary action. If too much media is added on top of the tissue section, then it will float and not attach to the membrane.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 1\r\n\n\n14) Replace the media with 1 mL of differentiation medium \\(+Vit. A.) without FBS. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDays 3 and later\r\n\n\n15) Replace the media every other day until the slice cultures are desired to be collected for subsequent analyses such as immunofluorescence or live-imaging."

Between day 40 and 60 the organoid fusions usually grow larger than the matrigel droplet they were embedded within. However, at this age well after the fusion process is complete, the organoid fusions should remain intact. Throughout the entire protocol the organoid tissue should increase in size. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nB) Organoid Fusion Slice Culture\r\n\n\n Slicing a 40-60 day old organoid fusion into 200 \u00b5m slices should produce 4-6 slices containing both tissue component regions within a continuous section. The slice cultures should attach to the cell culture insert after 1-2 days."

Here, we describe a co-culture method combining various brain regions of choice within one \u201cfused\u201d organoid tissue. This organoid fusion protocol can be used to combine independently patterned or genetically manipulated organoids to allow the versatile engineering of a complex arrangement of various tissues. We also present an organoid fusion slice culture protocol suitable for time-lapse imaging and small-molecule drug-screening. This protocol accompanies Bagley et al \\(Nature Methods, published online 10 May, 2017; 10.1038/nmeth.4304).",
