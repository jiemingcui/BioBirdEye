Many general applications require a broad and comprehensive database, as in clinical, food, or environmental microbiology, as reference databases need to deal with the diversity in species. Furthermore, multiple studies have shown promising results, but standardization is lacking<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>81</sup></a>. Random variation between studies can originate from differences in instrumentation, operators, and environmental conditions.

Only a single colony in culture medium should be used for FT-IR analysis. The parameters, such as age of culture, cultivation medium, incubation time, and the preparation protocol, should be the same. Differences or changes in any of these parameters may lead to false negative results.</p><p>Bacterial sample cultivation is started from bacteria of the same age. Pure single colonies are selected for inoculation (a pure culture is essential; if only small colonies are present, an additional streak and incubation is required to increase cell mass). The cell material is spread using an inoculation loop in a way that generates confluent growth. In certain cases, subculturing (on the same medium) may be necessary in order to adapt the organism to the growth medium. The cultivation conditions, including the agar medium used, the temperature, and the incubation time, depend on the organism. These conditions must be as standardized as possible to take advantage of the high selectivity of the IR method. Anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria (e.g., lactic acid bacteria) are grown in a sealed container in the presence of an oxygen-sorbent (e.g., Anaerocult, Merck; sorbent system should be standardized).</p><p><strong>1.6.2 Instrumental parameters </strong></p><p>For FT-IR spectrometry, water vapor rotational bands are of low intrinsic half-width and their precise wavenumber position and intensities are dependent on parameters such as partial pressures or temperature. Therefore, the FT-IR spectra can be the results of environmental conditions around the instrument. To collect high-quality FT-IR spectra of bacteria, the FT-IR instrument should be placed in an enclosed space avoiding disturbance of air flow. In addition, vapor contributions should be reduced by purging the instrument with dry air or nitrogen during spectra collection. Furthermore, the particular instrument will influence the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); thus, user-specific conditions and some instrumental parameters need to be optimized. Normally, the optimal resolution of the instrument was set to 4 cm<sup>-1 </sup>or lower and the scan number to 62 scans or more. Background scans of the same sample should have the same parameters. Subsequently, the sample spectra will then undergo a background correction to result in a final spectrum.</p><p><strong>1.6.3 Spectral acquisition </strong></p><p>Further details regarding spectral acquisition using FT-IR spectroscopy can be found in our previous protocols<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>33</sup></a>.</p><p><strong>1.6.4 Spectra preprocessing</strong></p><p>Pre-processing of the spectrum is a significant issue, as the application and effectiveness of preprocessing can greatly affect the results of the computational analysis.

Rather than a simple scaling operation, it ensures that all spectra within a dataset have the same vector length of 1. The vector of absorption intensities <em>x </em>can be converted to its corresponding unit vector&nbsp;by dividing each element, , by the vector length, <sup>86</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[1]</p><p><em>Baseline correction</em>: In transmission or transflection type IR spectroscopy, spectral baselines can be distorted as a result of scattering, absorption by the supporting substrate, changing conditions during data collection, or the variance due to instrumental factors. Such baseline distortions are critical when the absorbance values are systematically evaluated. Although baseline correction methods may rely on distinct principles and algorithms, they have the common objective of minimizing unwanted spectral offsets, broad baseline distortions, positive or negative slopes, and other baseline effects in vibrational spectra. Subtracting the estimation of a background from the un-processed spectrum leads to a more interpretable signal, allowing spectral parameters to be determined more accurately<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_85\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>85</sup></a>. A popular baseline technique available with Bruker Opus software is rubber-band baseline correction, which stretches the spectra down so that the minima in the spectral region of interest can be used to fit a convex polygonal line (i.e., the rubber band), which is then subtracted from the original spectrum.</p><p>Polynomial baseline correction is intended to be used when distortion of the spectra due to differentiation is not desired<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_86\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>86</sup></a>. The method is based on a least-squares polynomial curve-fitting function. The degree of the polynomial, <em>k</em>, is modulated in the user input. Equation 2 shows the generalized polynomial formula, where <em>M</em> is the number of terms associated with the polynomial at a particular degree. The measured spectrum&nbsp;with number of data points <em>n</em> becomes the fitted spectrum ; <em>a</em> represents the constant, and <em>x</em> represents the indeterminate of the polynomial. The residual sum-of-squares (RSS) between these two is given by Equation (3). These equations show a very standard polynomial least-squares fit. However, the implementation becomes a more useful baseline correction approach by iterating the smoothing 100 times (by default), and having a tolerance for change in <em>RSS</em> between iterations of 0.001 by default.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[3]</p><p>During this process, the small peak from 2,000 to 1,750 cm<sup>-1</sup> resulting from water vapor can be diminished manually. The peak can be leveled by connecting lines through the selected points and subtracting them from the trace. This method can remove the baseline slope and be offset by an iterative fitting process. The algorithm should be used before resolution enhancement techniques.</p><p><em>Analytical window selection</em>: Bands known to be in the 900\u20131200 region include the P\u2013O\u2013C and C\u2013O\u2013C stretches of mostly oligo- and polysaccharides<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>40</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_87\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>87</sup></a>.

There are several ways to evaluate the distance between or similarity of two spectra. The simplest way is to calculate the EUCLIDEAN distance between vectors. Other methods, such as CORRELATION and COSINE, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the angle between the vectors, respectively. For convenience, the results are also translated into a distance value.</p><p>For two spectra, <em>S</em> and <em>R,</em> in the data hypercube, this distance is defined as the correlation coefficient <em>C</em><sub><em>SR</em></sub> according to Equation 4.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[4]</p><p>Here, the spectra <em>S</em> and<em> R</em> are represented by one-dimensional vectors of M absorbance values, and&nbsp;and&nbsp;are the mean values for each vector. The resulting <em>C</em><sub><em>SR</em></sub> matrix contains <em>N</em><sup><em>2</em></sup> entries, where <em>N</em> is the total number of spectra within the data set. As the matrix is symmetric, only <em>N</em>(<em>N</em>\u20131)/2 spectral distance elements <em>C</em><sub><em>SR</em></sub> need to be computed.</p><p>Subsequently, the two most similar spectra in the hyper-cube are merged into a \u201ccluster\u201d, and a new distance matrix column is calculated for the new cluster and all existing spectra. The process of merging spectra or clusters into new clusters is repeated, and the <em>C</em><sub><em>SR</em></sub> is recalculated until all spectra have been combined into a few clusters. The mean spectra are extracted for all clusters and used for interpreting the chemical or biochemical differences between clusters. Reasonable noise in the spectral data does not affect the clustering process. In this respect, cluster analysis is much more stable than other methods of multivariate analysis in which an increasing amount of noise accumulates in the less relevant clusters</p><p><em>Hierarchical cluster analysis</em>: HCA and dendrograms are used to show analogies between bacterial spectra. Items closely related are clustered together on a branch with short twigs. The lines parallel to the item axis always connect two clusters (or single items) at a height that indicates at which distance the two clusters were merged into one. Therefore, in dendrograms, the left vertical axis describes the increasing variance or heterogeneity. The magnitude of this heterogeneity is based on the number of spectra in a cluster and the analogies between them.</p><p>When starting an agglomerative HCA, the&nbsp;distances calculated for all <em>N</em> items are sorted and the smallest distance between two single items leads to their merge into the first cluster. The second smallest distance is then processed. This is easy as long as only single items are involved. As far as the distance between a cluster and a single item, or the distance between two clusters, the two most useful linkage types are the AVERAGE linkage and WARD's algorithm, which are recommended for a first approach.</p><p>Though WARD often results in very nice and biologically meaningful clustering, one of its disadvantages is the distance scale, which varies with the number of items analyzed. In contrast, AVERAGE shows a scale that is independent of the number of items. This allows comparisons of completely different data sets and defining cut-off values for the distance to decide whether isolates are indistinguishable, closely related, or unrelated. Cluster analysis was performed by importing data hypercubes in the Bruker OPUS 3.0 format software package<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>105</sup></a>.</p><p>With regard to isolates and spectra, the most important goal for exploration of the presented data is to find a reasonable cut-off value for the distance to decide which isolates fall into the same cluster and are considered indistinguishable. There are at least two parameters to consider: the cut-off value should be as low as possible to achieve high discriminatory power and is only really discriminatory if spectra that belong together (e.g., the technical replica measurements) are not scattered over different clusters and are coherently together in one cluster. When looking at a data set that contains only isolates that were measured once (only technical replicates present), the correct cut-off value will likely be underestimated. Therefore, we advise the user add at least three independent measurements of some well-known and different isolates.</p><p><em>Principal components analysis</em>: PCA is one of the most common techniques for exploratory analysis. The original data are decomposed into a few principal components (PCs) responsible for most of the variance within the original dataset. The PCs are orthogonal to each other and are generated in a decreasing order of explained variance, so that the first PC represents most of the original data variance, followed by the second PC, and so forth<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>106</sup></a>.

The PCA loadings represent the variance in the variable (e.g., wavenumber) direction and are used to detect the variables with the highest importance for the pattern observed in the scores. The PCA scores represent the variance in the sample direction, and they are used to assess similarities/dissimilarities among the samples, detecting clustering patterns.</p><p><em>Feature extraction</em>: Feature extraction can be split into two distinct approaches: feature construction and feature selection<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_26\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>26</sup></a>. Briefly, feature construction can be defined as the creation of new features in a data set that can infer otherwise obscured information, such as the previously mentioned linear methods PCA and PLS. This can be especially important for diagnostics, biomarker extraction, and pattern recognition in otherwise homogeneous data sets, and it plays an important role in hyperspectral imaging, as individual pixels can be reduced to single values related to spectral intensity or variance<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>19</sup></a>.

By judging the similarity distance, bacteria can be identified at the genus, species, or subspecies level. The Pearson correlation coefficient and Euclidean distance are frequently used in distances measures, and Ward\u2019s link algorithm is most commonly employed in HCA to construct clusters<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_109\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>109</sup></a>.

The unknown bacteria can then be identified by recognizing the class assigned to it after a projection transformation using the former relationship with its feature data as the input. Compared to the supervised methods, the unsupervised methods have higher efficiency and lower expertise requirements, making them, particularly library-based methods, widely used in various fields for routine bacterial identification<a href=\"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/submission/fb6f0081-8661-407b-baac-2cd7d9305615/intro#_ENREF_110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup>110</sup></a>. The precise feature-extraction mentioned above is key for high-quality library construction and accurate identification, and the lower experimental standardization requirements (e.g., bacterial growth and culture media) of the features result in more stable and reliable identification.

Procedure\n3.1 Sample preparation \u25cfTIMING\n~1 h\n1| Bacterial growth\nPerform the steps in option A for bacterial cells cultured in solid medium or option B for bacterial cells in liquid medium.\n\u25cfTIMING 12\u201324 h\n(A)\u00a0\u00a0Bacterial cell culture on solid medium\n(i) For cell culture of bacteria, such as\nE. coli,\non TSA plates, incubate all bacteria for up to 16 h at an optimal temperature (35-37 \u00b0C).\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nIf concentrations of salts and nutrients in the agar differ, the growth and phenotype of the target organism will also be affected.\n! CAUTION\nDried out agar plates should not be used!\n(ii) A small amount of late exponential-phase cells (~10~60 \u00b5g dry wt) was carefully removed from confluent colonies on the agar surface using an incubating loop.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nIt is important that the bacteria used for comparative FT-IR spectrometric analysis have entered the same growth phase. Therefore, the user should compare FT-IR spectra of bacterial samples grown under similar conditions to ensure they are at the same growth phase.\n! CAUTION\nSamples that present various colony morphologies or colors on the culture plate were rejected to prevent incorporation of contaminated or mixed isolates.\n! CAUTION\nHandle all biological samples as a potential source of pathogens. Use appropriate protective attire (lab coats, safety glasses, latex gloves, and other conventional measures applied in the microbiology laboratory) and dispose of all biohazardous materials properly.\n! CAUTION\nChanging the agar with the sample will ultimately result in different results.\n! CAUTION\nDo not transfer any agar into the sample, which requires special care when harvesting. Loops should be closed and without sharp ends.\n(iii) It is recommended that the bacterial specimen be completely removed medium and suspended in 0.9% NaCl solution. Chemical extraction of bacteria is not required in this protocol.\n(optional)\nSubmerge the bacterial cells in the ethanol in the suspension vial, and then remove the bacterial cells from the plastic inoculation loop by flipping. Some bacteria will stay in the loop unsuspended, but this may be compensated for by the mass on and around the loop.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nIf the bacteria in the loop is too sticky and will not come off, try take a larger amount. If this does not work, cut off the loop with the adherent bacterial cells. A metal cylinder (Bruker Part No. 1851760) can be used to remove the biomass from the loop.\n(iv) After closing the suspension vial, vortex to form a homogeneous suspension. Do not leave the vial open during vortexing to avoid release of the solution.\n(B) Cell culture in liquid medium \u25cfTIMING 7 h\n(i) All strains are cultivated in LB broth at 37 \u00b0C for 24 hours with sustained shaking at 170 rpm.\n(ii) Harvest bacteria by centrifuging at 1500 g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.\n(iii) Gently resuspend the bacterial pellet in 0.9% NaCl solution by pipetting. Centrifuge again at 1500 g for 10 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Repeat once until the supernatant is clear.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nFor strain typing and differentiation, it makes no sense to measure the bacterial growth in different or mixed cultures.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL ST\nEP Variations in the incubation time (\u00b1 4 h) and growth in different non-selective culture media are not detrimental to reproducibility. However, it may change the typing or differentiation results. Minimize the variables and use fixed conditions: medium, temperature, incubation time, atmosphere, and humidity.\n! CAUTION\nIf concentrations of salts and nutrients in the agar differ, the growth and phenotype of the target organism will also be affected.\n! CAUTION\nPrior to use in bacterial culture, all of the experimental materials and regents should be autoclaved and handled under sterile conditions. Use sterile vessels or Petri dishes.\n2| Sample prepared for FT-IR spectroscopy\nTransfer the collected bacterial cells to appropriate FT-IR slides.\n(A) Transmission mode\n(i) The 50 \u03bcL of bacteria suspension was smeared on the surface of a CaF\n2\nslide.\n(ii) Sample drying. The bacteria suspension was dried at 40\u00b0C for 30 min. The spectra of the samples on these slides can be collected without interference from coating.\n! CAUTION\nControl the exposure temperature and exposure time. When the sample is exposed to a higher temperature or longer time, the bacterial film will swell, crack, and flake off.\n(B) \u00a0ATR mode\n(i) Drop the bacterial solution onto the cell and let it form a liquid droplet. At least three spots of the same sample are needed.\n! CAUTION\nBe careful to avoid introducing air bubbles.\n(C) Diffuse reflectance mode\n(i) Each isolate suspension is pipetted onto the silicon microtiter plate with 20 \u03bcL per spot.\n(ii) Sample drying: the bacterial suspension was dried at 40\u00b0C for 30 min.\n(iii) FT-IR analysis was initially performed using the plate without samples to provide a reference reading for each well.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nApply the sample as evenly as possible on the imprinted positions of the microtiter plate, i.e., the sample should cover each imprinted position completely and form a homogeneous layer.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nPipette technical replicates (at least quintuplicates) of each suspension on the target. The software is looking for reproducibility and the discriminatory power of the controls, and it cannot perform this with one spot of each.\n! CAUTION\nTo obtain optimal and reproducible results, the sample solution has to cover the imprinted position mark completely. Avoid partial coverage of the sample position.\n! CAUTION\nTo avoid scratches on the microtiter plate surface, always apply the sample solution using a pipette with a plastic tip.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n! CAUTION\nHandle all biological samples as a potential source of pathogens. Use appropriate protective attire (lab coats, safety glasses, latex gloves, and other conventional measures applied in the microbiology laboratory) and dispose of all biohazardous materials properly.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nFor good quality spectra, a single bacterial colony should be used. Particularly for the identification of bacterial subspecies, it is very important that the user only compares the spectra of bacterial samples grown under similar conditions.\n! CAUTION\nBe careful when handling the FT-IR slides. Hold the cell at its edges. Do not touch the cell surface, neither the front side nor the rear side. IR-spectroscopy is very sensitive to any contamination and will detect even fingerprints or dust.\n! CAUTION\nAvoid dropping or bending the plate, as it may break. A broken silicon plate has hard and sharp edges like glass. Handle with care!\n3| Equipment preparation \u25cfTIMING 2 h\n(10 bacterial samples)\nDifferent FT-IR instruments can be chosen. The options are transmission mode (option A), ATR mode (option B), or diffuse reflectance mode (option C).\n(A) Transmission FT-IR spectroscopy \u25cfTIMING 2 h\n(10 bacterial samples)\n(i) Turn on air-conditioning and a liquid desiccant system in the room in which you are doing the experiment. Control the temperature at 25\u00b0C.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nOnly operate the FT-IR machine in a well-enclosed room; air movement must be minimized. Maintaining a dry and steady test environment is very important.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n(ii) Turn on the drying equipment for the instrument.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nDry air or nitrogen should displace water vapor absolutely.\n(iii) Turn on the IR source.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n(iv) Turn on the FT-IR spectrometer.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nThe IR Biotyper should be permanently switched on.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nEach time after switching on the instrument, you must wait for ~1 h after power-up for the IR source to stabilize.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n(v) Turn on the computer and monitor, and then start the FT-IR collection program.\n(vi) Set the data path to store your data.\n(B) ATR FT-IR spectroscopy \u25cfTIMING 1 h\n(10 bacterial samples)\n(i) Open the instrument-operating software.\n(ii) Apply instrumental settings.\n(iii) Set the data path to store your data.\n(iv) Clean the ATR internal reflection element (diamond, zinc selenide, germanium, or silicon) with distilled water and dry it with tissue.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nMake sure that the crystal is thoroughly cleaned and dried before background acquisition.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nA prepared and dried sample plate can be stored for several days in a dry and dust-free place at room temperature without loss of sample quality.\n(v) Place the slide in contact with the ATR internal reflection element.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nEnsure that the ATR internal reflection element is completely covered by the sample and that the minimum sample thickness is 3~4 times the depth of penetration to ensure that there is no interference from the substrate.\n(C) Diffuse reflectance mode\n(i) To start the measurement, click Start Acquisition; the drawer will open and a dialog will request insertion of the microtiter plate.\n(ii) Insert the frame with the microtiter plate in the IR Biotyper instrument. After the drawer at the right side of the IR Biotyper instrument opens, put the frame with the inserted microtiter plate in the holding fixture. Make sure that the frame corner labeled A1 is placed in the marked corner of the X/Y-stage (recess with red point). Otherwise, when you evaluate the measurement results afterwards, the sample position and spectrum will not correspond with each other.\n(iii) Click Start\non the graphical user interface to close the drawer and start the measurement.\n! CAUTION\nDuring spectrum acquisition, the IR instruments can set a quality control to check the different spectral properties, e.g., absorbance intensity, SNR, and water vapor disturbance. The control sample can be the same standard samples that were inactivation bacteria. Spots with spectra pass this quality test. Failed spectra will not be taken into account for further calculations. (optional) Bruker Infrared Test Standards (Bruker Part No. 1851760) can be bought and used for quality control. two standard samples were usually used (IRTS1 and IRTS2).\n! CAUTION\nThe cell should be delivered in a clean, ready-to-use state and packed in a reclosable plastic bag. After use they can be cleaned. For the microtiter plate, if enough free spots are still available, it can be used for another measurement run. You can clean the microtiter plate by covering the surface with deionized water and carefully rubbing the plate with a sponge or cleaning tissue. To remove any fatty residues, repeat the cleaning with 60% (v/v) isopropanol. To dry the microtiter plate, use clean pressurized air (oil-free) or a clean and dust-free cleaning cloth.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n(iv) Turn on the drying equipment for the instrument.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nDry air or nitrogen should displace water vapor absolutely.\n(v) Turn on the IR source.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n(vi) Turn on the FT-IR spectrometer.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nThe IR Biotyper should be permanently switched on.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nEach time after switching on the instrument, you must wait for ~1 h after power-up for the IR source to stabilize.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n(vii) Turn on the computer and monitor, and then start the FT-IR collection program.\n(viii) Set the data path to store your data.\n! CAUTION\nThe cell should be delivered in a clean, ready-to-use state and packed in a reclosable plastic bag. After use they can be cleaned. For the microtiter plate, if enough free spots are still available, it can be used for another measurement run.

To remove any fatty residues, repeat the cleaning with 60% (v/v) isopropanol. To dry the microtiter plate, use clean pressurized air (oil-free) or a clean and dust-free cleaning cloth.\n4| Collecting FT-IR spectra \u25cfTIMING 1\u20133 h\nSet the spectrum collection parameters based on the chosen FT-IR instrument. The options are transmission mode (option A), ATR mode (option B), Biotyper (option C), or A/R (option D).\n(A) Transmission mode\nSpectrometer resolution: 4 cm\n-1\n; spectral range: 4,000 ~ 500 cm\n-1\n; scan number: 64.\n(B) ATR mode\nFT-IR-ATR spectra acquired from 4,000\u2013500 cm\n\u22121\nwith a resolution of 4 cm\n\u22121\nand 32 scans.\n(C) Diffuse reflectance\nmode\nSpectra collected over the wavelength range of 4000 to 600 cm\n-1\nat a rate of 20 scans per second with a resolution of 4 cm\n-1\n. To improve the SNR, 128 spectra were co-added and averaged.\n5| Collect a background spectrum without IR cell.\nThis spectrum is used to remove spectral signals that originate from air, moisture (water vapor), and coating materials on the reflecting mirrors along the IR radiation path from the spectra of the protein and buffer in order to subtract the background noise.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nIf the water vapor is not purged completely by dry air, there will be peaks in the regions of 1,500\u20131,200 cm\n-1\nand 4,000\u20133,500 cm\n-1\n. If these peaks appear, you should check the tubing and ensure no air leakage is occurring. You should also check the liquid desiccant system and drying equipment, and then purge for a longer period of time.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nAir bubbles and/or empty areas will result in poor absorption spectra caused by fringing from channel spectra, dispersion of the IR beam by bubbles, and/or incorrect absorbance from lack of sample.\n! CAUTION\nA background spectrum should be taken if atmospheric changes occur (e.g., if a door is suddenly opened).\n?TROUBLESHOOTING\n6| Collect a subtractive spectrum.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nIt is important to acquire the spectrum for the buffer before acquiring the spectrum for the sample.\n7| Collect a spectrum for one type of bacteria.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nThe sample cell must be handled with care. Make sure the bacterial film does not flake off.\n8| Save the raw data on the hard drive or other media.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nAlways save the data immediately to prevent loss if there is a power failure.\n9| Clean the cell when finished.\nWash the sample cell with ethyl alcohol (~5 mL volume), and then with an excess of water (~10 mL volume). Finally, gently wipe the windows with lens cleaning paper to keep them clean.\n! CAUTION\nThe overriding principle of experimental disposal is that all waste should be decontaminated, autoclaved, or incinerated within the laboratory to guarantee \"zero leaking\" of infectious biohazards.\n3.2 FT-IR spectrum pre-processing \u25cfTIMING 1~2h\n10| Calculate IR absorbance spectra.\nUpon completion of all measurements, use the function in the software to compute the absorbance spectra.\n?TROUBLESHOOTING\n11| Subtract reference spectra.\nSubtract the reference spectra from the bacterial spectra to remove the background signals (signals from water vapor, CO\n2\ngas, NaCl, etc.).\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nTo obtain high-quality bacterial IR spectra, the background spectra must be carefully and adequately subtracted from the obtained sample spectrum. Any uncompensated absorption bands in the original spectra will be enhanced by the derivative analysis due to degradation of the SNR.\n12| Perform baseline correction.\nThis is a pre-processing step to account and correct for noise and sloping baseline effects. Rubber band baseline correction is a convex polygonal line in which edges are \u2018\u2018troughs\u2019\u2019 within the spectrum. Manual point baseline correction picks the wavenumber locations of the polygonal line and can subtract the overlapped area from the absorption spectra.\n13| Savitsky-Golay differentiation\n(i) From the applications menu, select derivative function (first differentiation or second differentiation).\n(ii) Use a baseline-corrected seven-point Savitsky\u2013Golay derivative function.\n(iii) Save the second-derivative spectrum.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThe derivative spectra show the details much better, allowing the differences between different strains to be visualized. In particular, second-derivative spectra (for which ease of visual inspection is often inverted around the frequency axis) are well suited for identifying component bands in a complex spectral region.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThe sharp and narrow absorption peaks from residual water vapor would be greatly enhanced by the second-derivative analysis and distort the protein amide I bands. Discard points below a threshold, and then fit the remaining points with a straight line.\n14|\nSmoothing and data normalization.This step can be done using min-max normalization or vector normalization.\n(Optional) Scale the variables: this could be done by standardization (normalization of variables to zero mean and unit s.d.) or by normalization to a 0\u20131 range.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nPrior to conducting any kind of data analysis, it is important to assess the overall data quality and determine if there are any obvious outliers. Smooth and normalize the amide I band area. The application of smoothing is to remove the possible white noise, which results from using the second derivative function. As the spectra were collected on different instruments, even at the same protein concentration, the SNRs were quite different, especially at lower concentrations, and the application of smoothing and normalization were necessary.\n! CAUTION\nAs excessive smoothing can build up side lobes and periodic noise, which may be confused with true spectral features, the amount of smoothing should be kept to a minimum.\n15| After second-derivative calculation.\nTruncate the second-derivative spectrum to 900 and 1200 cm\n-1\nsections by selecting the Utilities function from the applications menu and then selecting the ZAP function.\n16| Baseline.\nA baseline can be easily obtained by connecting the two most positive points within the selected region.\n17|\nSave the final results.\nSave the results in a comma-separated value or CSV file (.csv) or a text file (.txt).\n?TROUBLESHOOTING\n3.3 Bacterial typing, classification, and identification \u25cfTIMING 2\u20135 h\n18| Create a new folder in your file system.\nThis will contain the preprocessed files.\n19| Assemble the data set.\n(1) Execute the following steps in Excel:\n(i) Open the text file created in the previous step. This will appear as a table in Excel. The last column of this table is filled with zeros, which means all spectra are initially assigned the same class.\n(ii) Next, enter the class labels in this column (take care not to miss any boxes). Use a different number for each class, starting from 0 or 1. Use numbers only.\n(iii) Save the spreadsheet as a \u2018Text (tab-delimited)\u2019 file. Choose a data analysis procedure appropriate to your analysis goal. Here, we cover clustering and identification. Options A and B (unsupervised classification) are suitable for bacterial typing at the strain and substrain level. Options C and D (supervised classification) are suitable for bacterial identification.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nEach list file was saved in a .csv or a text file (.txt) format containing several columns, with the first column corresponding to peak positions (cm\n-1\n) and the remaining columns corresponding to peak intensities. The first line of each peak list file is reserved for column labels. The replicates should share the same class label. At least five replicates are required in each class.\n! CAUTION\nThe data (except class labels) must not contain non-numeric values. Missing values or features should be given zeros.\n(2) (Optional) Software (IR-data-assemble) has been programmed by our lab and is provided freely.\nExecute IR-data-assemble:\n(i) Go to \u2018Macro\u2019 and select \u2018Run macro\u2019.\n(ii) Find the file \u2018IR-data-assemble\u2019 and then click \u2018Open\u2019.\n(iii) In the \u2018Path\u2019 field, enter the complete path for your raw files.\n(iv) In the \u2018Path destination\u2019 field, enter the complete path for the \u2018dat\u2019 folder created. Click \u2018OK\u2019. This will convert all raw files into preprocessed \u2018Pirouette .dat\u2019 files.\n(v) click \u2018Go!\u2019, then specify a location and file name to store your merged data set, and click \u2018Save\u2019.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nAt least five replicates are required for each group.\n20| Multivariate analysis\nAnalysis of the raw spectra produced by the procedure shown above can be performed with bioinformatics tools\n(Box 1)\n. We use hierarchical clustering as a simple and powerful tool\n(Box 1).\nWe describe two options for achieving this: using a home-made tool (A) or MetaboAnalyst (B).\n(A) Home-made tool: The \u2018\u2018home-made tool\u2019\u2019 is used to establish a library that can be used to identify individual sample bacteria at different levels. We provide this home-made tool as supporting information. First, several individual spectra are averaged to enerate the reference spectrum of the strain to establish the library. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used in the comparison of spectral profiles\n117\n, and the score derived from the distance is always used to indicate the similarity between the unknown and known bacteria. The matching scores of these spectra can be divided into ranges: highly probable species identification, probable species identification, reliable genus identification and unreliable identification according to the experimental results. Finally, a confusion matrix can be used to evaluate the typing performance of the library\n118\n.\n(B) MetaboAnalyst:\nMetaboAnalyst uses a step-wise data processing pipeline that guides users through all of the major data processing steps, beginning with data-type selection, formatting, \u201ccleansing,\u201d and normalization. It then guides users into using (or exploring) a number of data analysis options ranging from basic univariate (i.e.,\nt\ntests, analysis of variance [ANOVA]) and multivariate (i.e., PCA) methods for advanced machine learning approaches, such as random forest and support vector machine (SVM) classification.\n(i) You can enter\nhttps://www.metaboanalyst.ca/\nin the address bar and the browser navigates to a corresponding page. Click on the Statistical Analysis button.\n(ii) Upload the files, choose Data Type: spectral bins; Format: samples in columns (unpaired); Data file: .csv.\n(iii) Data integrity checking is done to ensure that the data meets the basic requirements for meaningful downstream analysis.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nMetaboAnalyst (\nhttp://www.metaboanalyst.ca\n) is a comprehensive Web application for metabolomic data analysis and interpretation. It provides a variety of data processing and normalization procedures and supports a number of data analysis and data visualization tasks using a range of univariate and multivariate methods, such as PCA, heatmap clustering, and machine learning methods. The software was carefully designed to enable researchers with little statistical or computational background to perform complex data analysis procedures commonly used in metabolomic studies.\n(iv) Low-quality data filtering.\nSelect the default \u201cInterquantile range (IQR)\u201d and click the Process button.\n(v) Select \u201cNormalization by sum\u201d for sample normalization. After normalization, click the Proceed button.\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP\nDifferences in thickness or concentration can sometimes be the most prominent source of spectral variation between samples, often masking the biochemical differences. To minimize these effects, the spectra in the dataset are scaled to match a specific criterion. Normalization to a particular peak can be applied when such a peak is consistently present in all spectra in the dataset.\n(vi) Click the Submit button to proceed to the Data Analysis Exploration page. Five major analysis categories are presented: univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, significant feature identification, cluster analysis, and classification & feature selection. Listed under each of these five categories are many other subcategories containing individual methods. The most particular approaches are useful for clustering, such as PCA and dendrogram, which are listed under the Multivariate Analysis category, and heatmaps, which is listed under the Cluster Analysis category. The user can choose the preferred mathematical method.\n(vii) Click Download to generate a .pdf report (Analysis_Report.pdf).\nYou have the choice between two views: distance matrix and dendrogram. The distance matrix shows all distances of the spectra to each other sorted according to the chosen HCA, whereas the dendrogram gives a more condensed, tree-like overview of the spectral relations. In general, we recommend using the dendrogram view first.\nBox 1 COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR BACTERIAL FT-IR PATTERN ANALYSIS\nFor bacterial data analysis, we use the IR software (ABB). Using this software, we pre-process spectra by applying default parameters, whereby we apply FT-IR spectra compressing, the Savitsky\u2013Golay smoothing and second-derivative method, and rubber band baseline correction method. For data normalization, we use \u2018maximum norm\u2019.\nFor species and subspecies typing, we hierarchically cluster the FT-IR spectra of bacterial species and subspecies. Each FT-IR spectrum in a dataset is compared to the other spectra. On the basis of the distance values, we produce a dendrogram using the appropriate function of the statistical toolbox of Biotyper. Taking a list of FT-IR signals and their intensities into consideration, dendrograms are produced by similar scoring of a set of FT-IR spectra. A correlation function is applied to calculate distance values. In general, species with distance levels <0.15 are reliably classified. However, this value can be changed by the user.\nClearly, the FT-IR spectra analysis for bacterial samples is not restricted to the described software package that is applied in our laboratory. Instead of hierarchical clustering, model construction can also be applied. The user may also test alternative classification procedures and software from other companies. Statistical tools, such as Matlab, are described by Al-Holy et al.\n98\n. Moreover, specific software for bacterial identification and analysis has been developed by a number of academic research groups.\nBox 2 COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR BACTERIAL IDENTIFICATION\nComputational tools for bacterial identification include five main steps: spectral preprocessing, feature-extraction, library construction, distance measuring, and score and prediction.\nSpectral preprocessing\n: The raw spectral profile data always present complex features. In addition to the true signal, two main disturbances can be revealed in the spectra: baseline drift, and noise that comes from electric and/or chemical interference. Spectra obtained from different conditions, such as different instrument parameters or different amounts of sample, can have different spectral intensities, which should be deleted for an equal weighted analysis. The valuable feature is usually expressed as a peak value or derivative data regarding the raw data. Consequently, the raw profile data need to be preprocessed to reduce redundant and noise information and obtain valuable signals. Baseline correction, smoothing, normalization, first or second derivative, and peak picking are commonly used in this step before mathematization\n109\n.\nFeature-extraction\n: As mentioned above, feature construction methods, such as PCA and PLS, or feature selection methods, such as genetic algorithm, multivariate curve resolution, and successive projection algorithm, can be employed in this step to extract the most informative variables that will be used later in the resultant model. In this case, the amount of data is greatly reduced and the model execution more efficient.\nLibrary construction\n: Library construction can also be described as the creation of reference spectra for known bacteria of interest. In general, a number of spectra data are collected, with the aim of accurately describing the known bacteria, and the reference spectrum is created using the features extracted from this spectra by an average or other linear combination algorithm\n119\n. The precise feature-extraction, meaning qualifies features and just the right amount of features selected in this step, plays an important role in increasing the discriminatory power of library-based approaches, and the lower experimental standardization requirements (e.g., bacterial growth and culture media) of the features allow more stable and reliable identification\n10\n. According to the importance of these features in distinguishing one strain from another or to categorize one strain within a group, different weights of these features can be assigned and recorded in the database to achieve more accurate identification.\nDistance measure\n: The similarity between the unknown and known bacteria can be calculated through a distance measure algorithm, most commonly the Pearson correlation coefficient\n17\n,\n109\n,\n110\n. In this algorithm, values with the same feature make a pair, and all values presenting different features of the unknown and reference spectra are compared in these pairs. A higher score means a shorter distance and will be obtained when the values in each pair are closer. Bacterial identification often requires analysis of the entire spectrum rather than one or a few biomarker features, and the different weights assigned to the spectrum features allows a more accurate comparison. In addition, strain identification is often facilitated with software employing advanced statistical analyses\n110\n.\nScore and prediction\n: A score derived from the distance is always used to indicate the similarity between the unknown and known bacteria. In general, a higher score indicates greater similarity, and the highest matching scores and related spectra in the library will be selected as the final results among all of the comparisons between the unknown spectrum and the spectra in the library. Next, a prediction is made according to the score, with a higher score resulting in a more precise result. The highest matching scores of these comparisons with the Biotyper\nTM\ndatabase were divided into ranges: highly probable species identification (>2.3), probable species identification (2.0\u20132.3), reliable genus identification (1.7\u20132.0), and unreliable identification (<1.7)\n120\n."

A clear discrimination of different species could be observed in <strong>Fig. 6</strong>, and 12 distinct clusters were produced in <strong>Fig. 7 </strong>for the discrimination of 12 strains of <em>E. coli</em>.</p><p><strong>6.2 Identification of <em>E. coli</em>. and <em>Shigella</em></strong></p><p>A FT-IR spectra library can be employed to identify individual bacteria at different levels. Usually, several individual bacterial spectra are averaged to enerate the reference spectrum of the strain to establish the library, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used in spectral comparison. The score derived from the bacteria spectral distance is always used to indicate the similarity between the unknown and known bacteria. After comparison, the reference strain with the highest correlation score for the comparison was regarded to be the result of the identification. The library-based identification of 207 FT-IR spectra of <em>E. coli</em>. and <em>Shigella</em> strains was shown in <strong>Fig. 8.</strong> The identification accuracy was 95.2% for distinguishing between <em>E. coli</em> and <em>Shigella</em> at the genus level. For species and strain level, the identification accuracy are 91.8% and 81.2% for all selected strains, respectively.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is a label-free and highly sensitive technique that provides complete information on the chemical composition of biological samples. The bacterial FT-IR signals are extremely specific and highly reproducible fingerprint-like patterns, making FT-IR an efficient tool for bacterial typing and identification. Due to the low cost and high flux, FT-IR has been widely used in hospital hygiene management for infection control, epidemiological studies, and routine bacterial determination of clinical laboratory values. However, the typing and identification accuracy could be affected by many factors, and the bacterial FT-IR data from different laboratories are usually not comparable. A standard protocol is required to improve the accuracy of FT-IR-based typing and identification. Here, we detail the principles and procedures of bacterial typing and identification based on FT-IR spectroscopy, including bacterial culture, sample preparation, instrument operation, spectra collection, spectra preprocessing, and mathematical data analysis. Without bacterial culture, a typical experiment generally takes &lt;2 h.</p>",
