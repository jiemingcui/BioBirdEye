            "content": "Organoids are structures comprised of multiple cell types that are spatially organized similarly to an organ and recapitulate at least some specific organ functions<sup>4</sup>. Several types of organoids have been described, derived both from adult tissue and from pluripotent stem cells. This technology will likely have a major impact on the study of developmental biology, organ physiology and function, and disease modeling<sup>5,6</sup>. However, a true human lung organoid model has not yet been realized. The respiratory system consists of a complex branched system of progressively smaller airways that terminate in alveoli where gas exchange takes place<sup>7,8</sup>. Generation of human lung organoids has previously been reported<sup>9,10</sup>. However, the organoids described did not show branching morphogenesis or proximodistal specification, while function was not documented. The lung bud organoid \\(LBO) model described in the current protocol displays branching morphogenesis, proximodistal specification and evidence of early alveologenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Their development reaches a stage equivalent to the second trimester of human development.  LBO-derived branching structures in Matrigel contain type 2 alveolar epithelial cells \\(AT2) with abundant lamellar bodies and are capable of uptake and release of surfactant protein in vitro. Furthermore, secretion of mucins and surfactant proteins, as well as ciliary movement, were demonstrated after xenografting. The LBOs generated by this protocol therefore fulfill the definition of true organoids, and will be useful for studying human lung development and potentially for modeling human lung disease."

Add 6 ml of diluted Matrigel solution to each 10 cm\n2\ntissue culture-treated dishes and let them sit for at least 3 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4\no\nC.\r\n  4. To make one 6-well plate embryoid bodies \\(EBs), dissociate two confluent wells \\(from a 6-well plate) of human pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs) using 1ml/well Accutase and incubate in a normoxic incubator for 2-3 minutes.\r\n  5. Aspirate the Accutase.\r\n  6. Neutralize the enzyme by stop media. \r\n  7. Pellet the dissociated cells by centrifugation at 1,400 r.p.m. for 4 minutes.\r\n  8. Aspirate enzyme and stop media as much as possible.\r\n  9. Re-suspend the cells with 10-12 ml hPSC maintenance media.\r\n  10.

Incubate the cells in a normoxic incubator overnight.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Endoderm induction \\(d0-d4)**\r\n\n\n1. On d0, remove the hPSC maintenance media from the Matrigel-coated dish and add 3 ml trypsin. Incubate the dish for 1-1.5 minutes in a normoxic incubator.\r\n  2. Aspirate trypsin solution and stop the remaining enzyme by adding 10 ml stop media.\r\n  3. Collect the detached cells and pellet by centrifugation at 1,400 r.p.m. for 4 minutes.\r\n  4. Aspirate the enzyme and stop media.\r\n  5. Re-suspend the cells with 12 ml Embryoid bodies/primitive streak formation media and distribute to a 6-well low-attachment plate \\(2 ml/well).\r\n  6. Place the low-attachment plate in a low oxygen incubator to allow embryoid body \\(EB) formation.\r\n  7. After 12-16 hours , collect all EBs in a 15-ml tube and centrifuge at 800 r.p.m. for 1 minute.\r\n  8. Aspirate the Embryoid bodies/primitive streak formation media.\r\n  9. Gently re-suspend the EBs with 12 ml Endoderm induction media and distribute them equally back to the low-attachment plate \\(2 ml/well). \r\n  10. Return the plate back to a low oxygen incubator.\r\n  11. On d2, add 1 ml fresh Endoderm induction media to each well.\r\n  12. On d3, add 2 ml fresh Endoderm induction media to each well. \r\n  13. On d4.1-d4.3, check endoderm yield by flow cytometric analysis of CXCR4 and c-kit expression. If the endoderm yield is >90%, continue the differentiation **\\(Fig. 1) \\(Please see trouble shooting point 1)**.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Anteriorization \\(d5-d6)**\r\n\n\n1. Prepare fibronectin-coated 6-well plates by diluting fibronectin to 0.2% \\(vol/vol, 1:500, 4 \u03bcg/ml) in DPBS. Add 2ml fibronectin/DPBS solution to each well and incubate the plates in a normoxic incubator for at least 30 minutes or 4\no\nC overnight.\r\n  2. Dissociate the EBs into single cells with trypsin \\(3ml of trypsin per 6-well plate of EBs for a maximum 4-minute digestion) **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 2)**.\r\n  3. Neutralize the enzyme by stop media. \r\n  4. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.\r\n  5. Pellet the dissociated cells by centrifugation at 1,400 r.p.m. for 4 minutes.\r\n  6.

Add 2 ml of cell mixture to each well \\(6-well plate, fibronectin-coated, see step 1). \r\n  9. Incubate the plates in a normoxic incubator.\r\n  10. After 24 hours \\(\u00b1 1 hour), replace the Anteriorization media-1 with Anteriorization media-2 \\(2ml/well).\r\n  11. Return the plates back to a normoxic incubator.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Ventralization and Lung Bud Organoid \\(LBO) formation \\(d6-d25)**\r\n\n\n1. After 24 hours \\(\u00b1 1 hour), replace the Anteriorization media-2 with Ventralization media/Branching media \\(2ml/well). \r\n  2. Return the plates back to a normoxic incubator.\r\n  3. Forty-eight hours later, aspirate all the Ventralization media/Branching media and add 2 ml fresh Ventralization media/Branching media to each well. \r\n  4. Suspend the organoids by gently pipetting up and down throughout the well with P1000 tips. \r\n  5. Transfer the suspended organoids to non-tissue culture-treated plates **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 4)**.\r\n  6. Return the plates back to a normoxic incubator.\r\n  7. Feed the organoids every other day by tilting the plate and allowing the organoids to sink to the bottom edge. Remove the old media while avoiding touching the organoids. Add 2 ml fresh Ventralization media/Branching media to each well **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 5)**.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Branching organoid \\(d20-end of experiment)**\r\n\n\n1.

Put the desired number of organoids per insert into each well \\(96-well U-bottom plate containing 100 \u03bcl of fresh Ventralization media/Branching media per well). Typically, one to four organoids are plated per insert \\(24-well insert).\r\n  3. Place 24-well inserts into non-tissue culture treated plates. \r\n  4. Lay 50 \u03bcl of 100% cold Matrigel into the bottom of each insert. \r\n  5. Wait 5 minutes or until the Matrigel has solidified.\r\n  6. Remove the Ventralization media/Branching media one well at a time **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 6)**.\r\n  7. Mix the organoids with 30 \u03bcl of 100% cold Matrigel gently to avoid creating bubbles. \r\n  8. Immediately put the organoid-Matrigel mixture in the center of an insert. \r\n  9. Wait for 5 minutes for the Matrigel to solidify to secure the organoids in the center of the insert.\r\n  10. Add another 50 \u03bcl of 100% cold Matrigel to the insert to create a Matrigel sandwich. \r\n  11. Put the plates in a normoxic incubator for 10 minutes to make sure all Matrigel has solidified. \r\n  12. Add 500 \u03bcl of Ventralization media/Branching media to the insert and another 500 \u03bcl of Ventralization media/Branching media into the wells.\r\n  13. Incubate the cultures in a normoxic incubator and replace the media every 2-3 days **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 7)**."

Over-trypsinization of EBs will lead to extensive cell death on d5.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. If, in the step 7 in Anteriorization section, the initial cell density is significantly lower than 7.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well, smaller organoids will be observed on d8. These organoids tend to become hollow spheres later in culture **\\(Fig. 2, right panel, arrows)**. \r\n  If the culture is initiated with significantly more than 7.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well, adherent organoid formation might be less obvious on d8 **\\(Fig. 3, right panel)**. In this case, the experiment can still proceed to Ventralization and Lung Bud Organoid \\(LBO) formation however \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. The organoids do not attach to the bottom of non-tissue culture-treated plates. However, when the endoderm yield is suboptimal, mesenchymal cells might dissociate from the organoids, attach to the plate and deposit extracellular matrix resulting in organoid attachment.  If the organoids attach to the bottom of non-tissue treated plates, perform gentle pipetting to lift them up from the plates. Alternatively, low-attachment plates can be used. These are much more expensive however.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. During d15-d20, organoids are highly proliferative. Three milliliters of fresh Ventralization media/Branching media can be fed to each well instead of 2 ml.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. To avoid Matrigel solidification in U-bottom 96-well plate before transferring to 24-well inserts, we suggest embedding organoids one insert at a time \\(step 6-8).\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. In later-stage organoid cultures, especially with multiple organoids in each insert, more than 500 \u03bcl Ventralization media/Branching media can be fed to each insert if the media turns yellow quickly."

Folding structures within suspended organoids arise as early as d10-d12. Generation of branching buds from organoids occurs one week after embedding into Matrigel. Extensive branching organoids is observed 2-3 weeks post embedding. Different cell lines behave differently during early organoid formation. Several iPS lines tended not to have obvious adherent clumps on d8, prior to organoid suspension. However, they formed organoids after suspension and they did branch in Matrigel **\\(Please see Supplementary Fig. 3a of the Associated Publication.)**."

Based on the 2D protocol previously published by our group<sup>1-3</sup>, we have designed a 3D system, in which hPSCs are sequentially differentiated into definitive endoderm \\(DE), to anterior foregut endoderm \\(AFE) and, ventral AFE in adherent 2D culture, followed by suspension culture to allow for LBO formation. When plated in Matrigel at d25, the LBOs underwent extensive outward branching and eventually formed dilated tips, reminiscent of saccules formed during the saccular stage of lung development. These cultures can be used to study human lung development and branching morphogenesis.",
