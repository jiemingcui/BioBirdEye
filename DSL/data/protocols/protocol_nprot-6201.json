            "content": "Pluripotent stem cells \\(PSCs) including embryonic stem cells \\(ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells \\(iPSCs) can be maintained _in vitro_ under chemically defined conditions and are capable of generating any cell type of the three germ layers, making them an invaluable resource to obtain patient specific cells for disease modelling, drug screening and cell replacement therapies<sup>1-3</sup>. Based on studies of mouse ESCs, two distinct states of pluripotency have been defined, and they differ markedly from each other. Naive mouse ESCs are being isolated from the pre-implantation inner cell mass \\(ICM) of blastocysts are germline competent and they are molecularly and functionally similar to ICM<sup>1,2</sup>. In contrast, primed mouse ESCs exhibit characteristics of the post-implantation epiblast state and lack germline competency<sup>4</sup>. Unlike mouse PSCs, human PSCs are traditionally maintained in growth conditions that capture the primed pluripotent state<sup>5,6</sup>, which has led to intensive research to develop growth conditions that support the derivation and maintenance of human naive PSCs. Hence, diverse medium composition have been developed and various approaches have been employed to isolate or generate human ESCs or iPSCs under naive culture conditions<sup>7-12</sup>. We took advantage of iPSC technology to derive and characterise different types of human naive PSCs generated from fibroblasts of genetically matched donors using integration-free reprogramming approaches to unveil the differences between various human naive cell culture conditions."

Primary human adult dermal fibroblasts \\(HDFa) from different donors \\(note: chose female donors if the aim is to study X-chromosome reactivation) can be obtained from Gibco \\(Catalogue number, C-013-5C). \r\n  2. For recovery of the commercially purchased cryopreserved stock vials, cells are to be thawed quickly at 37\u00baC and then pelleted at 200xg for 5 minutes.\r\n  3. Resuspend the cell pellet in 10ml 106 medium \\(Gibco) supplemented with LSGS \\(Gibco) and plated into a T75 flask \\(one cryovial to one T75). \r\n  4. Culture the cells in a 37\u00baC, 5% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\nincubator for expansion. Media are changed every other day and cultures split at a 1:3-1:5 ratio when they reach confluence.\r\n  5. For cryo-preservation, freeze cells in 90% FBS \\(Gibco) with 10% DMSO \\(Santa cruz); we suggest to generate a large number of early passage stock for future experiments.\r\n  \r\n\n\n_Culturing human pluripotent stem cells in conventional primed condition_\r\n\n\n1. Conventional primed human iPSCs and H9 ESCs \\(WA09, WiCell Research Institute, Madison, WI, http://www.wicell.org) are maintained in a feeder-free E8 media system and passaged every 4-5 days. \r\n  2. Before passaging, coat culture vessels with vitronectin \\(VTN-N, Gibco, 1:100 dilution in PBS) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions for 1 hour at room temperature. \r\n  3. For passaging, wash cells twice with PBS \\(Gibco) to remove traces of calcium and magnesium and then overlay cultures with a 0.5mM EDTA/PBS solution \\(Invitrogen) for ~5 minutes. The EDTA solution can be aspirated out of the culture flask at this time \\(as cells have not dislodged yet) and fresh E8 medium \\(Gibco) can be used to break the colonies into small clumps by gently pipetting. We normally transfer 1/10th of the solution \\(1:10 split) into a fresh culture vessel and add sufficient E8 medium required for the particular culture vessel format \\(e.g. fill up to 10ml for a T75 flask). 10\u03bcM Y-27632 \\(abcam) can be added to the E8 media to boost viability. \r\n  4. Culture the cells  in a 37\u00baC, 5% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\nincubator and media are changed on a daily basis.\r\n  NOTE: All human pluripotent stem cells used are frozen and thawed using the PSC cryopreservation kit \\(Gibco) according to instructions unless stated otherwise.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Conversion of primed hPSCs to a naive state by use of specific media_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_NHSM culture condition_:\r\n\n\n1. For conversion of established human primed ESCs or iPSCs to the naive NHSM state\n7\n, irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts \\(iMEFs, always 2x10\n4\ncells/cm\n2\n) are seeded into 6-well plates one day before the experiment in MEF media. NOTE: iMEFs are always seeded a day before replating human cultures to allow their proper attachment. \r\n  2. ~0.5x10\n5\n-1x10\n5\nhuman primed ESCs or iPSCs are seeded per well of a 6-well plate onto the layer of iMEFs in E8 medium \\(Gibco) in the presence of 10\u03bcM Y-27632 \\(abcam). After 24 or 48 hours, the medium can be switched to human naive NHSM medium. \r\n  3. When the cultures become confluent, cells are passaged onto a fresh iMEF layer using Accutase \\(Stem cell technologies). For this, wash the cells with PBS and incubate with Accutase \\(Stem cell technologies) for ~3-5 minutes, then gently  dissociate the cells with DMEM/F-12 media \\(Gibco). \r\n  4. Spin down at 200xg for 5 minutes and then resuspend in naive NHSM medium and seed onto a fresh layer of iMEFs at 1:5-1:20 split ratio. NOTE: we recommend to try a range of split ratios for all different human naive cell lines to determine the optimal density.\r\n  5. Cells are cultured in a 37\u00baC, 5% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\nincubator and media is to be changed on a daily basis. Cells are usually passaged every 4-5 days.\r\n  \r\n\n\n_RSeT culture condition_:\r\n\n\n1. To convert established human primed iPSCs to naive RSeT cells, 6-well plates with iMEFs are prepared one day in advance.\r\n  2. Primed cells are dissociated into small clumps using 0.5mM EDTA/PBS solution \\(Invitrogen) and then 0.5x10\n5\n~1x10\n5\nprimed cells seeded per 6-well onto the prepared iMEF feeder layer in E8 medium \\(Gibco) with 10\u03bcM Y-27632 \\(abcam). \r\n  3. Switch to naive RSeT medium after 24 hours and change media every day thereafter.\r\n  4. When the culture is confluent, cells are passaged using TrypLE express \\(Gibco), incubate for ~3-5 minutes and this is followed by dilution and dissociation \\(repeated gentle pipetting) of cells with DMEM/F-12 media \\(Gibco). \r\n  5. Pellet cells at 300xg for 5 minutes and then resuspend in naive RSeT medium and seed onto a fresh layer of iMEFs at a 1:4-1:10 split ratio.\r\n  6. Cells are cultured and maintained in a 37\u00baC, 5% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\nincubator and daily media change is required for this cell line. Cells are usually passaged every 4-5 days.\r\n  NOTE: please refer to the manufacturers\u2019 manual for detailed protocol.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_5iLAF culture condition_:\r\n\n\n1. The conversion of established primed iPSCs to human naive 5iLAF was performed as previously described\n10,13\n. 6-well plates with iMEFs are prepared one day in advance. \r\n  2. 0.5~1x10\n5\nprimed cells are seeded per well onto the feeder layer of iMEFs in E8 medium \\(Gibco) with 10\u03bcM Y-27632 \\(abcam). 48 hours later, the medium is to be switched to human naive 5iLAF medium. \r\n  3. Cells were passaged onto a fresh layer of iMEFs using Accutase \\(Stem Cell Technologies) whe cultures are confluent at a 1:10-1:20 ratio every 6-7 days. Dome-shaped colonies usually arise after 2-3 passages.\r\n  \r\n\n\n_Conversion of primed hPSCs into the naive t2iLG\u00f6Y state with reprogramming factors \\(Sendai viral approach)_\r\n\n\n1. For the conversion of established primed hESCs/hiPSCs into naive t2iLG\u00f6Y hPSCs via the Sendai viral approach, 6-well plates are coated with vitronectin \\(VTN-N, Gibco, as per manufactures instructions) for 1 hour at room temperature.\r\n  2. Primed cells are gently dissociated and seeded onto VTN-N \\(Gibco) coated 6-well plates in E8 medium \\(Gibco) at ~0.5-1x10\n5\ncells per well with 10\u03bcM Y-27632 \\(abcam). \r\n  3. After 24-48 hours, Sendai viral transduction can be performed in E8 medium \\(Gibco) with multiplicity of infection \\(MOI) of 5, 5, and 6 \\(_KOS_ MOI=5, _c-MYC_ MOI=5, _KLF4_ MOI=6) for _OSKM_ mediated conversion or _KLF4_ at a MOI=6 for _KLF4_ only conversion. \r\n  4. 24 hours later, replace with fresh E8 medium \\(Gibco) and iMEF feeders \\(at 2x10\n4\ncells/cm\n2\n) are seeded on top of the converting primed cells at the same time. The medium is then switched to naive t2iLG\u00f6Y medium after 24 hours. Cells are passaged using Accutase \\(Stem cell technologies) onto a feeder layer of iMEFs when cultures are confluent at a split ratio of 1:10-1:20. Naive dome-shaped colonies should appear after 2-4 passages \\(passaging should be performed every 6-7 days). \r\n  \r\n\n\n_Conversion of primed hPSCs into the naive t2iLG\u00f6Y state with reprogramming factors \\(mRNA approach)_\r\n\n\n1. For conversion of established primed hESCs/hiPSCs to naive t2iLG\u00f6Y cells with _KLF4_ only via the mRNA approach, ~2-4x10\n4\ncells per well are seeded on VTN-N \\(Gibco) coated 12-well plates in E8 medium \\(Gibco) with 10\u03bcM Y-27632 \\(abcam).\r\n  2. After 1-2 days, transfect cells with NM-RNA reprogramming transfection complex containing Opti-MEM \\(Gibco), RNAiMAX \\(Invitrogen), EKB mRNA \\(Stemgent) and human _KLF4_ mRNA \\(Stemgent) prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions\n14\n. \r\n  3. 15 hours later, replace the medium with fresh E8 medium \\(Gibco). This transfection process has to be repeated daily for another 8 days in E8 medium \\(Gibco). \r\n  4. Then passage the cells  onto a feeder layer of iMEFs in E8 medium \\(Gibco) on day 10, followed on the same day by another round of transfection.\r\n  5. The medium can then be switched to naive t2iLG\u00f6Y medium the next day and the transfection process is repeated for another 5 days in naive t2iLG\u00f6Y medium. \r\n  6. Cells are then passaged using Accutase \\(Stem cell technologies) onto a fresh layer of irradiated MEFs. Naive dome-shaped colonies should appear after ~3-5 passages. \r\n  \r\n\n\n_Generation of primed and naive hiPSCs from human fibroblasts \\(Sendai viral approach)_\r\n\n\n1. For somatic cell reprogramming with the Cytotune 2.0 kit, experiments were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions \\(Invitrogen). \r\n  2. HDFa are seeded at ~5x10\n4\ncells per well of a 6-well plate in MEF medium. \r\n  3. After 2 days, cells are transduced with Sendai viruses in MEF medium at MOI as follows, _KOS_ MOI=5, _c-MYC_ MOI=5, _KLF4_ MOI=6. \r\n  4. After 24 hours, the medium is replaced with fresh MEF medium and media are changed every other day thereafter. \r\n  5. On day 7, cells are trypsinized, counted and seeded onto a layer of iMEF feeders or alternatively \\(for derivation of primed cells) onto VTN-N \\(Gibco) coated T25 flasks at ~1-2x10\n5\ncells per flask in MEF medium. NOTE: we recommend to try a range of seeding density to generate different human naive cells directly via reprogramming.\r\n  6. The next day, the cells are transitioned to different culture media including primed and the other different types of naive culture conditions \\(NHMS, RSeT, 5iLAF, t2iLG\u00f6Y). Daily media change is required for all conditions thereafter.\r\n  7. 21 days after transduction, cells can be passaged and expanded using methods and media as described above or subcloned by picking colonies using a dissection microscope. \r\n  \r\n\n\n_Generation of primed and naive t2iLG\u00f6Y hiPSCs from human fibroblasts \\(mRNA approach)_\r\n\n\n1. For somatic cell reprogramming via the mRNA approach, the experiments are performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions of the StemRNA NM reprogramming kit \\(Stemgent)\n14\n. \r\n  2. 2x10\n4\nprimary HDFa per well of a 12-well plate are seeded in MEF medium.\r\n  3. After 24 hours, cells are transfected with NM-RNA reprogramming transfection complex containing _OSKMNL_ NM-RNA, EKB NM-RNA and NM-microRNAs generated with Opti-MEM \\(Gibco) and RNAiMAX \\(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \r\n  4. 15 hours later media are renewed with fresh MEF medium. \r\n  5. The transfection process is repeated for another 3 days. \r\n  6. On day 5, cells are trypsinized and ~1-2x10\n5\ncells per T25 flask are seeded either onto VTN-N \\(Gibco) coated T25 flasks or onto iMEF feeders in MEF medium. NOTE: we recommend to try a range of seeding density to obtain optimal outcomes for each condition.\r\n  7. The next day cells are transitioned to E8 medium \\(Gibco) or naive t2iLG\u00f6Y medium respectively. \r\n  8. Subsequently, E8 primed iPSCs are passaged with 0.5mM EDTA/PBS \\(Invitrogen) onto VTN-N \\(Gibco) coated T25 flasks every 4-5 days and naive t2iLG\u00f6Y iPSCs are passaged with Accutase \\(Stem cell technologies) onto fresh iMEF feeders every 6-7 days as described above. \r\n  \r\n\n\n_Conversion of naive t2iLG\u00f6Y hiPSCs to primed hiPSCs_\r\n\n\n1. For conversion of established naive t2iLG\u00f6Y cells to the primed state, naive ells are trypsinized, counted and seeded onto VTN-N \\(Gibco) coated 6-well plates \\(in a range of density) in t2iLG\u00f6Y media for 24 hours.\r\n  2. The next day cells are transitioned to E8 medium \\(Gibco). Cells are then cultured and passaged as described above for E8 primed cells."

Depending on the culture conditions, it is recommended to try a range of seeding density to identify the ideal density for each particular cell line."
