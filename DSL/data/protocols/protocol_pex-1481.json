            "content": "<p>The generation and analysis of bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice is a common technique in the fields of immunology, hematology, and stem cell biology. Current applications include assaying the functional potential of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and evaluating how genetic alterations influence hematopoietic and immune cell functions (1,2). Although a well-established technique, BM chimera assays currently have several limitations. These include the need to pre-condition recipient mice with irradiation or chemotherapy to achieve donor cell engraftment and the common use of multicolor fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify donor HSPCs, which requires expensive and complex equipment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently developed a novel poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) based cell culture media that could support the long-term expansion of functional hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (3,4). PVA is a chemically synthesized polymer that stabilized cytokines in vitro (5) and can replace the use of serum albumin supplements (e.g., fetal bovine serum or bovine serum albumin), which contains numerous biologically active contaminants that can induce loss of HSC function ex vivo (6). This HSC expansion method was initially validated using FACS purified HSCs (3). However, we have since discovered that this PVA-based media, containing only two cytokines (stem cell factor or SCF, and thrombopoietin or TPO), selectively supports the growth of HSPCs and can therefore be used to expand HSPCs from mouse bone marrow without the need for FACS purification (see Associated Publication). This new FACS-free protocol is described here. Potential applications of this protocol include ex vivo genetic manipulation of HSPCs and the generation of conditioning-free BM chimeric mice, which are described in our Associated Publication.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice are a valuable tool in the field of immunology and hematology, and genetic manipulation of donor cells is widely used to study gene function under physiological and pathological settings. Current BM chimera protocols generally require use of multicolor fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for donor hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) purification. Here, we describe a cell culture technique for the enrichment of functional HSPCs from mouse BM without the use of FACS purification. This technique is therefore expected to overcome current limitations in mouse BM chimera models.</p>",
