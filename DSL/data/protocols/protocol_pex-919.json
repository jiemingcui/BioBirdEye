            "content": "<p>This protocol has been developed over the past decade in our lab to enable reliable high-throughput detection of gene expression by qRT-PCR in low input samples starting from 10 pg total RNA (single cells). We have used this protocol to measure gene expression in a wide variety of samples types, tissue treatments and disease contexts (<em>See associated publications</em>). The present version of this protocol was developed as part of the National Institutes of Health SPARC project efforts to construct a comprehensive anatomical, molecular and functional map of the peripheral nervous system at the visceral organs. A key goal is to develop an anatomical framework onto which various data sets can be mapped, e.g., spatial location and distribution of hundreds to thousands of single neurons within a tissue context, molecular profiles of spatially-tracked single neurons, etc.</p><p>Primarily designed to process single cells captured using Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) from fresh frozen tissue, it can be adapted to other low input samples such as cell culture samples (1-1000 cells), and extracted RNA (10 pg-1 ng). The workflow is comprised of four steps \u2013 cell lysis, reverse transcription, pre-amplification and qPCR.</p><p>Single cell samples are processed for reverse transcription (RT) directly from lysis without RNA extraction. This enables sample processing with no RNA loss due to the extraction process. Post RT, samples are pre-amplified with PCR primers (1-400 primers). This step selectively amplifies cDNA molecules to detectable levels for qPCR.&nbsp;Samples processed can be quantified on a traditional qPCR instrument using EvaGreen/Sybr green. Alternatively samples can be measured for the primers in pre-amplified cDNA using BioMark HD system (Fluidigm), a high-throughput qRT-PCR platform that enables detection of 96 samples with 96 genes/primers generating close to ten thousand data points per chip run.</p><p>For sample processing using BioMark HD system (Fluidigm) multiple sets of 96 or 48 samples (including positive and negative controls) can be processed through this protocol with multiple sets of 48 or 96 primers based on the type of BioMark Chip used (48.48 Chip, 96.96 Chip). For example; 2 x 96 =192 samples can be pre-amplified for 3 x 96 =288 genes and run on 6 BioMark 96.96 Chips (96 samples and 96 genes each) generating a data set of 55,296 points.</p><p>Standard qPCR training with robust pipetting skills is adequate to use this protocol for sample processing on a traditional qPCR instruments. For sample processing on BioMark HD system, training will be required to load samples on chips and on using BioMark instrument and software.</p><p>Pre-amplification of low input samples prior to qPCR enables robust detection of several hundred transcripts in a single cell. However, this step also limits the number of genes that can be detected to the set of primers used for pre-amplification. Transcripts that are not amplified during the pre-amplification process cannot be detected post processing. Additionally, this step involves PCR reaction where several hundred primers (primers in pre-amplification) interact with the same sample during pre-amplification. This enables dimer formation not only with a single primers forward and reverse sequences but with all the forward and reverse sequences for that experiment. Therefore, primer testing should be done post pre-amplification of positive controls to circumvent this issue.</p><p>The steps detailed below can be applied towards single cell samples obtained using LCM, cell culture samples and extracted RNA. Samples processed through the pre-amplification (Procedure 1.1) can be quantified using traditional qPCR (Procedure 1.2) or BioMark High-throughput qPCR (Procedure 1.3).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> See supplementary file for a user friendly pdf version of the protocol.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Single cell high-throughput qRT-PCR protocol combines high sensitivity technique of single cell qPCR with high-throughput qPCR technology that can generate data from 96 samples and 96 genes in a single experiment. It can be adapted for various sample types- cell culture, tissue samples and extracted RNA (10 pg) and measured on traditional qPCR and high-throughput qPCR platforms. The workflow is comprised of four steps \u2013 cell lysis, reverse transcription, pre-amplification and qPCR. Key features of this protocol are; processing low input samples directly to reverse transcription without RNA extraction which minimizes sample loss, pre-amplification enables amplification of cDNA from single cells to detectable levels for qPCR and&nbsp;measuring up to 400 genes from a single cell sample/10 pg of RNA (starting material). Robust, reproducible and versatile this protocol can be adapted to several upstream and downstream techniques.</p><p><br></p>",
