            "content": "Cell migration is a fundamental process in biology and essential for almost all types of immune responses. In recent years, dendritic cells \\(DCs) have become a widely used model system for rapidly migrating leukocytes<sup>2,4</sup>. DCs represent the pivotal link between innate and adaptive immunity. They reside in peripheral organs of the body, such as the skin, in an immature state where they constantly scan their environment for antigens. Upon antigen uptake, DCs start to mature, become highly migratory and follow chemokine gradients guiding them towards the next lymphatic vessel. From there, DCs travel to the draining lymph node and present the acquired antigen to T cells, eventually triggering the adaptive immune response<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\n\nOn their way from the periphery to lymph nodes, DCs are challenged with varying environments of different complexities. In recent years, three-dimensional \\(3D) collagen matrices have been successfully used to mimic this complexity and to study DC cell migration in vitro<sup>2</sup>. However, the complexity in the z-plane in these assays makes it very challenging to correlate e.g. cell speed or persistence with parameters like cell shape or the distribution of certain molecules. To this end we established a technique to manufacture geometrically complex microfluidic devices. At the same time, cells are confined in the z dimension. This enables the study of cell migration under full optical control in well-defined, geometrically complex environments."

            "content": "**Stage 1: Photolitography**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Design photomask in Coreldraw X18 or Autocad.\r\n  2. Convert file to Gerber format using Linkcad\r\n  3. Order class 4 photomask, 5\u201d square quartz, 1\u00b5 resolution from JD Photo data\r\n  4. For best results follow the Microchem protocol for SU8-2005\r\n  5. Take a 4\u201d wafer and bake at 110\u00b0C for 5 min. to remove water.\r\n  6. Spin coat SU-8 2005. Ramp to the final speed over 10 sec. and then spin coat at the final speed for 30sec.  For 5\u00b5m high structures use 3000 RPM, for 4\u00b5m high structures use 5000 RPM, and for 3.5\u00b5m structures use 8200 RPM\r\n  7. Soft bake on hotplate at 95\u00b0C for 2 min.\r\n  8. Expose 90 \u2013 105 mJ/cm2 on the EVG mask aligner\r\n  9. Post exposure bake 95\u00b0C for 3 min.\r\n  10. Develop SU-8 in SU-8 Developer\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Stage 2: Silanization of wafers**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Place the wafers in a wafer carrier. Place inside a vacuum desiccator inside a fume hood, together with a 15ml Falcon tube. Pipette 20\u00b5l of the silane into the falcon tube and eject the tip into it. Be careful with the silane, it is hazardous.\r\n  2. Apply vacuum on the dessicator, at least 0.1 bar.\r\n  3. Seal the desiccator and turn off the vacuum pump to allow the silane to vaporize\r\n  4. Wait 1h.\r\n  5. Vent the desiccator then put the cap back on the falcon tube and dispose as hazardous waste.\r\n  6. Wafers are now hydrophobic and coated with a monolayer of silane and PDMS will peel off easily.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Stage 3: Curing PDMS devices**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Make a 6\u201dx6\u201d square of aluminum foil. \r\n  2. Shape the aluminium foil around the wafer to make a circular tray. Place the wafer inside the tray and the tray inside a square petri dish.\r\n  3. Pour 10:1 PDMS \\(approximately 50g total) inside a Thinky mixer cup.\r\n  4. Mix the PDMS in Thinky mixer. Mix: 2000 RPM, 2 min., defoam: 2000 RPM, 2min.\r\n  5. Pour the mixed PDMS onto the wafer. \r\n  6. Put wafer in the dish in a vacuum desiccator. Pump out the remaining bubbles.  Vent as necessary to pop the bubbles.\r\n  7. Cover the petri dish and place in oven at 80\u00b0C overnight.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Stage 4: Dicing PDMS and plasma bonding**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Cut off all PDMS and foil off the back of the wafer using a razor blade.\r\n  2. Peel off the PDMS carefully. Work with it features facing upward and avoid touching the surface.\r\n  3. Cut the PDMS into small pieces according to the design.\r\n  4. Punch holes in the PDMS with a 2mm Harris Unicore biopsy punch. Alternatively use a 12 gauge blunt sharpened needle.\r\n  5. Clean the PDMS with scotch tape.\r\n  6. Place PDMS devices into beaker containing 70% ethanol\r\n  7. Sonicate beaker for 5 min., sweep\r\n  8. Devices are now ready to be plasma cleaned.\r\n  9. Setup a hotplate at approximately 85\u00b0C\r\n  10. Dry PDMS with an airgun. It is critical to make sure you remove all traces of ethanol. Ethanol will inhibit bonding of devices to glass. \r\n  11. Place the PDMS features face up along with #1.5 glass cover slips in plasma cleaner.\r\n  12. Start the vacuum pump and pump down until the plasma appears on high power for 2 min.\r\n  13. Turn off the equipment and remove the glass and PDMS from the plasma machine\r\n  14. Place cover slips on hot plate. For bonding, slightly press PDMS, features facing downward, onto cover slip. Wait 2h, 85\u00b0C.\r\n  15. For additional bonding one can place the bonded devices in the oven overnight at 80\u00b0C.\r\n  16. Glue cover slip bound PDMS device to Petri dish with hole using aquarium glue. Let the glue harden over night.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Stage 5: Introduction of cells**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Place dish with glued PDMS device into plasma cleaner. Remove the lid of the dish. Apply vacuum for 2 min., and then switch on plasma cleaner to high for another 2 min.\r\n  2. Pipette ~3ml of warm R10 on the PDMS device. Additionally flush the device through the punched holes. Make sure that there are no air bubbles inside the device. Incubate for 1h in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C/ 5% CO2.\r\n  3. Remove medium from the top of the PDMS device to ensure that liquids pipetted into the holes do not mix on top of the device.\r\n  4. Designate one hole for the chemokine, the other for the cells\r\n  5. Carefully remove 5\u00b5l of medium from the cell hole\r\n  6. Remove 10\u00b5l from the chemokine hole and replace with the same volume of chemokine\r\n  7. Carefully pipette 5\u00b5l of cell suspension \\(50.000 cells) into the hole for the cells\r\n  8. Put back into incubator. Cells will start to migrate and reach the maze after 2-3h.\r\n  9. Start imaging at microscope of choice."

In some cases it might also help to clean the cover slips before plasma cleaning. Immerse cover slips into 70% Ethanol, followed by sonication and drying with an airgun.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Stage 5:** _Introduction of cells._ It has been observed that cells will not enter the device from the hole where they have been injected when their concentration is too low. The concentration of the cell suspension used for injection should be between 5-10x106 cells/ml.\r\n\n\nIf the distance between the chemokine- and cell hole is too big it will take very long until the chemokine has diffused far enough to be sensed by the cells. As a rule of thumb, the distance between the two holes should not be much more than the diameter of the biopsy puncher \\(2mm)."
