            "content": "The kidneys have highly differentiated and complicated structures, and play critical roles in many physiological processes. Once damaged, kidneys rarely recover their functions. To overcome this problem, kidney regeneration using embryonic stem cells \\(ESCs)1-3 or induced pluripotent stem cells \\(iPSCs)4-6, which have an unlimited self-renewal capability and the potential to differentiate into any cell type in the body, is a valuable alternative. Kidneys are derived from IM, and Odd-skipped related 1 \\(Osr1) is one of the earliest markers specific for IM, although the expression also extends into the lateral plate mesoderm at early stages in mouse, chick and fish embryos7-9. The differentiation of PSCs into OSR1-expressing IM cells is the first step toward the induction of renal lineage cells10. In this protocol, we describe how to efficiently induce OSR1+ IM cells from hPSCs."

(b) The differentiated cells on day 18 were stained with antibodies or lectins against markers for IM derivatives: Lotus Tetragonobulus lectin (LTL) and Aquaporin (AQP1) for proximal renal tubule, Peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PODOCALYXIN for glomerular podocytes, CYTOKERATIN and E-CADHERIN for renal epithelia, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) and SALL4 for nephric duct and ureteric bud, GATA4, GATA6 and HSD3\u03b2 for the gonads or adrenal cortex, and \u03b1SMA for smooth muscle.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "The induction of kidney lineage cells from human pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs) has been previously described in some reports, but there have been no protocols so far for the robust induction of intermediate mesoderm \\(IM), an early embryonic germ layer that gives rise to kidneys. In the present study, we have established a robust induction protocol using combinational treatment of growth factors, which produces up to 90% IM cells expressing the IM-specific marker OSR1. This novel method thus supplies an unprecedented system to elucidate the mechanisms of IM development and potentially provide a cell source for kidney regeneration.",
