            "content": "A substantial proportion of proteins bind metals but there is no routine method for identifying metalloproteins. High resolution separation techniques generally exploit non-native conditions such that metals can be lost, replaced or acquired during chromatography. The use of reductants and chelators can alter metal-protein speciation, as can oxygen which is also liberated from electrodes. This protocol involves minimal protein fractionation under native conditions, sufficient to identify and quantify the major soluble metalloprotein pools by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Individual proteins are then further resolved under denaturing conditions. By using principal component analysis \\(PCA) to compare the change in abundance of each protein with the change in abundance of metal, a candidate metalloprotein is selected and then identified by peptide mass-fingerprinting. The distribution of the metalloprotein across multiple fractions becomes an asset to its subsequent identification. The method is suited to finding and quantifying the major soluble metalloproteins and to studying their metal supply. The protocol can be adapted to extract and separate cytoplasmic proteins under robustly anaerobic conditions"

Imaging should aim to achieve highest possible resolution while minimising background intensity. Multiple images may be required, integrated over different exposure times, to allow accurate quantification of all bands.\r\n\n\n9) Number each protein band observed in the gel consecutively from the highest MW to the lowest MW species.\r\n\n\n10) Quantify protein abundance from images of stained gels using commercially available software, such as ImageJ \\(NIH) or QuantityOne \\(Bio-Rad), by integrating under fluorescent peaks according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Column 1 must contain the metal concentrations \\(from section C), with column 2, 3, 4 containing the quantities of protein 1, 2, 3 \\(from section D). Row 1 should contain headings, with rows 2, 3, 4 representing gel lanes 1, 2, 3. Save spreadsheet as a .csv file with a unique filename \\(F4). Do not enter values in any other cell of the spreadsheet except for these metal and protein quantities, as this will prevent the PCA script from running properly.\r\n\n\n2) Copy the PCA script \\(see section F) into a MatLab script file using the MatLab editor, and save under the \u201cmetals.m\u201d filename. The script should be saved in the same folder that contains the .csv data file \\(F4). Open MatLab, select this folder as MatLab\u2019s working directory, and run script by entering \u201cmetals\u201d. When prompted, enter the filename of the .csv data file \\(F4). MatLab produces the graphical output in separate windows.\r\n\n\n3) In order to test that the PCA script provided is functioning correctly, an example dataset is given in table 1. Copy the data in table 1 into a spreadsheet, save with filename example.csv, and run the PCA script in MatLab as described above. The output should look like that depicted in figure 2.\r\n\n\n4) Recover the protein identified as best correlating species by PCA from the gel \\(section D) by excising band using a sterile scalpel under UV irradiation and transfer the gel slice to a fresh 1.5 ml PP tube.\r\n\n\n5) Wash and hydrate the gel slice with 50 \u03bcl H\n2\nO for 5 min, then destain with 50 \u03bcl of 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, in 50 % v/v acetonitrile for 30 min.\r\n\n\n6) Add 50 \u03bcl reduction buffer and incubate for 30 min at 56\u00baC, then add 50 \u03bcl of 100 mM iodoacetamide and incubate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.\r\n\n\n7) Wash the gel slice twice in 50 \u03bcl water for 5 min, then dehydrate by washing twice with 100 \u03bcl acetonitrile for 10 min at 30\u00baC.\r\n\n\n8) Dry under vacuum, re-hydrate on ice with 10 \u03bcl digestion buffer, and add 25 ng trypsin \\(Promega). After 10 min, add a further 10-25 \u03bcl digestion buffer to cover the gel slice and incubate at 35\u00baC for 16 h.\r\n\n\n9) Extract tryptic peptides twice with 10 \u03bcl 0.1 % v/v trifluoroacetic acid in 60 % v/v acetonitrile at 56\u00baC for 30 min.\r\n\n\n10) Pool extracts and dry under vacuum, then redissolve in 10 \u03bcl 0.1 % v/v trifluoroacetic acid.\r\n\n\n11) Purify with Zip-Tip C\n18\npipette tips \\(Millipore) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Elute peptides from the tip directly onto the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization \\(MALDI) plate with matrix solution of \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid \\(10 mg/ml) saturated in 50 % v/v acetonitrile, 0.1 % v/v trifluoroacetic acid.\r\n\n\n12) Analyse peptide digests using a MALDI-TOF-MS, equipped with a delayed ion extraction source. Our instrument uses a nitrogen laser at 337 nm and is operated in reflector mode at accelerating voltages of 20-25 kV.\r\n\n\n13) Obtain mass spectra over a mass range of 900-4,000 Da and assign monoisotopic peptide mass fingerprints.\r\n\n\n14) Identify protein species by searching the mass fingerprint data using the Mascot search engine program \\(Matrix Science Ltd.) by searching against the latest NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database with a peptide mass tolerance limit of 50 ppm.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**F) PCA script**\r\n\n\n_Format of data file_\r\n\n\nThe metals.m script will process any tabulated profile data, as long as it is provided in a file of the appropriate format. The key characteristics of the file are:\r\n\n\n1) The file should be a comma separated variable text file \\(.csv). Files of this type can easily be exported from spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel.\r\n\n\n2) The first row of the file should contain the column headings, these are used to label the profiles in resulting plots.   \r\n\n\n3) The first column of data should contain the profile of the metal of interest. For an example of the file layout see table 1.

Add 15 ml 50 mM Tris, pH 8.8 and thaw within chamber.\r\n\n\n6) Once thawed, transfer lysate to 2 x 13 ml PP tubes and seal anaerobically. Centrifuge \\(6,500 _g_, 20 min, 4\u00baC) to remove cell debris and intact cells.\r\n\n\n7) Return to anaerobic chamber, and transfer supernatant to ultracentrifuge tubes. Anaerobically seal inside rotor canisters in the chamber, then ultracentrifuge \\(160,000 _g_, 30 min, 4\u00baC).\r\n\n\n8) Resuspend pellet of cell debris and intact cells in 10 ml HPLC buffer and obtain cell count using cell counter \\(Casy TT, or equivalent) to determine fraction of cells successfully lysed.\r\n\n\n9) Transfer to chamber and decant supernatant into a fresh tube.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Low resolution native two-dimensional liquid chromatography:_\r\n\n\n1) Quantify total protein in extract by BSA-calibrated Coomassie assay according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Adjust protein concentration to below ==~== 3 mg/ml by addition of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.8.\r\n\n\n2) Load extract equivalent to 40 mg total protein onto 1 ml HiTrap Q HP column \\(previously equilibrated according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions with anaerobic buffers) in anaerobic chamber at ==~== 0.1 ml/min. A low flow rate is necessary to reduce back-pressure due to high viscosity of the sample.\r\n\n\n3) Wash and elute anion exchange column as described above. Store eluted fractions anaerobically until required.\r\n\n\n4) Resolve 200 \u03bcl aliquots of each fraction on a TSK-SW3000 column as described above. HPLC buffer should be degassed then purged with oxygen-free nitrogen to remove traces of O\n2\n, and HPLC liquid system should be sealed throughout to maintain anaerobic conditions.\r\n\n\n5) Perform metal analysis and SDS-PAGE as described above \\(sections C and D) under aerobic conditions.\r\n\n\n6) Perform PCA analysis as described in section E.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**H) Further applications**\r\n\n\nThe technique can be adapted for other applications. The use of liquid chromatography coupled to principal component analysis to determine which protein in a complex sample has a particular property should be generally applicable, provided the property can be quantified. For example, by replacing the metal concentrations used here with assays for enzymatic activities, fluorescence or UV/visible absorbance, and using principal component analysis to compare the rise and fall in abundance of each protein with the rise and fall of activity/fluorescence/absorbance. Further, applying PCA to the protein abundances alone can reveal the presence of protein-protein interactions within the complex protein mixture. Alternative methods to one dimensional SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for estimation of protein abundance, such as quantitative mass fingerprinting, can also be applied in an analogous manner."

Either ensure more rapid resuspension of cells into ice-cold water, or initially resuspend pellet in a small volume of Tris-sorbitol supernatant before adding the ice-cold H<sub>2</sub>O. If antibodies are available, the degree of cellular lysis can be determined using immunoblots.

Usually, a simple re-run is sufficient, as small variations in chromatography can be enough to alter the profile of individual protein species sufficiently to allow isolation of a single candidate by comparing multiple rounds of SDS-PAGE/PCA. If the problem persists, alter the separation criteria, for example by connecting two TSK-SW3000 size exclusion columns in series to improve the resolution of the second dimension separation, or change the size exclusion column to a different type, for example to a TSK-SW4000 column \\(Tosoh Bioscience) to resolve larger proteins. Alternatively, repeat the process using different NaCl concentrations to elute from the anion exchange column to improve resolution of the anion exchange separation of the area of interest, or to cause a change in the distribution of contaminating proteins. If the problem persists, the proteins may be interacting in a complex."
