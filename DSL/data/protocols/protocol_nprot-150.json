Visualization of site-specific phosphorylation in cells is of great importance not only to analyze its spatially and temporally distribution but also to speculate its biological function. Now, site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibodies are widely utilized as the most powerful tools for these analyses. This protocol details a method to produce the polyclonal version of such an antibody by immunizing a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to a protein phosphorylated at targeted site\\(s). To further examine biological roles on the site-specific phosphorylation of a target protein, this protocol includes a method to replace endogenous protein to exogenous phosphorylation-site mutant by both retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and RNA interference \\(RNAi). Each part of the protocol can be completed in 2-3 months.\r\n\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\r\n\n\nProtein phosphorylation is known to change the affinity toward its interacting partner, its enzymatic activity, its subcellular localization and so on. Such functional change of protein by phosphorylation is implicated in various aspects of cellular events such as signal transduction<sup>1, 2</sup>, cell cycle progression/checkpoint<sup>3, 4</sup>, cytoskeletal rearrangements<sup>5</sup> etc.  \r\n\n\nIn order to speculate the biological role\\(s) of protein phosphorylation in cells, it is of great importance to analyze the cellular protein phosphorylation. In the past, labelling of cells with radioactive phosphate had a widely used strategy to monitor in vivo phosphorylation of proteins. However, in this method, it is difficult to monitor not only the site-specific protein phosphorylation but also its spatial and temporal distribution.  In 1983, Sternberger&#x2019;s group reported that a subset of their neuron-specific monoclonal antibodies recognized specifically phosphorylated forms of proteins but not non-phosphorylated forms<sup>6</sup>. This study also demonstrated that use of such an antibody in the immunocytochemistry could lead to visualization of the intracellular distribution of protein phosphorylation<sup>6</sup>. However, the method by immunizing phosphorylated whole protein\\(s) has a very low chance of obtaining an antibody that can recognize a protein phosphorylated specifically at targeted residue\\(s). To overcome this difficulty, we employed a novel strategy of immunizing a phosphorylated peptide or a synthetic phosphopeptide, which corresponds to the protein phosphorylated at a targeted residue<sup>7-9</sup>. This method, which we first established in the world<sup>7, 8</sup>, has not only a greater chance of obtaining a phosphoepitope-specific antibody but also an advantage that one can predesign a targeted phosphorylation site\\(s)<sup>9</sup>. Our method has been applied to the production of antibodies that can specifically recognize the other types of site-specific protein modification, such as acetylation, methylation, and proteolysis<sup>9</sup>. At the first section of this protocol, we introduce methods of a polyclonal version of a site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibody. \r\n\n\nDetection of protein phosphorylation in cells leads to a question about its biological role\\(s). To solve the question, a protein mutated at phosphorylation site\\(s) is often introduced into cells. In order to prevent the phosphorylation of identified site\\(s) on the protein, Ser/Thr \\(S/T) or Tyr \\(Y) is often changed into Ala \\(A) or Phe \\(F), respectively. In some cases, mutation to Asp \\(D) or Glu \\(E) mimics the functional change of the protein phosphorylation in cells. However, even if the phosphorylation induced the functional change of the protein, the expression of the above mutant\\(s) does not always induce a remarkable phenotype of cells. One possible explanation is due to the existence of endogenous protein, which may function enough to show no remarkable phenotype by the mutant. In this case, it is required not only to express the mutant protein but also to reduce the endogenous one in cells. Knockin technology seems to be ideal for this purpose. However, establishment of the cells generally requires not only high skills but also a long time. To overcome the above difficulties, we employ a novel strategy by using small interfering RNA \\(siRNA) transfection<sup>10, 11</sup>. First, we established cells expressing an exogenous protein, which is insensitive to a siRNA of the endogenous one. Then, we transfected such cells with the siRNA specific to the endogenous protein. In this condition, the expression of endogenous protein is reduced but that of exogenous one is not affected. This technology is not only a powerful tool for analyzing the phenotype of mutant protein but also applicable to the rescue experiment of RNA interference \\(RNAi). At the second section of this protocol, we introduce this &#x201C;semi-replacement&#x201D; method."

Production of a site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibody by using a phosphopeptide**\r\n\n\n&#x2022;Synthetic peptides: Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated versions of peptides are designed to contain targeted residue\\(s) \\[phosphorylation site\\(s)] and the flanking 5 amino acids at both sides, because 5 or 6 amino acid residues are considered to constitute an antigen epitope recognized by an antibody molecule. In order to conjugate it to the carrier protein such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin \\(KLH), we usually introduce a Cys \\(C) residue at the amino-terminal side of the synthetic peptide. As an example, we show synthetic peptides for the production of an antibody<sup>10</sup>  against phosphoSer857 and phosphoSer858 on inner centromere protein \\(INCENP<sup>12</sup>) in Fig. 1.

Production of a phosphoepitope-specific antibody by using a phosphopeptide**\r\n\n\n**Immunization**\r\n\n\n**1|** The emulsification of adjuvant/antigen is one of the most important steps to obtain an excellent antibody. This step can be performed using option A and/or option B. Before immunization, it is hard to speculate which adjuvant system is suitable for the production of an appropriate antibody. So, we commend you to try both adjuvant systems. \r\n\n\nA) First option: Freund adjuvant system \\(water-in-oil emulsion)\r\n\n\n1. After the adjuvant \\(especially Freund complete adjuvant) has been mixed well, load a syringe with 0.5 ml adjuvant per1 rabbit. Use Freund complete or incomplete adjuvant for the first or booster injection, respectively.\r\n  2. Dilute the phosphopeptide-conjugated KLH with PBS to make a solution containing 0.2-0.4 mg ml\n-1\nphosphopeptide. Then, load another syringe with 0.5 ml antigen solution \\(corresponding to 0.1-0.2 mg phosphopeptide) per 1 rabbit.\r\n  3. Connect the above 2 two syringes via a 18 gauge double emulsifying needle. Mix the adjuvant with the antigen by forcing the materials back and forth through the needle.  \r\n  4. Push all of the emulsion into one syringe and disconnect the empty syringe.\r\n  B) Second option: RIBI adjuvant system \\(oil-in-water emulsion)\r\n\n\n1. Warm the vial to 40-45 \u00b0C for 5-10 min.\r\n  2. Dilute the phosphopeptide-conjugated KLH with PBS to make a solution containing 0.1-0.2 mg ml\n-1\nphosphopeptide. Using a syringe with a 21 gauge needle, inject 2 ml antigen solution \\(per 2 rabbits) directly into the vial through the rubber stopper. Leaving the cap seal and rubber stopper in place, vortex the vial. \r\n  3. Load a syringe with 1 ml emulsion \\(corresponding to 0.1-0.2 mg phosphopeptide) per 1 rabbit. Unused adjuvant/antigen emulsion can be stored at 4\no\nC for several months, unless the antigen is unstable. So, we use the remaining emulsion \\(1 ml) for the next booster injection.\r\n  **2|** This step is optional. Collect blood from each rabbit before the immunization in order to obtain the control serum. We usually obtain 0.5-1 ml preimmune serum from each rabbit. \r\n\n\n**3|** Immunize a rabbit by the injection of 1 ml prepared adjuvant/antigen emulsion \\(corresponding to 0.1-0.2 mg phosphopeptide). For Freund adjuvant system, inject the emulsion at multi-intradermal sites. For RIBI adjuvant system, inject the emulsion at the following sites; 0.05 ml per site \u00d7 6 intradermal, 0.3 ml intramuscular into each hind leg \\(total 2 sites), and 0.1 ml subcutaneous in neck region.\r\n\n\n**\\!CAUTION** Be careful for the needle-stick injury, which may lead to keloid formation, especially in the case of Freund\u2019s adjuvant system.\r\n\n\n**4|** Perform booster injections every 4 weeks.\r\n\n\n**5|** After 10-14 days from each booster injection, collect about 50 ml blood from each rabbit. Incubate the blood at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and stir at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Centrifuge each sample at 1,000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and collect each supernatant \\(serum).\r\n\n\n**6|** This step is optional. Incubate at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min in order to inactivate the complement system of the serum.\r\n\n\n**7|** Filtrate each serum sample with 0.22 \u03bcm filter. \r\n\n\n**8|** This step is optional. Check the titer of antibody against the phosphopeptide, by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA)\n16\n. \r\n\n\n**PAUSE POINT** Store in aliquots at -80 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Preparation of the affinity matrix**\r\n\n\n**9|** Prepare one 15 ml tube for each peptide. Swell 0.2 mg of TSKgel AF-Tresyl Toyopal650 with 1 ml of coupling buffer in each tube. The column bed volume reaches about 1 ml. Spin-down the gel matrix and remove the supernatant.\r\n\n\n**10|** Dissolve 1 mg of phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated peptide with 1 ml of coupling buffer. Check pH of the solution, which must be 8.0-9.0. Mix each peptide solution with 1 ml of the swollen matrix in a 15 ml tube.\r\n\n\n**11|** Rotate gently for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 \u00b0C on a rotor. \r\n\n\n**12|** Spin-down the gel matrix and remove the peptide solution. Wash with 10 gel volumes \\(10 ml) of blocking buffer. \r\n\n\n**13|** Add 10 gel volumes \\(10 ml) of blocking buffer and rotate additionally for 1-2 h at room temperature or for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n**14|** Spin-down the gel matrix and remove the blocking buffer. Equilibrate the gel matrix with TBS \\(for short-term storage) or the stock solution \\(for long-term storage). Store at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Purification of an antibody specific to the phosphopeptide**\r\n\n\n**15|** For the initial purification, we usually prepare 5 ml serum. Each step described below should be done in a cold room or at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n**16|** This step is optional. Dilute the serum prepared above with the equal volume of TBS.\r\n\n\n**17|** Mix the \\(diluted) serum with 1 ml of the non-phosphorylated peptide-coupled gel matrix in a suitable tube.\r\n\n\n**18|** Rotate the mixture end-over-end overnight. In this step, antibodies against non-phosphorylated peptide must be attached to the matrix.\r\n\n\n**19|** Load the mixture onto a suitable column \\(Muromac column etc.). Collect the flow-through. \r\n\n\n**20|** Wash the column with 1 ml of TBS and collect the flow-through, in order to get the remaining unattached antibody. Repeat this step 2-3 times. Mix all flow-through fractions and keep them at 4 \u00b0C before applying the next gel matrix. \r\n\n\n**21|** Wash the column with excess elution buffer \\(over 10 bed volumes), in order to remove the antibody against the non-phosphorylated peptide. After wash, equilibrate with stock solution \\(for long-term storage) or TBS \\(for immediate re-use). Check pH of the final flow-through fraction, which must be around 7.5.\r\n\n\n**22|** Repeat steps 17-21 \\(optional).\r\n\n\n**23|** Mix all flow-through fractions with 1 ml of the phosphopeptide-coupled gel matrix in a suitable tube.\r\n\n\n**24|** Rotate the mixture end-over-end overnight. In this step, antibodies specific to phosphopeptide must be attached to the matrix.\r\n\n\n**25|** Load the mixture onto a suitable column \\(Muromac column etc.). \r\n\n\n**26|** Wash the column with 10 bed volumes \\(10 ml) of TBS, twice.\r\n\n\n**27|** Wash the column with 10 bed volumes \\(10 ml) of wash buffer, twice.\r\n\n\n**28|** Wash the column with 10 bed volumes \\(10 ml) of TBS, twice.\r\n\n\n**29|** During the above washing steps, prepare 40 \u03bcl of neutralizing buffer in each collecting tube. Before the elution step, we recommend you to mix 0.5 ml elution buffer with 40 \u03bcl of neutralizing buffer and then check the pH of the mixture, which must be around 7.5. If not, change the volume of neutralizing buffer and check again.\r\n\n\n**30|** Elute the antibody with half bed volume \\(0.5 ml) of elution buffer using a stepwise elution. Collect each drop of elute into the tube prepared above. Mix immediately but gently in the tube. Repeat the elution 5-6 times.\r\n\n\n**31|** Apply 5-10 \u03bcl per elute to sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis \\(SDS-PAGE). Check its amount and purity of IgG, which can be detected as bands corresponding to 50-55 kDa \\(its heavy chain) and 20-55 kDa \\(its light chan).\r\n\n\n**32|** Collect the antibody-rich fractions \\(likely 2-3 fractions).\r\n\n\n**33|** This step can be performed using option A or option B.\r\n\n\nA) First option\r\n\n\nAdd about 0.05 volume of 20 mg ml\n-1\nBSA, in order to make the antibody solution containing 1 mg ml\n-1\nBSA.\r\n\n\nB) Second option:\r\n\n\nTransfer the antibody solution to Amicon Ultra \\(Millipore).

Production of a phosphoepitope-specific antibody by using a phosphopeptide**\r\n\n\n**Step 1, A)-3**\r\n\n\nPush the antigen into the adjuvant first, so that the aqueous phase enters the oil phase. Hold the syringes carefully so that they do not come apart from the double hub needle during emulsification. The formation of a water-in-oil emulsion is signaled by a sudden increase in viscosity. So, repeat mixing until more force is required to move the solution through the needle.\r\n\n\n**Step 1, B)-2**\r\n\n\nIt is important to form the oil-in-water emulsion completely. So, we usually vortex the vial for at least 30 min. And, invert the vial several times during the vortexing process in order to mix the oil adherent to the rubber stopper etc. \r\n\n\n**Step 30**\r\n\n\nThe pH of each elute should be immediately returned to a neutral pH.\r\n\n\n**Step 33**\r\n\n\nThe low protein concentration of the antibody solution may lead to the inactivation of antibody during storage. So, we recommend you to make at least 1 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> protein of the solution.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2. Semi-replacement from endogenous protein to exogenous protein by RNAi technique**\r\n\n\n**Step 41**\r\n\n\nIf the PCR products contain smaller DNA fragments other than expected major band in size.  Cut off the gel piece to purify the DNA fragment of interest.  Otherwise smaller bands might be preferentially recombined into the vector. \r\n\n\n**Step 51**\r\n\n\nShake the transformed competent cells in SOC medium for more than 30 min at 37&#xB0;C before plating so that the kanamycin-resistant gene can be sufficiently expressed.\r\n\n\n**Step 60**\r\n\n\nSplit exponentially growing cells, and the cell density at the time of transfection should be 70-80% confluent.  If the cells reached confluent, trypsinize cells and seed them again.  If the cells are less than 50% confluent, postpone the transfection several hours later.  Either lower or higher confluency results in lower transfection efficiency and lower yield of viruses.\r\n\n\n**Step 63**\r\n\n\nDNA solution should be sterile.  After ethanol precipitation of plasmid DNA, dissolve the DNA with sterile TE buffer.  \r\n\n\n**Step87**\r\n\n\nPuromycin is very effective for selection of broad range of cell types with relatively narrow range of drug concentration, i.e., 0.5 to 2 &#x3BC;g ml<sup>-1</sup>.  Generally only a few days are required for drug selection."

            "content": "**1. Production of a phosphoepitope-specific antibody by using a phosphopeptide**\r\n\n\nThe specificity of a purified antibody should be assessed with immunoblotting analyses etc. As an example, we show the analyses of specificity of a purified antibody against  phosphoSer857 and phosphoSer858 on INCENP \\(referred to as AK8578) in Fig. 3. \r\n\n\nAurora-B was known to phosphorylate INCENP at Ser857 and Ser858 through their complex formation in cells<sup>19, 20</sup>. So, for the characterization of AK8578, we used the lysate of COS7 cells transfected with various combinations of Myc-Aurora-B and INCENP-HA<sup>10</sup>. AK8578 immunoreactivity to INCENP was observed only in cells where INCENP wild type \\(WT) is expressed together with Aurora-B WT \\(Fig. 3a). The immunoreactivity was abolished by Aurora-B mutation at Lys109 to Arg \\(K/R) which loses its catalytic activity or INCENP mutation at Ser857 and Ser858 to Ala \\(Fig. 3a). These data indicated that AK8578 specifically recognizes INCENP phosphorylation at Ser857 and Ser858.\r\n\n\nBy utilizing this antibody, we demonstrated that INCENP phosphorylation at Ser857 and Ser858 occurred specifically in mitosis<sup>10</sup> \\(Fig. 3, b and c).\r\n\n\n**2. Semi-replacement from endogenous protein to exogenous protein by RNAi technique**\r\n\n\nEach protein level should be assessed with quantitative techniques, such as quantitative immunoblotting \\(Fig. 4a). However, in some cases, there is little difference in the SDS-PAGE motility between endogenous and exogenous protein of interest \\(Fig. 2a). So, you may not determine the knock down efficiency of each protein by immunoblotting with the antibody that reacts both proteins. In this case, PCR-based quantitative technique may be an alternative method to determine the knock down efficiency of each protein \\(Fig. 4b). \r\n\n\nThe key to this protocol is the design of siRNA which reduce the endogenous protein but not the exogenous one. In some cases, a one- or two-base-pair change may have unanticipated effects by converting a siRNA into miRNA, which may also reduce the expression of its related sequence of protein, such as exogenous \\(introducing) protein. So, we recommend that you use a siRNA with more than 3-base-pair nucleotide mismatch for exogenous \\(introducing) protein."
