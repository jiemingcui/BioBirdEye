            "content": "CAUTIONARY NOTES OR SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n \n\nIMR90 cells are not known to be hazardous; however, they were derived from human samples and should be handled under BSL-2 precautions. Researchers should wear appropriate personal protective equipment during the completion of this protocol. A face shield should be worn while handling liquid nitrogen and cell vials that have been recently removed from liquid nitrogen storage as they may explode unexpectedly.\n\n \n\nParental stocks of IMR90-ATCC cells were obtained from ATCC at passage 10 and frozen at both passage 13 (on 8/28/2017) and passage 14 (on 8/31/2017). Since that time, we have started tracking cell growth in population doublings to obtain a more accurate representation of relative cell age. Thus, upon thawing of either passage 13/14 cells they are labeled with an \u201cadjusted population doubling\u201d (APD) of 0. Thereafter, their growth will be recorded by the addition of the calculated number of population doublings per passage. APD values for IMR90s will often increase by 2.0-2.5 per passage early in their lifespan and decrease to between 1.5-2.0 over time in culture. When the APD is regularly below 1.3, which typically takes about 12 passages according to the method described below, a new set of cells should be thawed.\n\n \n\nBicarbonate buffered solutions used for cell culture, such as growth medium and DPBS, should be \u201cre-gassed\u201d after each usage to facilitate the maintenance of proper pH. This can be accomplished by placing bottles in a tissue culture incubator for 15-30 minutes with the cap loosened, but still on the neck of the bottle, prior to closing/tightening the cap and storing at 4 \u00b0C until the next usage. \n\n \n\nEach user should have their own bottles of DPBS and growth medium to avoid cross contamination of cultures. Further, specific sets of growth medium, DPBS, and trypsin should be used for each cell line/type being maintained by each user.          "

Prepare a 1:1 dilution of the cell suspension in trypan blue (50 \u03bcL trypan blue + 50 \u03bcL cell suspension) in an Eppendorf tube.\n12. Count cells that exclude trypan blue (\ni.e.\n, appear clear) on both sides of a hemocytometer (do not use an automated cell counter as these cells display variability in size and are not accurately quantified by automated methods).\na.\nNOTE\n: Blue staining of cells indicates a damaged membrane.\u00a0Blue-stained cells are considered to be non-viable.\n13.

Dilute cells to 4.0 x 10\n4\ncells/mL in growth medium in a 50 mL tube (or larger sterile bottle based on needed volume) to the total volume that will be used for plating (10 mL for each 10 cm plate and 25 mL for each 15 cm plate, making 2-5 mL extra).\n16. Mix thoroughly by inverting 10 times and dispense the diluted cell suspension into each dish.\u00a0Distribute cell suspension on the dish through a combination of gentle rocking and swirling of the dish for approximately 15 seconds.\n17. Place in a tissue culture incubator.\u00a0Cells will be ready to split three days after plating.\na.\nNOTE:\nPlating cells at a determined cell density will result in more predictable sub-culture and more reproducible performance in subsequent experimental assays.\n18.
