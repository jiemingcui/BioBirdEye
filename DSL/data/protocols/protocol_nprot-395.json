            "content": "We report a protocol that employs direct coating of smaller hapten on microtiter ELISA plates for the detection of low molecular weight analytes such as pesticides in an immunoassay format. In this method, the polystyrene surface of microtiter plates was functionalize with amino groups using 3-aminoprpyltriethoxysilane \\(APTES) for the covalent linkage to small molecular hapten with carboxyl groups. The developed immunoassay format could be used as convenient quantitative tool for the sensitive and rapid screening of pesticides and other low molecular weight analytes in samples. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Introduction**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nImmunological methods such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA) are increasingly becoming important for pesticides residual analysis due to the high inherent selectivity of detecting molecules, i.e., antibodies. The fact that antibodies could be made virtually against any substance, and its usages in developing highly sensitive assay makes this approach quite useful for the analysis of these toxic molecules<sup>1-4</sup>. These assays apart from being highly specific, exhibit the desired sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of low molecular weight contaminants present in our environment<sup>5-8</sup>. \r\n\n\nAn ELISA for small molecules, in general, needs conjugates of the hapten with large carrier protein for coating the wells of microtiter plates. The formation of such conjugates is not always reproducible. This makes it difficult to evaluate hapten-protein stoichiometry and to understand the precise orientation of the hapten on the protein<sup>9</sup>.  It has been observed that protein molecules immobilized on a hydrophobic polystyrene surface by passive adsorption lose their activity and suffer considerable denaturation<sup>10</sup>. These macromolecules are found to better retain their functional activity when immobilized through extended hydrophilic spacer arms, since sorption on the surface is substantially reduced<sup>11</sup>. \r\n\n\nA polystyrene surface can be modified to improve its hydrophilicity by incorporating various functional groups such as hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, carboxyl etc. on its surface<sup>12-13</sup>. However, the direct attachment of hapten molecules to a polystyrene surface is not possible due to the lack of available functional groups on polystyrene. In order to avoid these drawbacks, a method for direct attachment of carboxylated hapten on polystyrene support for binding the biomolecules on modified polystyrene surface was recently reported by our group<sup>14-15</sup>. In this assay format, we describe a method for generating amino groups on polystyrene microtiter wells using simple one-step aqueous silanization method for binding carboxylated hapten to develop a highly sensitive immunoassay format for hapten \\(Fig. 1). This method allowed us to link carboxylated hapten to amine grafted polystyrene microtiter plates for the quantification of 2,4-D pesticide. Hapten specific antibodies against 2,4-D was used in the present assay format, which shows high degree of assay sensitivity."

The amine modified PS surface was used for demonstrating binding of carboxylated hapten for immunoassay applications. This method allowed us to link carboxylated hapten to amine grafted polystyrene microtiter plates for the quantification of 2,4-D pesticides. Hapten specific antibodies against 2,4-D were used in the present assay format showing high degree of assay sensitivity. \r\n\n\nBinding of hapten to microtiter plate was highest when wells were treated first with 47% HNO<sub>3</sub> in concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> \\(250 &#xB5;l/well) followed by APTES treatment at pH 4 for making plates amino functionalized. This was confirmed by measuring the loading of antibody on hapten coated microtiter plates by ELISA.  The results showed that the absorbance of antibody bound to hapten coated plate at pH 6.9 was 1.749 absorbance unit \\(AU) by using nitrated-PS wells in comparison to untreated PS surface which showed 0.63 AU at pH 6.9.  The electron withdrawing nitro groups on PS surface drives the electrophilic attack of the silane group to its meta position enabling the binding of the APTES molecules to the PS surface, as demonstrated previously.   \r\n\n\nThe binding of hapten to the microtiter plates was examined using the direct hapten coated plates by using rabbit anti-2,4-D antibody on microtiter plate \\(Fig. 2).  The sensitivity of the assay obtained by using direct hapten coated plates was about 10 folds higher than the assay performed with hapten-protein conjugate16 \\(as a positive control) with very high degree of reproducibility \\(Fig. 3). This was mainly because of retention of functional activity of hapten molecules on polystyrene plates. No loss of functional activity of hapten molecules which is an organic moiety was observed, as reported in case of biomolecular immobilization on polystyrene plates. \r\n\n\nAnother advantage of the direct hapten coated microtiter plate is its long term storage ability since the coated plate did not show any significant loss in its antigenicity with anti-hapten antibodies, unlike reported where the significant antigenicity of hapten was lost when glutamic acid coated plates prepared by the direct glutaraldehyde activation method were tested after 4 days storage16. This protocol may find wide application as a convenient quantitative tool for sensitive screening of pesticides and other low molecular weight analytes in samples."
