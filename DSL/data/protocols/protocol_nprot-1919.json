            "content": "1.Prepare Evans Blue\nPrepare the   EB solution for injection in 0.9% saline at a concentration of 50 mg/ml.   Sonicate. Once prepared, the solution can be stored at 4\u00baC.\nTIP\n:\nIt is advisable to prepare in advance.\n2.Prepare   capsaicin cream\nMix 22.6% of Base L-200, 3.7% of Propylene   glycol and 73.7% of distilled water and then add 1.6 % of capsaicin   powder. Store at room temperature.\n3. Preparation and   collection of the tissue\na.\nCut aluminium   foil into 7-8 cm square pieces and label them with sample numbers.\nb.\nPrepare Pentobarbital working solution for anesthetizing the rats.\nc.\nInject the anaesthesia intraperitoneally \\(50 mg/Kg) depending on the   weight of the rat and wait until it is deeply anesthetized.\nd.\nCut carefully the vibrissae on both sides of the snout with curved   scissors.\ne.\nApply the depilatory cream to the   whisker pad area and leave for 7 or 8 minutes.\nf.\nRemove the cream with a flat spatula, taking care not to injure or   irritate the area.\ng.\nRinse the area with a gauze   wet in distilled water\nh.\nPrior to the injection of   EB, vasodilatation should be induced in the tail vein for easier   cannulation. Immerse the rat tail in warm water to induce vein   vasodilatation and improve their visualization.\nTIP:\nBe careful not to overheat the water to prevent flaking of the   skin. Temperature should not exceed 43\u00baC. Infrared lamps can be used, as   well as vasodilating agents such as Xylazine and Acepromazine.\ni.\nInject the prepared EB solution \\(50 mg/kg of 50 mg/ml solution)   intravenously in the lateral vein of the tail with an insulin needle at a   rate of 0.01 ml/g of animal weight\n\\(Figure 1A)\n. The   lateral veins are located on both sides of the centerline of the tail   and are very shallow so that the injection should be almost parallel to   the surface. Once injected, remove the needle and press the injection   site with cotton to stop bleeding. Time should be measured from the   moment the skin turns blue.\nTIP:\nMake sure that   the vein is not broken during the injection and all the EB is injected   properly. It is best to begin the injection into the distal part of the   tail. If a lump is formed at the injection site, it means that the vein   is broken, and a subsequent injection should be performed more   proximally. In this case the syringe should be refilled to replace any   lost volume of EB.\nj.\nFive minutes after the   injection, apply capsaicin or vehicle cream \\(according the group it   belongs to) in the whisker pad area on both sides of the snout.\nk.\nWait 10 minutes after application of the cream and remove the cream   with the aid of a gauze\n\\(Figure 1B)\n.\nl.\nPerfuse the animal through the ascending aorta with saline.\nm.\nQuickly remove the whisker pads. Dissect the area between the nose and   the inferior lip. Remove the top layers \\(about 5 mm in depth) making   sure not to include the intraoral epithelium.\nn.\nWrap each pad separately in a piece of aluminium foil, leaving the upper   side of the package open to allow better drying.\n4.   Tissue processing\na.\nPlace the tissue in   aluminium foil in an oven at 56\u00baC for two days to dry.\nb.\nAfter two days, take the tissue out of the oven and immerse each one of   the samples in a plastic tube with formamide to extract the EB out of   the tissue. Add 8 ml of formamide per 1 g of dry tissue.\nTIP:\nCover the tubes with aluminum foil.\nc.\nLeave the plastic tubes containing the sample embedded in formamide in   an oven at 56\u00baC over two days.\nd.\nAfter two days in   the oven, extract the formamide with a pipette \\(it should be blue) to a   covered, labelled eppendorf tube and discard the tissue.\ne.\nPrepare the dilutions for the standard curve: dilute EB in the   formamide solution in exponential concentrations. The concentrations   used in our study, adjusted to the level required for the absorbance of   the samples obtained, were as follows:\n0 ; 1 ; 2 ; 4 ; 8 ; 16 ; 32 ;   64 ; 128 \u03bcg/ml\nTIP:\nPrepare just before   measuring the absorbance of the samples. A standard curve is necessary   for each experimental session\nf.\nTake 200 \u03bcl of   the formamide extracted from each sample and put each one in a   different well of a P96 multiwell plate. In the same plate put 200 \u03bcl of   the corresponding dilutions for the standard curve.\nh.\nMeasure the absorbance with the help of a spectrophotometer at a   wavelenght of 620 nm. We use the program Shortcut to Spf.\n5.   Data fit\na.\nObtain absorbance values from   the solutions forming the standard curve. These values should grow   exponentially \\(\nTable 1\n).\nb.\nAdjust   the standard curve to a theoretical sigmoidal curve. The regression   parameters \\(a, b, x\n0\n, y\n0\n) can be estimated from   the experimental absorbance data using any statistical program \\(such as   Sigma Plot 8.0). Then, the non-linear regression formula is applied:\ny=y\n0\n+a/\\(1+exp\\(-\\(x-x\n0\n)/b))\nwhere   the independent variable x indicates the concentration, the dependent   variable y refers to the absorbance and a theoretical standard curve is   obtained \\(\nFigure 2\n). This allows us to calculate any   point with respect to the formula, thus obtaining a set value.\nc.\nExtrapolate the concentration of extravasated EB obtained in the study   from the known concentrations of EB and formamide measured in the   standard curve obtained in step\n5b\n. The values can be   calculated by isolating the variable x from the previous equation:\nx=x\n0\n-ln\\(\\(-y+y\n0\n+a)/\\(y-y\n0\n))   ** b\nd.\nTIP\n:_this step is necessary   if the tissue collection and spectrophotometric analysis was performed   on various days. If all spectrophotometry measurements were obtained in   one session, this step can be skipped._\nAfter obtaining the x value,   all data should be normalized for comparison with each of those obtained   in different experimental sessions. The data are normalized with   respect to the cut off point x\nc\nthat is given by assuming   that the derivative of the sigmoid curve at x=x\nc\nis equal to   0.0005,\ndy/dx \\(x=x\nc\n) = 0.0005\nThis very low arbitrary   value establishes that at the cut off point, the absorbance curve is   saturated \\(practically unchanged, as indicated by a derivative close to   zero).\nFinally, x concentrations are converted into dimensionless   magnitudes by transforming them into percentages with respect to x\nc\n%   = x ** 100/x\nc\nThis procedure allows for normalizing the   data from different experimental sessions on separate days, which   otherwise would lead to non-comparable data."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Plasma extravasation is one of the characteristic symptoms of an inflammatory response and of neurogenic inflammation, a phenomenon which occurs following nerve damage, and can lead to significant changes in the control of the cutaneous circulation<sup>1</sup>. Evans Blue binds with high affinity to serum albumin, and the complex has been often used to quantitatively assess the extent of extravasation that accompanies peripheral and neurogenic inflammation<sup>2,3</sup>. Here we present a protocol for evaluating Evans Blue extravasation in rodents with the aid of local application of capsaicin to initiate a neurogenic response exciting the local nociceptors, causing pain, axon reflex vasodilatation and plasma extravasation due to local release of inflammatory mediators. The method is inexpensive, precise and efficient, and can be adapted to assess extravasation in a range of experimental pathological conditions such as parotitis<sup>4</sup> or craniofacial muscle inflammation<sup>5</sup>, and their dependence on different proteins, receptors or pharmacological treatments<sup>6-9</sup>, in addition to those eliciting neurogenic inflammation.</p>",
