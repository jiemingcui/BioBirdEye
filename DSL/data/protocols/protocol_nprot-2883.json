            "content": "Immobilization of enzymes on synthetic polymers is of particular interest because of their application in clinical laboratories, biosensors, membrane bioreactors, and diagnostics \\(2, 3). Different methods are adopted for immobilization of biomolecules on a polymer surface, e.g., entrapment, encapsulation, adsorption, and covalent binding. Covalent immobilization is often necessary for binding the biomolecules that do not adsorb, adsorb very weakly, or adsorb with improper orientation and conformation to the polymer surfaces. Covalent immobilization may result in better biomolecular activity, reduced nonspecific adsorption, and greater stability \\(4\u20137). The available methods for modifying solid supports for covalent immobilization of biomolecules suffer from one or more drawbacks \\(8\u201310). The photolinker-mediated technique permits covalent binding of a protein ligand to solid surfaces under gentle reaction conditions \\(11). This method is normally based on a compound having at least two functional groups, one of which is essentially a photoactivable group. There are different methods available for immobilization of ligands on a surface through a photolinker. Nevertheless, in most of the methods, either the photoactive compound is expensive or its preparation is tedious and time consuming \\(12).  One of the advantages of using 1-Fluoro-2-nitro-4-azidobenzene \\(FNAB) is its simple and easy preparation.   The present protocol is useful for versatile applications in the field of surface engineering, immobilization and diagnostics involving microfluidic devices, biochips and biosensors."

Activation of the polystyrene microtiter plate was checked by immobilizing HRP on the activated wells and subsequently assaying the immobilized enzyme colorimetrically. \r\n\n\n\u2022 To determine the optimum time, we exposed the photolinker-coated surface to UV light for 5, 10, 20, and 40 min, respectively. With the plates activated for 40 min a high absorbance value was recorded for the enzyme after assay. However, at the end of this period, the polystyrene surface became discolored \\(colorless to light yellow). UV irradiation of the FNAB-coated surface for 20 min was found to result in effective immobilization.  \r\n\n\n\u2022 Control experiments without the photolinker showed much lower values of absorbance. Rapid immobilization of the enzyme on the activated surface was another advantage of this method. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Any polymer can be activated by this method using FNAB. We have subsequently activated polypropylene \\(14), polyethylene \\(14), cellulose \\(15), Polycarbonate \\(16) polystyrene cuvets \\(17), and polyethylene glycol \\(18).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Also, any biomolecule having active nucleophilic group can be covalently linked to activated polymers prepared by this method such as 5'-aminated oligonucleotides \\(19).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Instead of UV light, even sunlight can be used for activation of polymers \\(20)."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Introduction of functional group to an inert polymer is a very challenging and time consuming task.  This protocol describes a simple and mild procedure for the preparation of an activated polymer surface, used for immobilization of a protein ligand through a covalent linkage \\(1). Activation of the polymer surface is carried out by attaching an active functional group through 1-fluoro-2-nitro-4-azidobenzene \\(FNAB). UV irradiation of FNAB transforms its azido group into a highly reactive nitrene, which binds with the inert polymer surface, whereas the active fluoro group of FNAB, now part of the polymer, remains intact. Covalent linkage between the ligand and the inert surface is established through this active fluoro group in a thermochemical reaction without addition of any catalyst or reagent. The method can be used for activation of different inert polymer surfaces having carbon hydrogen bonds. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated by immobilizing horseradish peroxidase on an activated polystyrene surface. The enzyme, immobilized through the photolinker, is found to give a twofold increase in absorbance with the substrate as compared to the directly adsorbed enzyme. The method may have many applications in the preparation of bioreactors, biostrips, and biosensors, and in diagnostic tests involving the ELISA technique.",
