place SMEM for conditioning only after attainment of 70% confluence in fibroblast culture as higher confluence can change the fitness of the conditioned-medium; harvest conditioned medium exactly after 48h of medium-conditioning; delay in freeze-storage at -20\u00b0C may also influence the fitness of conditioned medium for stem cell culture; freeze-store immediately at -20\u00b0C.\nNote:\nCollection of Low-Ca\n2+\nconditioned-medium long after 48h of conditioning may result in overgrowth; prolonged Calcium starvation may also result in detachment of fibroblast leading to suspension of cells in conditioned-medium and changing its suitability for stem cell culture.\n1.6  EpSC passage and long-term culture\n1.6.1 After achieving 80-90% confluence in primary culture, trypsinize \\(1-2min) using trypsin-EDTA;

Isolate EpSC from tail skin at any age of the animal;\nthe advantage is less hair density in tail skin and low hindrance in separation of dermis & epidermis.\n3.1 Animal preparation\n3.1.1 Wash mice with betadine and then with 70%ethanol for processing as earlier \\(STEP # 1.1.4-1.1.5).\nCAUTION\\!\nCut open tail ventrally through ventral fascia avoiding damage to ventral artery located in that area; start de-skinning from ventral side over to dorsal side so as to keep the epidermis flap intact yielding an uncut piece.\nNote:\nIt is easy to start de-skinning from ventral side and removing the cartilage adhered on dermis using scalpel; scaly skin does not hinder in epidermis isolation.\n3.2  Skin  excision\n3.2.1 Cut the tail from base \\(i.e. at the joint with trunk) and excise up to 2cm from the tip; cut the specimen into three pieces; and remove sub-cutaneous fat.\n3.2.2  Place excised skin into PBS-antibiotic solution.\n3.2.3  Wash sample as described previously \\(STEP # 1.2.9 -1.2.12).\n3.2.4  Place dermal side down in dispase solution and allow to digest \\(see STEP 1.3.1-1.3.3).\n4 EpSC preparation from adult mouse ear-skin\n\\(Timing 5h)\nHere also the procedure is primarily based on the method developed for preparation of primary keratinocytes from adult mouse ear-skin\n10\n. EpSC could be isolated from ear-skin at any age of the mouse. Advantage is again less hair density, low hindrance in separation of dermis & epidermis, and ease to get infection free skin.\n4.1 Animal preparation\n4.1.1 Wash mice first with betadine and then with 70%ethanol \\(see STEP # 1.1.4 -1.1.5).\n4.2 Skin excision\n4.2.1 Cut ear-pinnae from the head-joint.\nCAUTION\\!\nAvoid hairy pat at the joint; start to peel skin gently from ventral area over to dorsal side; this way of dissection eases the peeling-process otherwise starting to peel from dorsal area fragments the tissue and yields bad specimen.\n4.2.2 Peel ear skin along the side of cartilage and place in PBS-antibiotic mixture.\n4.2.3 Wash tissue specimen as described previously \\(STEP # 1.2.9-1.2.12).\n4.2.4 Remove cartilage and subcutaneous fat using scalpel & blade.\nCAUTION\\!\nRemove cartilage very carefully as continuous scrapping may lead to loss of epidermis.\n4.2.5 Place ear skin dermis side down in dispase solution allowing digestion as previously \\(STEP #1.3.1-1.3.3)\n5.

            "content": "Using above protocol, an enriched population of multipotent Stem Cell \\(EpSC) from mouse skin \\(neonate/adult) could be isolated and cultured \\(Figure-1&amp;2). The in-vitro culture \\(Figure-3a-d) could be maintained up to multiple \\(&gt;20) passages.<br /> \r\n\n\nThe keratinocyte-isolates contained cells of different size. After rapid adherence \\(in 10min) to fibronectin-collagen substratum \\(Figure-2a), a sub-set of only small cells proliferates rapidly within 24h. The adherent cells demonstrate the cuboidal morphology after 48h in culture and are small in size compared to non-adherent cells. The adherent cells start growing after 7d of culture and gain confluence in Growth Promoting Mediu \\(Figure-2b, c). The quick growth of EpSC may be relevant to experimental application of stem cells. Differentiation in cultured cell population can be observed. A hike in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 0.05mM to 0.1mM switches on differentiation and causes detachment of cells from fibronectin-collagen substratum enabling these to float-out into the medium \\(Figure-2d). This phenomenon is known to operate in basal cells. Activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch renders the keratinocyte to differentiate. Basal cells are known to grow in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> media. To isolate &amp; culture stem cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> free media and supplements are used.<br /> \r\n\n\nDifferent type of growth pattern, such as bird-in-nest-like, island-like, and slab-stone-like, could be seen in colonies cultivated after different passage. A large nucleus to cytoplasm \\(N/C) ratio is apparent after the 2<sup>nd</sup> passage. Cultured stem cells could be cryopreserved in liquid-N<sub>2</sub> for long term after 17<sup>th</sup> passage in culture. Cryo-preserved EpSC could be reseeded and re-cultured in vitro. Cells gain confluence and become highly proliferative in a week after seeding. In re-culture, EpSC exhibit the typical cuboidal morphology \\(Figure-3a to d). This protocol works equally well to isolate and culture stem cells from adult mouse tail skin and adult mouse ear skin. Irrespective of the source \\(neonate/adult skin), dispase enzyme digests specimens better enabling easy peeling of epidermis from dermis and yield of more live cells for culture compared to non-enzymatic method. In case of neonates, incubation of skin specimens with dispase for 12h works better. However, in case of adult skin specimens, incubation with Trypsin-EDTA for 30min additionally after dispase for 12h is optimum. Hairless skin specimens are relatively less cumbersome to sterilize and yield infection-free keratinocyte-isolates. Epidermis-grafts of hair-less stem cell can be helpful for cosmetic surgery.<br /> \r\n\n\n BrdU \\(Label) integration and retention can be examined in keratinocyte-isolates to identify LRCs. In literature, LRCs are identified preferably as slow-cycling stem cells. BrdU-label can be detected using immuno-cytochemical technique \\(Figure-4&amp;8) or using FACS \\(Figure-9). Results demonstrate convincingly the label-retention in cultured stem cells.<br /> \r\n\n\nBoth EpSC isolates and cultured stem cells can be examined for positive or negative markers to authenticate stem cell preparation. Rapidly-adherent cells \\(EpSC) express candidate biomarkers as seen in Figure-5 to 6. A number of specific markers viz. cytokeratin K-19, K-15, K -14, p63, beta-1-integrin, CD34 test positive \\(Figure-7) whereas cytokeratin K-10 tests negative. K-15, K-19, and K-14 show over expression. The expression of p63 is remarkable. Beta-1-integrin and CD-34 markers also test positive. Taken together, this protocol confirms the identity of culture-harvested cells as EpSC and validates the protocol.<br /> \r\n\n\nFACSAria based validation of cultured-EpSC \\(in 3<sup>rd</sup> passage) can be attempted using DAPI exclusion method \\(Figure-10a). Results show that the cells showing least uptake of dye \\(i.e. those excluded dye) locate in P4 gate. As evident \\(Figure-10b), a sum of 88% cells excludes Hoechst dye and can therefore be identified as stem cells. However, a fraction of 2% cells retain relatively more dye and thus form a different sub-set located in a different gate. These cells cannot be considered as live cells for the reason of retaining more dye and hence identified as the TA cells.<br /> \r\n\n\nFACSAria based sorting of neonate keratinocyte-isolates using double dye method yields result as summarized in Figure-11. FACSAria based gating identifies the cells that exclude/retain Hoechst Dye/Propidium iodide respectively sorting the ample-pure population of stem-cell/TA-cell. SSC vs. FSC plot of keratinocyte isolates \\(5X10<sup>6</sup> cells) from neonate skin reveal that cells cluster into different areas \\(Figure-11a). The PI vs. FSC plot reveals a clustering of live cells in Gate P-1 \\(Figure-11b). It segregates live cells assembling in Gate P-1 away from dead cells that retain PI. Comparison of Hoechst Dye \\(DAPI) vs. PI uptake &amp; retention by specimen cells present in Gate P-1 sort the live cell population into dye excluding population of stem cells in Gate P-3 &amp; dye retaining population of TA cells in Gate P-2 \\(Figure-11c). Post-sorted live TA cell population captured in Gate P-2 can be verified through SSC vs. FSC plot \\(Figure-11d). Post-sorted live TA cell population captured in Gate P-2 was verified also through PI vs. FSC plot \\(Figure-11e). Verification of post-sorted live TA cell population captured in P2 compartment for its characteristics of TA cells is shown in Figure-11f. Post-sorted live stem cell population captured in Gate P-3 can be verified through SSC vs. FSC plot \\(Figure-11g). Verification of post-sorted live cell population captured in Gate P-3 through PI vs FSC plot gives expected results. Cells falling in the Low PI &amp; Low FSC quadrant confirm these cells to be the live stem cells \\(Figure-11h). Post-sorted live stem cell population captured in Gate P-3 collect in the quadrant representing low PI and low Hoechst dye uptake verifying their stem cell characteristic \\(Figure-11i).<br /> \r\n\n\nA similar exercise of FACSAria based size-dependent sorting of adult mouse epidermis keratinocyte-isolates into ample-pure TA &amp; stem-cell population reveals similar results \\(Figure-12). Small &amp; large cell fractions can be segregated using SSC vs. FSC plot into Gate P-1 and Gate P-2 respectively \\(Figure-12a). Large-cell population clusters in Gate P-2. It can be sorted by PI vs. Hoechst Dye intensity plot determination. The PI stained dead cells segregates into quadrant Q1 &amp; Q2 \\(scatter-plot statistics 9%); Hoechst dye excluding live stem cells in quadrant Q3 \\(scatter-plot statistics 4%); and Hoechst dye retaining live TA cell population in quadrant Q4 \\(scatter-plot statistics 85%) as shown in Figure-12b. Similarly small cell population can be sorted by PI vs. Hoechst Dye intensity plot determination. It segregates PI stained dead cells into quadrant Q1 &amp; Q2 \\(scatter-plot statistics 13%); Hoechst dye excluding live stem cells in quadrant Q3 \\(scatter-plot statistics 85%); and Hoechst dye retaining live TA cell population in quadrant Q4 \\(scatter-plot statistics 1%) as shown in \\(Figure-12c). A higher grade of separation can be achieved through this method. A better presentation of the data can be seen in Figure-13. The ample-pure stem cells thus isolated are ready for culture. As evident, EpSC yield is free from contaminant cells. The identification and isolation of a pure population of EpSC in literature has remained challenging for the fact that isolated putative stem cells in skin tissue can be at various developmental stages towards terminal differentiation.<br /> \r\n\n\nCell yield of the following order can be expected from various skin specimens; 3-5million cells/6d old mouse epidermis, &gt;50million fibroblasts/ 6d old neonate dermis, 1-2million cells/adult mouse skin. Greater number of stem cells is available in neonatal skin compared to adult tissue. In our protocol, the success rate and reproducibility has improved substantially by subjecting the putative stem cell-isolates to FACsaria and sub-culturing the identified LRCs as true stem cells.<br /> \r\n\n\nIsolation of stem cells following transplacental BrdU administration can also be demonstrated<sup>27</sup>. This novel protocol finds application in transplacental-toxicity \\(carcinogenesis) determination. In literature, a considerable number of toxicant viz. carcinogens/teratogens/ genotoxicants/tumor-initiators are described to be active transplacentally<sup>28-32</sup>. The involvement of stem cell as the target cell is suspected. Fetal stem cells are understood to be the key targets during transplacental chemical carcinogenesis. Our effort to isolate LRCs after transplacental administration of the toxicant together with BrdU-label provides novel opportunity to identify EpSC as target cell of the carcinogen and also to study the biochemical basis of transplacental-toxicity onset or its modulation. Vulnerability of tumor-initiated LRCs to tumor promotion by epigenetically active co-carcinogens can be studied using this protocol. Cutaneous-carcinogen-initiated stem cell can be identified and studied in detail for their contribution in transplacental carcinogenesis. Such studies can be conducted in EpSC to generate a database of altered gene-expression to gauge different grades of toxicants\u2019 exposure or biological effects \\(i.e. mild/moderate/ severe) and to elucidate the molecular basis for monitoring &amp; control. Resultant database can be validated in human for early detection of subjects at risk of exposure and the toxicity-onset."

Protocols available in literature do not conform to desired purity and better yield in short span of time, culture-condition for rapid growth, and characterization methods<sup>1-24</sup>. We report here the improved, albeit comprehensive and replicable protocols to identify, isolate, characterize, culture, cryo-preserve, subculture, and grow quickly a pure population of multipotent stem cell from mouse epidermis. Protocol has been validated using modified Growth Promoting Medium; FACS-based LRC-detection and verification; FACSaria based LRCs sorting to improve stem-cell yield and re-culture; immunohistochemical &amp; RT-PCR based verification of stem-cell biomarkers; low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> culture-conditions; FACS based revalidation and repeated characterization of passaged LRCs. Cryopreservation and re-culture displayed cultivability of pure population of stem cell. FACS-generated results demonstrate the attainment of purity to the order of &gt;90%. Key features of the present protocol are high yield of stem cell, rapid cell growth in 7d in contrast to 13-21d reported earlier, culture of pure population of stem cell as confirmed using FACS, and use of conditioned medium in place of feeder layer.",
