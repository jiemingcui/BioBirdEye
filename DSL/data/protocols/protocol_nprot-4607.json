            "content": "Taxol is an important anticancer drug. It is a plant derived compound and being used for the treatment of breast, ovary and many other cancers. In cells, taxol fixes the microtubules and prevents its depolymerization, leading to stop the cell cycle and leading to the death of cells1. There are numerous approaches to produce taxol  such as semi synthesis3, chemical synthesis4-7, fungal biosynthesis8-10, and plan cell culture technology11. Taxol is a diterpene amide and its isolation from natural sources is impractical since it gives low yields and leads to extinction of Taxus species 12,13. Production of taxol through semi synthesis is performed by employing 10-deacetylbaccatin III \\(10-DABIII)14from the needles of wild or cultivated T. baccata \\(European yew) and T. yunnanensis \\(Himalayan yew)15.This procedure is less destructive as compared to  extraction of Taxol from the bark of T. brevifolia16. The chemical synthesis is another way to produce taxol as non-dependent on natural resources. The high cost for its achievement5,17, the lower yield, limit the production of taxol by this method18 are the draw backs. Production of taxol by microbial fermentation can be another approach to obtain this medicinally and commercially important drug. It is produced by many genera of fungi isolated from yew trees 19-24. But fungi produce taxol in low quantity. Research is in progress to increase the yield of taxol by fungal fermentation, unfourtunately, the results are very poor so far. This is could be due to reaction between fungi and higher level of taxol which prevents fungal growth and development25. Undeniably, none of these fungi have successfully produced high amount of taxol. Thus, plant cell cultures represent an alternative, environmentally sustainable source of taxol production that can provide a stable supply of taxol for commercial production .Due to above advantages, numerous investigations on the production of taxol and related compound are being conducted through cell suspended culture by using several Taxus specious26-31. In this study attempts are made to use pegylated nano niosme as a carrier of plant hormone in cell culture of Taxus species. This technology led to supply the essential hormones whenever it was required for improving and growing the plant tissues and therefore causing an increase in taxol production in short period of time."

The obtained cells were suspended in extracting buffer which were subjected to homogenization using mortar and pestle. The obtained suspension was centrifuged and the clear supernatant was passed through 0.22 \u03bcm filter paper. The clear solution containing taxol was subjected to HPLC analysis in order to estimate the amount of taxol produced by Taxus species in media with pegylated nano niosomal 2,4-D and devoid of pegylated nano niosomal 2,4-D\\(Fig. 4).The commercial taxol was used as an standard. As it is depicted from Fig.4, the amount of Taxol produced in medium containing pegylated nano niosomal 2, 4-D is higher than that produced in medium containing free 2,4-D.The higher production of taxol by incorporation of pegylated nano niosomal 2, 4-D into the culture medium could be due to slow release of 2,4 D into the medium as compared to free 2,4-D."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Nowadays, studies about yew tree as a main source of taxol \\(anticancer drugs)  is being expanded rapidly. In the last few years, taxol is being isolated from the bark of Taxus brevifolia as the species of yew tree, containing very low amount \\( approximately 0.01% ) .Taxol is diterpenoid amide and can be produced by different approaches, suspended cell culture is a method through which taxol can be produced  . In this study, 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid\\(2,4-D) was nano niosomated in order to deliver the plant hormone to the cells under cultivation. The result demonstrated that the amount of taxol was significantly increased when the cell culture was exposed to pegylated nano niosomal 2 , 4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid\\(2,4-D)  .",
