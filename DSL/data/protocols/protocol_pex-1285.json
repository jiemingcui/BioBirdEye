            "content": "<p>\tGlycans are abundantly present in tissues and blood circulation in the form of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Glycome is estimated to be 10<sup>4</sup> times larger than the proteome[1-4]. Glycan biosynthesis has no templates and its structures are influenced by genes, nutrition, and other environmental factors in time and space[5]. Over 125 congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) discovered in humans are associated with multi-systems disfunctions [6]. It has been well documented that total serum <em>O-</em> or <em>N-</em>glycans are different among healthy individuals and patients suffering different type of cancers [7-10]. Thus, abnormal glycan structures are common features for both inherited and environment-related diseases. </p><p>\tIndeed, most clinically used cancer biomarkers established during the past 40 years are either specific glycan structures or glycoproteins [11, 12]. However, these clinically used cancer biomarkers have low sensitivity and specificity as biomarkers [13] due to limited glycan information content [11]. In contrast, current glycomics approaches depend on profiling complicated glycan structures, which are technically difficult for clinical applications [14, 15]. </p><p>\tDespite there are many different types of glycans [11], all human glycans consist of up to 10 monosaccharides, i.e. sialic acid, N-acetyl galactosamine, N-acetyl glucosamine, galactose, mannose, fucose, glucose, xylose, glucuronic acid, and iduronic acid. However, few methods have been developed to quantify glycan contents or monosaccharide compositions in human sera or plasmas for biomarker development.</p><p>\tThis protocol was originally developed from the corresponding author\u2019s laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis for glucosamine- and galactosamine-based, serum- or animal tissue-derived glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification purposes [16-20]. We then discovered that significantly different quantity and compositions of glucosamine and galactosamine are present in the plasmas of human patients suffering lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers, respectively, [17, 21]. Since the major glycans in human sera/plasmas are N-linked and O-linked glycans instead of GAGs, we subsequently developed a HPLC method that can quantify all other monosaccharides in addition to glucosamine and galactosamine released from serum/plasma glycans simultaneously[22-25] for biomarker development. </p><p>\tReleasing monosaccharides from glycans is the bottleneck of monosaccharide composition analysis[26, 27]. The conventional hydrolysis assay for releasing monosaccharides from glycans of either plant or animal origin is conducted in a sealed glass ampoule at 105\u2013120 \u25e6C for 1\u20136 h [27, 28] or in a PicoTag station[17]. Thus, we have optimized the ampule-sealed acidolysis assay for human serum or plasma analysis. The monosaccharide compositions are then obtained by PMP-labeling and HPLC analysis.&nbsp;</p>"

Storage: each serum sample was divided into 3 aliquots in 1.5 mL EP tubes and store at -80\u2103. Serum can be stored at -80\u2103 for more than one year without affecting monosaccharide compositions.\nAcidolysis. TIMING 24 h for up to 72 samples\n4. Serum samples are thawed on ice and 10 \u03bcL serum sample is transferred into 2 mL ampoule.\n5. Add 10 \u03bcL Rha (1 mg/mL) and 1 mL TFA (2M) into each ampoule.\n6. Use Oil bath to conduct acidolysis, which takes 6 h. Transfer the sample to 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and dry it in centrifugal concentrator\n\u00b7\nProblem:\nExtra residues in hydrolyzed serum samples.\n\u00b7\nSolution:\nAdd 200 \u03bcL of chromatographic methanol and then vortex. After fully mixed, concentrate and dry, repeat three times to obtain the cleaner hydrolyzed samples.\nSample derivatization. TIMING 90 min for up to 72 samples\n7. Add 40 \u03bcL NaOH (0.3M) and 60 \u03bcL PMP (0.5M) into each sample. Vortex for 5 s and centrifuge for another 10 s.\nCRITICAL STEP\nAt this point, the 0.3M NaOH offer the basic environment required for PMP derivation. The proper derivative pH is between 11-13.\n\u00b7\nProblem:\nPMP-derivatives show brown color.\n\u00b7\nSolution:\nThe preparation of 0.3 M NaOH should be careful. Excessive alkali produces the colored byproducts.\n8. PMP derivatization reaction is conducted at 70\u2103 in a water bath for 90 minutes, then neutralize with hydrochloric acid.\nCRITICAL STEP\nIn alkaline conditions, non-reactive PMP will exist in the form of salt in the system, which will reduce the efficiency of subsequent extraction, and lead to an increasing background for HPLC analysis.\n9. Add 500 \u03bcL CHCl\n3\ninto each sample tube, and vortex for 5 s.\n10. Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 g/min and transfer the supernatant to HPLC vials.\nPAUSE POINT\nThe PMP-labeled monosaccharides can be stored at 4 \u2103 and analyzed within 3 days.\nMonosaccharide standard derivatization.\n11. Preparation of monosaccharide standards: Firstly, dilute the stock solution of Man\uff0cGlcN\uff0cGalN\uff0cGlcUA\uff0cGlc\uff0cGal\uff0c Xyl\uff0cFuc, Rha to 1.0 mg/mL. Then mix the 9 monosaccharide standards together and dilute 2 times. The final range of working standard solution is 0.5 mg/mL to 0.0005 mg/mL.\n12. Add 40 \u03bcL 0.3 M NaOH into each standard mixture to adjust pH to 12-13, and add 60 \u03bcL 0.5 M PMP for monosaccharide labeling as described in Steps 7 to 10.\nHPLC analysis. TIMING~20 min per sample\n13. Tuning of the LC system. Assure that the LC is working appropriately according to the manufacturers\u2019 recommendations or the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the respective laboratory.\n14. Set up the HPLC system to separate PMP-labeled monosaccharides as described under\nEQUIPMENT SETUP\n.\n\u00b7\nProblem:\nHigh background; No signal; Weak signal or impurity peaks.\n\u00b7\nSolution:\nThe extraction conditions described in Steps 9-10 need to be followed, a high background is usually caused by leftover PMP in samples; ensure that the LC-MS system is working properly and the wavelength of DAD is set at 254 nm; Check pH value of Step 7. The efficiency of the PMP-derivatization will be decreased if the pH is lower than 11 or higher than 13.\nCharacterization of glycan monosaccharide compositions in serum samples. TIMING\nIt takes\n55 min\nper sample. Up to 26 samples can be analyzed by one HPLC instrument in 24 h.\n15. Calculating monosaccharide contents is based on the regression equation of the monosaccharide standards.\n16. Statistical analysis of serum glycan monosaccharide compositions in specific disease."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>\tThis protocol describes the procedures where an ampule-sealed acidolysis is used for releasing glycan monosaccharides from serum or plasma samples. The monosaccharide composition analysis is subsequently obtained by a traditional HPLC method that separates and quantifies all 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP)-labeled monosaccharides in 10 \u03bcl serum in 55 minutes. The described workflow takes approximately 2 days, up to 26 serum samples can be analyzed with one HPLC instrument per day. Each step of the experimental procedures has been optimized with repeated tests of monosaccharide standards and serum samples.&nbsp;</p>",
