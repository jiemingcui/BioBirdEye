            "content": "Other assay methods for this type of enzyme analyse ATPase activity but assessment of the effects on the helicase unwinding activity is considered the method of choice forevaluating inhibitors of this class of enzyme \\(1).  Helicase activity assays rely on the ability of the enzyme to displace one strand \\(release strand) of DNA or RNA from another \\(template) strand. Many reports use displacement of radio-labelled release strands, detected either after gel electrophoresis \\(2), thin layer chromatography \\(3) or scintillation counting \\(4).  The latter method may be amenable to high-throughput screening but carries the practical disadvantages of the use of radioactive materials. Further methods have incorporated DIG labelled release strands to allow detection by ELISA \\(5). We propose a new combined method that uses chemiluminescent antibody detection of the residual release strand to give a robust helicase assay, that does not employ radiolabelled compounds and gives a stable read-out that is well suited to high-throughput screening.\r\n\n\n As proof of concept, the HCV helicase was expressed and isolated using recombinant protein techniques and then used in our assay. We found this assay to be highly reproducible since only slight variation was observed when a total of 96 helicase reactions \\(including controls) were performed on a single plate. Therefore, our suggested rapid helicase assay is fast, convenient and highly reproducible while obviating the need to employ radiochemicals. These criteria make it suitable for high throughput screening of potential helicase inhibitors."

For negative controls, the reaction mix is lacking ATP. Reactions should be carried out for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. Wells should then be washed twice with 200 \u03bcl of 150 mM NaCl and dried at room temperature for 15 min. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6) Activity determination \u2013 chemiluminescence preparation\r\n\n\nThe wells of the multi-well plate are washed for 5 min with detection washing buffer \\(0.1 M maleic acid, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.3%, Tween20, pH 7.5). Then each well is filled up with blocking solution \\(10% BSA \\(w/v) 0.1 M maleic acid, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min followed by a 30 min incubation in 20 \u03bcl Antibody solution \\(anti-Dig, Roche, 1:10,000 solution of the antibody -75 mU/ml- in Blocking solution). The wells are washed twice with 100 \u03bcl of detection buffer \\(0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 9.5). Then 20 \u03bcl of detection buffer is applied for equilibration. 1 \u03bcl of chemiluminescence substrate \\(CSPD \u2013 0.25 mM) working solution is applied to each well and the plates are incubated for 5 min at 17oC. The wells are then drained and incubated at 37oC for 30 min to allow for any remaining solution to evaporate. The luminescence continues for approximately 48 hours with a constant-intensity phase lasting  24 hours. The remaining DIG label in each well of the 96 well-plate is counted for 10 min against controls \\(one of which lacks  protein and the other lacks ATP) in a luminescence multi-well plate reader.\r\n\n\n^ Critical step\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEPS:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Choice of oligonucleotides.  The oligonucleotides used in this protocol are those described by Hicham Alaoui-Ismaili et al. \\(4), modified by DIG labelling of the release strand.  Other sequences are possible but a 3\u2019 single stranded region in the substrate appears to be required to initiate strand displacement \\(6).\r\n\n\nStep 3: During the blocking step it is important to ensure that all potential binding sites are occupied, to prevent direct binding of the detection antibody to the well in step 6.  The wells should be filled with blocking solution to achieve full coating of the plate.\r\n\n\nStep 4: Pre-warming the solutions allows reactions to proceed at their optimum temperatures and avoids rate changes due to temperature equilibration.\r\n\n\nStep 6: Reaction wells should be completely filled up with blocking solution in order to ensure that the whole well has been blocked, thus preventing non-specific binding of any components of the detection system."

            "content": "PROOF OF PRINCIPLE:\r\n\n\nExpression, purification and biochemical characterization of HCV helicase activity. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe full-length HCV helicase coding region was incorporated into the pET28a vector \\(Novagen, Madison, WI, USA), carrying an N\u2019 terminal 6xHis-Tag region. The nucleotide sequence was veri\ufb01ed prior to protein production. The HCV helicase gene was generously provided by Dr K. Klump, Roche laboratories in Palo Alto, USA.  \r\n\n\nThe helicase plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain C41 \\(DE3 \u2013 plysS, Novagen). Cultures were grown in 750 ml LB medium, containing chloramphenicol 34 \u03bcg/ml and kanamycin 25 \u03bcg/ml. Protein production was induced at an attenuance \\(600 nm) of 0.45 with 0.5 mM IPTG. The culture was allowed to grow for 3 hours at 18oC following induction.  The cell pellet from 4 x 750 ml cultures was resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, before the addition of lysozyme to 100 \u03bcg/ml and Triton X-100 to a \ufb01nal concentration of 0.1%.  Following a 30 min incubation on ice, the suspension was sonicated four times for 20 s with 15 s intervals \\(Branson soni\ufb01er). Then it was centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min. Clari\ufb01ed homogenates were adjusted to 10 mM imidazole \\(Sigma), \ufb01ltered through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane and loaded twice on a nickel af\ufb01nity column. After washing the column with \ufb01ve column volumes of buffer S \\(20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl) containing 10 mM imidazole, NS3 was eluted with buffer S containing 300 mM imidazole.  To avoid precipitation, immediately after elution, the buffer in the helicase-containing fractions was exchanged for 25 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.5, 0.05% CHAPS \\(3-\\[\\(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulphonate), 20% glycerol, 5 mM DTT \\(dithiothreitol). Buffer exchange was performed by dialysis. Protein concentration was evaluated using the Bradford protein assay \\(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) with bovine serum albumin \\(BSA) as standard. \r\n\n\nPuri\ufb01ed NS3 protein was aliquoted and stored at  80\u00b0C.  This protein preparation was estimated to be greater than 85% pure by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining. The puri\ufb01cation procedure yields approximately 1.6 mg of HCV NS3 per 3 litres of E. coli cultures \\(figure 1). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2049/original/1.png?1324558169\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2049/thumbnail/1.png?1324558169\" > </a>\r\n\n\nFigure 1. The SDS \\(left) and western blot \\(right, anti-His-tag antibody, qiagen penta-His conjugated) for the HCV helicase protein.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nChemiluminesence readings were taken using all different control combinations \\(presence/absence of helicase, DNA substrate and ATP) of the experiment in order to ensure the reliability of the measurements \\(table 1). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2050/original/2.png?1324558192\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2050/thumbnail/2.png?1324558192\" > </a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIt was demonstrated that the NS3-mediated unwinding is proportional to both the amount of DNA substrate in the well, and to the HCV helicase concentration in the reaction. As expected the reactions were ATP-dependent \\(table 2 and Figure 2). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2051/original/3.png?1324558217\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2051/thumbnail/3.png?1324558217\" > </a>\r\n\n\nFigure 2.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "A new assay for the measurement of helicase enzyme activity was developed for the evaluation of the potency of potential inhibitors. This assay involves the use of a DNA or RNA duplex substrate and recombinant purified helicase. The DNA duplex consists of a pair of oligonucleotides, one of which is biotinylated and the other is digoxygenin \\(DIG)-labelled, both at their respective 5\u2019 termini. This DNA duplex  is immobilised, via the biotin molecule, on the surface of a neutravidin-coated 96 well plate. Helicase activity results in DNA unwinding upon activation  by ATP, leading to the release of the DIG labelled oligonucleotides, which translates in signal \\(luminescence) reduction with respect to control wells. This signal can be produced and quantified with the aid of a chemiluminescence antibody.",
