Lymphatic vessels within the meninges have been shown to support the drainage of macromolecules and solutes [<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR1\" target=\"_blank\">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR2\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR3\" target=\"_blank\">3</a>]. Studying their functions that may govern inflammatory processes and immune surveillance of the meninges and CNS poses a valuable contribution to our understanding of neurological disease, and even resistance to therapies of the CNS [<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR4\" target=\"_blank\">4</a>]. Recent studies from our laboratory indicated that the meningeal environment is changed following performance of cognitive tasks [<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR5\" target=\"_blank\">5</a>]. T cells are recruited to the meningeal spaces, supporting neuronal function through production of IL-4 and regulating meningeal myeloid cell phenotypes and subsequent brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Thus, investigating the migration in and out of the meninges of different cell types through lymphatic vessels is critical for further understanding the crosstalk between immune system and nervous system. The use of single cell analysis such as flow cytometry or RNA-seq allows phenotypic and even functional characterization of the lymphatic cells, aiming at deciphering their role in guiding immune sentinels. Such fundamental features as morphology, surface phenotype, and function are unreported in neurological diseases. Here we provide simple methods to extract and analyze lymphatic endothelial cells from the meninges to effectively identify their contribution to physiological processes in health and disease. These techniques could also be used to address this and many other outstanding questions pertaining human meningeal lymphatics biology.</p>"

Anesthetize mouse by injection of a suitable dosage of anesthesia [\n6\n] in accordance with the regulations of your institution\u2019s animal care and use committee.\n2. Make an incision through the abdominal wall of the chest, cut both sides of the rib cage to expose the heart and clip the right auricle with a small scissor.\n3. Perfuse the mouse through the left ventricle with ~15 ml of ice-cold PBS with 5\u00a0U/ml heparin at a rate of ~10 ml per minute until the liver is clear of blood.\n4. Replace the PBS-containing syringe with the PFA-containing syringe and perfuse manually with ~15 ml of 4% PFA at a rate of ~10\u00a0ml/min (\nNote:\nTwitching and stiffing of the muscles indicate successful perfusion of the fixative.).\n5. Remove the skin from the back and head of the dorsal site of the mouse with a pair of blunt scissors.\n6. Decapitate mouse close to the skull, approximately at C1 level. Make a transverse cut through the L5 vertebrae, just above the hips.\n7. Continue with a longitudinal incision from the anterior end, down the right side of the spinal cord until reaching the cervical region. Repeat longitudinal cut along the left side of the spinal cord. Lift the column and separate it from muscles, organs and connective tissue underneath.\n8. Keep the skull and spinal cord in 4% PFA at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h (\nNote:\nOver fixation for 2\u20133\u00a0days may cause some antigens to be masked and not be recognized by specific antibodies. The tissue should be stored in PBS supplemented with 0.01% sodium azide or 0.02% thimerosal\u00a0at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for up to a year. If fluorescent proteins are used, tissue should be protected from light to avoid photobleaching.).\nSpinal Cord Meninges Whole-Mount Preparation\n1. Fill a petri dish with PBS and place the spinal cord with the ventral site up. Take angled spring scissors and clip the neural arch bilaterally one to two segments at a time. Then lift the end of the lose bone and cut across the neural spine to remove the bone and expose the ventral surface of the spinal cord. Continue this process with the next vertebrae until the whole ventral surface of the spinal cord is exposed.\n2. To widen the spinal column for dissection, hold the edges of the spinal column on either side with two straight forceps and crack open carefully.\n3. Remove spinal cord and adherent meninges in one piece and place in petri dish with fresh PBS (\nNote:\nOptional: dorsal root ganglions can be carefully pulled out of bone segments before the spinal cord is resected.).\n4. Use spring microscissors to make a midline incision of the meninges along the ventral surface of the spinal cord.\n5. Remove meninges and place in 24-well plate with 1 ml PBS.\nDural Brain Meninges Whole Mount Preparation\n1.Remove muscles caudal of the skull and use fine angled scissors to make two incisions: (1) cut the skull starting at the brainstem and go counterclockwise toward the olfactory bulb. (2) Make a second incision in clockwise direction on the left side of the head until the rostral part is reached on both sides. Stay above the mandible muscles.\n2. Use forceps to pick up the bone at the inferior end and bend it over, taking care not to damage the attached dura mater.\n3. Place the skullcap in 24-well plate with 1 ml of 4% PFA and incubate at least 2\u00a0h at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\n4. Wash once with 1 ml PBS. Carefully remove meninges (dura and some arachnoid) from interior part of the skull cap with fine forceps under a dissecting scope. It is easiest to start at the top of the skull and pull the meninges down in the middle part, and then remove the sides. Move along the edge and peal the meninges from each site and collect it by the pineal gland. If done correctly, the whole meninges can be scoped up in on piece (\nNote:\nBe careful to not tear the meninges and only touch the edges to collect the meninges in the center of the skullcap.).\n5. Place dissected meninges in 1 ml of PBS in a 24-well plate.\nImmunohisto-chemistry and Imaging Meninges\n1. Wash tissue once in 0.5 ml PBS and incubate in 0.3 ml blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at room temperature (\nNote:\nThe volume used should be just enough to cover the entire tissue. In general, we recommend all steps to be performed on an orbital shaker (with slow agitation). The serum used for blocking depends on the species the secondary antibody was raised in. If the target antigen is intracellular, it is important to permeabilize with Triton X-100 to improve the penetration of antibodies.).\n2. Immunostain the meninges with 0.3 ml primary antibody, such as VEGFR-3, Lyve-1 and podoplanin (at a concentration of 1:100, 1:400, and 1:100) in PBST overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C (\nNote:\nLonger incubation periods do not enhance the staining signal significantly. We routinely use directly conjugated antibodies for multicolor staining if clones were generated in the same animal species and have corresponding secondary antibodies.).\n3. Decant the solution and wash with 0.5 ml PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat two times with fresh PBS.\n4. Incubate the tissue with 0.3 ml secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescent protein (at a concentration of 1\u20132\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) in PBST with 1% BSA for 1\u00a0h at room temperature in the dark.\n5. Decant the secondary antibody solution and wash once with PBS and incubate in 0.3 ml Hoechst or DAPI (at a concentration of 0.1\u20131\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in PBS) for 3 min at room temperature in the dark.\n6. Rinse twice with 0.5 ml PBS.\n7. Transfer meninges with paintbrushes to a glass slide with a few drops of PBS. Unfold them carefully and aspirate PBS to flatten meninges and let them dry. Cover with mounting medium to preserve fluorescence and seal with a nail polish to prevent movement (\nNote:\nAvoid any bubbles to not affect the preservation of the tissue and quality of the image.).\n8. The tissue is now ready for imaging by using a conventional widefield microscope, confocal microscope, or an ultramicroscope (\nNote:\nDepending on the mounting medium, slides can be stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C or \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C in the dark for weeks or month.). (See Fig. 1)\nOpen image in new window\nFig. 1 Immunohistochemical detection of CNS-associated lymphatics .

(b) Immunostaining of a Prox-1 tdTomato reporter animal with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg anti-Lyve1 eFluor660\nSorting of Meningeal Lymphatic Endothelial Cells\nMeningeal Single Cell Suspension\n1. Transfer meninges from brain (or spinal cord) into 2 ml tube with 0.5 ml RPMI (\nNote:\nIn the case that the extracted cells are to be cultured, all procedures should be performed in a laminar flow hood and proper aseptic techniques applied.).\n2. Add 0.5 ml 2\u00d7 enzymatic cocktail and place tube in 37\u00a0\u00b0C incubator on a rotating mixer for 15 min.\n3. Filter the resulting single-cell suspension through a 70\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer into a 50 ml tube. Add 20 ml of ice-cold PBS to wash the strainer.\n4. Centrifuge cells for 10 min at 320\u00a0\u00d7\ng\nat 4\u00a0\u00b0C and discard\u00a0the supernatant\n5. Resuspend each pellet in 200\u00a0\u03bcl ice-cold sorting buffer and count total number using an automated cell counter or hemacytometer\u00a0(\nNote:\nWe mix 10\u00a0\u03bcl of the cell suspension with 10\u00a0\u03bcl of Acridine orange/Propidium iodine solution and count with an automated Cellometer Auto 2000 cell counter. Obtaining cell viability and total counts can also be quickly performed with a hemocytometer and 0.4% Trypan Blue Solution.).\nStaining of Meningeal Lymphatic Endothelial Cells\n1. Place cells in 96-V well plate and centrifuge for 5 min at 320\u00a0\u00d7\ng\nand 4\u00a0\u00b0C (\nNote:\nThe total number of meningeal cells per animal will be <1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/ml so the entire pellet is used.).\n2. Add 100\u00a0\u03bcl primary antibody cocktail and resuspend with pipette. Incubate for 30 min on ice.\n3. Add 10\u00a0\u03bcl of DAPI (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and incubate for 5 min on ice.\n4. Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, discard supernatant and wash with 100\u00a0\u03bcl sorting buffer.\n5. Repeat\u00a0step 4\u00a0and keep cell samples on ice until they are ready for sorting (or analyzing) on a flow cytometer (\nNote:\nIt is recommended to acquire fresh samples and not store them for more than 2\u00a0h. Also, prepare one tube of negative control (unstained cells or calibration beads) and single cell stained cells for relevant compensation controls.). (See Fig. 2)\nOpen image in new window\nFig. 2 Flow cytometry analysis of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) within the brain meninges. Cells obtained were immunostained with antibodies against CD31, podoplanin (for endothelial cells), CD45 (hematopoietic), and DAPI (DNA stain). Typical flow-cytometric profile of LEC (CD45\u2212 podoplanin+ CD31+) freshly isolated from the meninges of an individual mouse\nQuantification of CSF Drainage to Cervical Lymph Nodes\nCisterna Magna Injection of Tracers\n1. Mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 100\u00a0mg/kg Ketamine and 10\u00a0mg/kg Xylazine (\nNote:\nThe body temperature is maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and eye lubricant used to prevent drying.).\n2. The neck is shaved, the mouse placed on a stereotaxic frame and the head secured with tooth and ear bars.\n3. The surgical site is swabbed with 10% iodine, followed by 70% ethanol, and a 1 cm sagittal incision of the skin over the occipital bone and cervical spinal cord is made.\n4. Under the dissection microscope, the covering muscle layers are separated by blunt dissection with forceps and a pair of retractors used to hold the muscles apart.\n5. The mouse\u2019s body is lowered by ~1 cm so that the head forms a 140\u00b0 angle (\nNote:\nIt is important to position the head and body of the mouse properly on the stereotaxic instrument so that the cisterna magna is exposed.).\n6. The posterior atlantooccipital membrane is exposed and penetrated with a Hamilton syringe equipped with a bevel ended 33-G needle (\nNote:\nAvoid blood vessels to prevent bleeding.).\n7. A volume of 2\u00a0\u03bcl of tracer, such as fluorescent ovalbumin, is diluted in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (\nsee\nNote\n4\n) and slowly infused intra cisternally. The needle is held in place for ~2 min to prevent leakage of the tracer and slowly removed while observing if any backflow occurs.\n8. After injection, the retractors are removed and the skin sutured. The mouse is monitored until its recovery.\nPreparation and Staining of Cervical Lymph\u00a0Nodes\n1. Two hours after tracer injection, mice are perfused with cold saline, followed by 4% PFA. CSF-draining lymph nodes (deep and superficial cervical) present in both sides of the neck and nondraining lymph nodes (peritoneal or inguinal) are harvested into 4% PFA (\nNote:\nIt is important to keep track of the exact time of injection to minimize variability. A 2-h time point is indicated to measure drainage into deep cervical lymph nodes.).\n2. Tissue is washed with PBS and lymph nodes placed in 30% sucrose overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C or until sunk to the bottom of the tube.\n3. Lymph nodes are placed in a mold with OCT and frozen on dry ice.\n4. 30\u00a0\u03bcm sections are cut on a cryostat and collected onto gelatin-coated glass slides. In order to get a representation of the entire lymph node at least ten sections of each lymph node should be collected (\nNote:\nSections can be stored for up to 1\u00a0month at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C.).\n5. Draw a border around the sectioned tissue with a hydrophobic pen and let air-dry for a few minutes at room temperature.\n6. Rinse in PBS and then wash with PBST for 3 min (in a glass staining jar) at room temperature to remove residues of OCT.\n7. Incubate with 200\u2013250\u00a0\u03bcl (depending on the slide area containing tissue sections) of blocking solution in PBST for 20 min at room temperature in a humidifying chamber, then wash once with PBST for 3 min at room temperature.\n8. Add 200\u2013250\u00a0\u03bcl antibody cocktail in PBST with 0.5% BSA and incubate for 1\u00a0h at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidifying chamber.\n9. Wash with PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat wash step twice.\n10. Add 200\u2013250\u00a0\u03bcl of secondary antibody mix in PBST with 1% BSA for 1\u00a0h at room temperature in a humidifying chamber.\n11. Wash once with PBS for 5 min at room temperature.\n12. Add 200\u2013250\u00a0\u03bcl DAPI or Hoechst solution and incubate for 5 min at room temperature in a humidifying chamber.\n13. Wash twice with PBS for 5 min at room temperature.\n14. Let slides air-dry, then add mounting medium plus glass coverslip and seal with nail polish.\n15. Tissue is now ready to be imaged with a microscope. Tracer are being quantified by total counts (micrometer-sized FluoSpheres) and/or area covered (by peptides or other smaller tracers) in draining versus nondraining lymph nodes. (See Fig. 3)\nOpen image in new window\nFig. 3 Quantification of drainage from the CSF to cervical lymph nodes. (a) Shown is a confocal image of a 30\u00a0\u03bcm section of a deep cervical lymph node. Two hours post injection of fluorescently labeled ovalbumin into the cisterna magna, all nodes were collected, sliced and immunostained for imaging.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>The study of meningeal lymphatic vessels of the central nervous system (CNS) has recently gathered momentum, with several papers dissecting their role in draining solutes from cerebrospinal fluid and brain (Louveau et al., Nature 523(7560):337\u2013341, 2015; Antila et al., J Exp Med 214(12):3645\u20133667, 2017; Aspelund et al., J Exp Med 212(7):991\u2013999, 2015). Methodological capabilities, however, have been limited to few laboratories due to difficulties reproducibly visualizing these rare cell subsets in the meninges. To explore meningeal lymphatics fundamental role during homeostasis and how they may contribute to human pathology, the field has begun to require purification and characterization of lymphatic endothelial cells. Here, modern cell biological techniques involving a combination of histological, flow-cytometric, and functional drainage assays are applied to brain and spinal cord meninges and detailed stepwise procedures used for successful in vivo and ex vivo characterization of meningeal lymphatic vessels.</p>",
