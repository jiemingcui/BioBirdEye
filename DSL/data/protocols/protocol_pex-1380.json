Apical secretions (mucin) may also be observed.\u00a0Cells have usually achieved uniform differentiation by day 24; this is the standard point to begin exposing cells to desired pollutants or treatments.\nThe lifetime of the culture will vary with the cell donors.\u00a0Other factors will also influence the length of time you are able to maintain the differentiated culture.\u00a0These include the age of the ALI medium, the freshness of the RE solution, the gentleness with which you have handled the inserts during rinsing, etc.\nQuality control rationale\nThe health of the cells can be determined visually using an inverted microscope.\u00a0Cultures showing signs of bacterial or fungal contamination should be immediately removed from use and disposed of properly.\u00a0Cells are maintained in a water-jacketed CO\n2\nincubator; the concentration of CO\n2\nshould be checked periodically (at least once per week) using a Fyrite test kit.\u00a0The temperature within the chambers should also be monitored with a thermometer.\u00a0Incubators are periodically (at least every two weeks) cleaned with anti-bacterial/antifungal agents.\u00a0An antifungal agent (benzalkonium chloride) is added to the internal water trays to deter growth of contaminants."
