            "content": "Given that DNA on which genomic information is written exists as chromosomes in a cell, handling chromosomes in vitro as experimental materials can provide varieties of information throughout life sciences. Metaphase chromosomes are highly delicate under in vitro conditions, moreover, it has been difficult to prepare massive chromosomes as experimental materials. These inconvenient points have prevented researchers to use chromosomes as the materials for in vitro experiments, although numerous microscopic observations have been so far performed. There is a standard protocol to prepare mitotic metaphase chromosomes, i.e., PA method<sup>1, 2, 5-7</sup>. However the chromosomes prepared by the method have been found to contain lots of contaminated proteins<sup>4</sup>. Ordinary purification processes, i.e., the sucrose density gradient centrifugation<sup>4</sup> often or usually result in tremendous decrease in chromosome yield. Thus the purity and the quantity have never met in chromosome sample preparation. Recently we have developed a new method based on several previously published protocols<sup>1-4</sup>. The method enables obtainment of intact and highly purified chromosomes in large quantities.  The protocol consists of two steps; isolation of chromosomes from the synchronized mitotic human cells by the improved PA procedure, and purification of the chromosomes by Percoll density gradient centrifugation \\(PDGC)."

Usually the cells are cultured of 4 l in total using ten flasks \\(400 ml per flask).\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Add the colcemid solution \\(final concentration of 0.1 ug/ml) to the culture at cell densities of 3-4\u00d710\n5\n/ml. Incubate the culture for another 16 h before harvesting.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Isolation of metaphase chromosomes from HeLa S3 cells TIMING: 2.5-3.5 h**\r\n\n\n3.

Usually cells harvested from 2 l of culture are suspended in 50 ml of the hypotinic solution in one 50 ml tube. Stand the tube\\(s) at R.T. for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 780 \u00d7g and at 4 \u00b0C for 10 minutes in a TS-38N rotor.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Remove supernatant by decantation and add 40 ml of ice-cold PA buffer per one tube. Cells should be resuspended well by tapping tube with fingers.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Take 40 ml of the solution, and disrupt cell membrane with a Dounce homogenizer \\(about 20 times). Repeat the same for another 40 ml.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. Mix and stir gently the solution and add PA buffer up to 90 ml and transfer the solution of 15 ml into six 50 ml tubes.

Mixture of the solution recovered at step 9 are gently laid onto four 50 ml tubes of 10 ml PA storage buffer, followed by centrifugation at 1,750 \u00d7g and for 20 minutes in a TS-38N rotor.

For example, it enables us to investigate the effect of different factors on chromosome morphology by exchanging buffer solutions without any interference of cytoplasmic elements. Morphological changes of the isolated chromosomes caused by increased salt concentration are clearly detected by scanning electron microscopy \\(SEM) as shown in Fig. 1. This method is also essential for researchers to perform biochemical experiments targeting chromosomes, such as proteome analysis of human chromosomes, which require intact and sufficient materials in amount. A few hundred micrograms of chromosomal proteins can be obtained at one preparation. We have already succeeded in producing the varieties of antibodies against chromosomal proteins by immunization of the proteins prepared from the isolated chromosomes to mice8, where the purified chromosomes and proteins extracted from them are essential source as the antigens. As depicted in Fig. 2, several proteins detected in PA chromosomes were removed in PG chromosomes maintaining the proteins characteristic to the chromosome higher order structure, such as topoisomerase I \\(topo I) and IIa \\(topo IIa), condensin subunits \\(closed triangle), and histones. They were retained at the similar levels between PA and PG chromosomes. About 200 ug of chromosomal proteins are obtained from 1 l of cell culture \\(~2.8&#xD7;108 cells). Furthermore indirect immunofluorescent staining using the PG chromosomes10 provides much clearer localization signal of proteins on chromosomes without any interference by cytoplasm as demonstrated in Fig. 3. Both the chromosomal proteins of topoisomerase IIa&#xF020;and Ki-67 were clearly detected at chromosome axial regions and chromatid peripheral regions, respectively. Thus, the PG chromosomes obtained by the protocol described here ensure the quality of the results not only in biological observation but also biochemical handling and experiments"
