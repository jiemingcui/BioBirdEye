            "header": "Introduction",
            "content": "<p>Endodontically treated teeth usually present with some challenges, such as insufficient tooth structure due to caries, trauma and endodontic access, loss of vitality resulting in more fracture susceptibility. This indicate the need of intra-radicular retentive strategies to allow the restoration&nbsp;to&nbsp;withstand the functional forces as well as restore the required esthetics<sup>1</sup>. Accordingly, post systems with different designs and materials have been developed to retain the coronal definitive restoration and reduce the amount of stress transferred to the tooth structure<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiber reinforced posts (FRP) accompanied with resin cements have been developed as a substitute to metal posts. Their main advantage is the near similarity of their mechanical and optical &nbsp;properties to those of dentine, leading to a balanced stress distribution pattern and decrease the susceptibility of vertical root fracture<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resin cements have been used to provide chemical and micromechanical bonding interfaces between fiber post and the root dentin <sup>4</sup>. With the continuous improvements of resin cements, self-adhesive type&nbsp;is preferred since it offers a simpler bonding technique<sup>1</sup>. Self-adhesive cements act both micromechanically and chemically on the interactions between monomeric acidic group and hydroxyapatite<sup>4</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different post space treatment strategies have been investigated to achieve better resin-dentin adhesion. They aim mainly to remove the amorphous smear layer that was formed during post space preparation allowing better penetration of cement within dentinal tubules<sup>5</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrigation with ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) followed by sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) has proven to adequately remove the smear layer. Unfortunately, using these solutions alternatively alters the Calcium:Phosphate (Ca:P) ratio by removing calcium ions from hydroxyapatite crystals in dentin at approximate depths of 20-30\u00b5m<sup>6</sup>. This change in ratio affects the original proportion of organic to inorganic components, thus altering dentin\u2019s microhardness, solubility, permeability, flexural strength and surface roughness<sup>7,8</sup>. Such changes could influence the adhesive properties of root dentin and decrease root strength and fracture resistance<sup>9</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remineralization is a repair mechanism that aims to restore the mineral content of the tooth structure in ionic forms to the hydroxyapatite crystal lattice<sup>10</sup>. Dentin remineralization is more challenging than enamel remineralization because of the fewer amounts of residual mineral crystals in dentin and the presence of exposed collagen fibrils on the dentin surface. This complex structure limits the classical ion-based crystallization concept that is applicable for enamel. Herein, the concept of biomimetic remineralization appears, which imitates the natural process of mineralization<sup>11</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic compartment of dentin is composed mainly of collagen fibrils, in addition to non-collagenous proteins (NCPs) that compromise less than 10% of organic content. These NCPs have a high affinity for both calcium ions and collagen fibrils. They play a critical role in the regulation of mineralization in which they control the apatite nucleation and growth in dentin during mineralization. Biomimetic remineralization utilizes artificial NCP analogues to guide the calcium-phosphate recruitment to the collagen matrix<sup>11</sup>. Casein phosphopeptide \u2013 amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) is a protein nanotechnology introduced by Eric Reynolds and co-workers, in which CPP is a milk protein derivative that acts as NCP analogue<sup>10</sup>. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Biomimetic Remineralization (using CPP-ACP) of post space dentin previously treated with EDTA on push out bond strength of fiber post system with self-adhesive cement.</p>"
