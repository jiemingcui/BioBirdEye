            "content": "miRNAs are small RNAs ~18-22 nucleotides long that are important regulators of physiological and disease processes<sup>1-3</sup>. The short length of miRNAs presents challenges for quantification by traditional RNA detection methods. Techniques such as Northern blotting<sup>4</sup>, microarrays<sup>5,6</sup>, and RT-qPCR<sup>7-9</sup> have been modified in order to specifically detect and quantify miRNAs. RT-qPCR remains the most reliable, sensitive and scalable technology for miRNA quantification<sup>10</sup>. Nearly all methods require pure RNA from experimental samples as input for reliable results. At the same time, NGS has resulted in accelerated discovery of many novel miRNAs. In this light, an approach that allows assay customization, multiplexed detection of both annotated and novel miRNAs with minimum sample processing is highly desirable.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHere, we describe a protocol for efficient lysis, DNase treatment and direct, multiplexed reverse transcription of cultured cells, using a reaction buffer containing off-the-shelf surfactants that are commonly used in cell lysis<sup>8</sup>.  Using this protocol, we profiled the expressions of both annotated \\(miRBase release 15) and novel miRNAs rapidly and reliably from 10 to 10,000 cells and 10 different cell lines without the need for RNA isolation. This cost-effective, robust and reliable protocol for multiplexed detection of miRNAs increases the throughput of the assays enormously."

            "content": "Experimental design\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAn overview of experimental design is provided in Figure 1.\nSMRT-qPCR Assay Design\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe assay design process has been described \\(8) and is summarized in Figure 2a. Briefly, the mature miRNA sequence\\(s) of interest is retrieved from miRBase \\(http://www.mirbase.org/, current release 15). The reverse transcription \\(RT) primer is designed such that at the temperature used for reverse transcription it adopts a stable stem-loop structure \\(dG < -1.5), while under qPCR conditions the stem-loop structure is no longer favored \\(dG > -0.5). mFold software10 \\(http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/) is used to predict conformations and free energy values of the reverse transcription primer under the conditions used for reverse transcription and qPCR respectively \\(Fig. 2b). The last 6 nucleotides at the 3\u2019 end of the reverse transcription primer are the reverse complement of the last 6 nucleotides of the miRNA of interest.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA pair of qPCR primers is then designed where the reverse primer \\(with respect to the original miRNA sequence) extends at least one nucleotide beyond the 6 nucleotides used for reverse transcription priming while the 5\u2019 end anneals to the stem-loop region of the RT primer \\(Fig. 2a). The forward primer extends such that it is at most head-to-head with the reverse primer \\(i.e. PCR gap = 0 nt) and will usually requires a 5\u2019 GC rich sequence for efficient amplification. Due to the short lengths of the miRNAs, qPCR amplicons generated may be of almost indistinguishable size compared to primer-dimer products, unless dissociations are carried out using high-resolution melt analyses. It is thus critical to minimize primer-primer hybridization to avoid non-specific amplification. Most primer designing softwares \\(e.g. Beacon Designer, DNAman, Premier Primer) allow the evaluation of primer-primer complementarity. There is also a free online edition of Beacon Designer \\(http://www.premierbiosoft.com/qOligo/Sequence.jsp?PID=1) that is adequate for this purpose \\(Fig. 2c).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFigure 2.\nCell Culture\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCells can be lysed in a 96-well format to minimize reagents requirements. Typically, 10,000 cells can be seeded per well without being over-confluent or forming multiple-layers.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCell Lysis\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Observe wells using a microscope to ensure cells are evenly seeded within and between wells.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Prepare the lysis buffer as specified in Table 1.\r\n  \r\n\n\nIn our experience, as little as 25 \u00b5l of lysis buffer can be used to efficiently lyse up to 10,000 cells in 96-well format. This would result in significant reagent savings. However, it is advisable to first use 40 \u00b5l to ensure sufficient surface coverage and efficient lysis of cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Aspirate cell culture media from wells and wash cells gently once with 100 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline \\(PBS). Before lysis, remove PBS as completely as possible.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Add 40 \u00b5l of lysis buffer to cells. Gently triturate the cells, minimizing bubble formation.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Transfer the lysate from the cell culture wells to a 96-well PCR plate or PCR tubes as appropriate.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Centrifuge briefly to collect the lysate to the bottom of the wells/tubes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Incubate the lysate for 37\u00baC for 30 min, followed by 70\u00baC for 10 min to deactivate the DNase.\r\n  \r\n\n\nReverse Transcription \\(Timing: 35 min)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n8. Prepare the RT master mix as specified in Table 2:\r\n  \r\n\n\n9. Carefully aliquot RT master mix into the DNase-treated samples.\r\n  \r\n\n\n10. Vortex samples and centrifuge briefly to collect samples at the bottom of the wells/tubes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n11. Carry out the RT reaction at 42\u00baC for 30 min, followed by 70\u00baC for 5 min to inactivate the RT enzyme.\r\n  \r\n\n\nWe find that it is not necessary to allow primer annealing with an additional heating/cooling step in the presence of the RT primers.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPause point: The cDNA products may be stored at -20\u00baC for at least 1 year.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n12. Dilute cDNA product to 10% vol/vol with nuclease free water. Aliquot cDNA products into PCR reaction vessels.\r\n  \r\n\n\nQuantitative PCR \\(Timing : ~90 min depending on thermal cycler)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n13. Prepare the qPCR master mix as specified in Table 3.\r\n  \r\n\n\n14. Perform qPCR with the following thermal cycling parameters on an appropriate qPCR-enabled thermal cycler. Table 4 is an example of cycling parameters on the CFX96\u2122 Real-Time PCR System.\r\n  \r\n\n\n15. Analyze qPCR results with software compatible with the data generated."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "This protocol describes a method that guides researchers in designing assays for any miRNA of interest, andalso allows researchers to easily recover and quantify miRNAs without reliance on expensive proprietary kits. Using our novel assay design, we have previously shown that it is possible to effectively discriminate mature miRNAs from their precursors and almost identical homologs in multiplex. We here extend the approach to include very recently sequenced miRNAs for which no commercial assays are yet available yet. We further show that efficient lysis, recovery and detection of miRNAs are achievable with common reagents and basic enzymatic kits.",
