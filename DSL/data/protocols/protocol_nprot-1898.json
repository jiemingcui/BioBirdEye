In order to prevent waste from discarding expired media we frequently prepare 500ml volumes of hESc Feeder-Free Medium and Directed Differentiation Basal Medium without the growth factors and store 40ml aliquots at -20\u00baC. The required growth factor combinations are then added to thawed aliquots. We have not detected any adverse effects in cell cultures when using media that has been stored at -20\u00baC for up to 2 months from preparation.**\r\n\n\n_Growth factors:_\r\n\n\nGrowth factors are purchased as lyophilized powders which are reconstituted to a stock concentration with 0.1% \\(vol/vol) BSA in DPBS.

Aliquot the stock growth factor solution in 25\u03bcl volumes.\r\n\n\n**Critical: Growth factor polypeptides are highly unstable and biological activity decreases rapidly. Because of this lyophilized growth factors are assumed to be sterile on opening and reconstitution is carried out in a microbiological safety cabinet using aseptic technique. Growth factor solutions are never passed through 0.22\u03bcm filters and cell culture media are sterilized prior to the addition of growth factors. Once reconstituted the growth factor aliquots are transferred on ice for storage at -80\u00baC. Thawed aliquots are never re-frozen but are stored at 4\u00baC and discarded 14 days post-thaw.**\r\n\n\n_Reagents setup:_\r\n\n\nSee **Table 1** for the recipe to make MEF Medium\r\n\n\nSee **Table 2** for the recipe to make hESc Medium\r\n\n\nSee **Table 3** for the recipe to make hESc Feeder-Free Medium\r\n\n\nSee **Table 4** for the recipe to make Directed Differentiation Basal Medium"

We have progressively modified the protocols in these instruction manuals as we have become more experienced in hESc culture.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCritical: All cell culture procedures are carried out in a microbiological safety cabinet using aseptic technique. Because we do not supplement hESc Medium, hESc Feeder-Free Medium and Directed Differentiation Basal Medium with antibiotics it is essential that particular care is taken to maintain an aseptic environment. The cell culture incubators are cleaned monthly with a stringent biocide and rinsed with 70% \\(vol/vol) ethanol before running an internal autoclave cycle. Humidity within the cell culture incubators is maintained by filling water trays with autoclaved dH2O. The microbiological safety cabinet is cleaned weekly with a stringent biocide and rinsed with 70% \\(vol/vol) ethanol. During processing all reagents and equipment are sprayed liberally with 70% \\(vol/vol) ethanol before transfer into the microbiological safety cabinet and the operator wears a long sleeve Howie style laboratory coat and latex/nitrile gloves at all times. Cells are cultured at 37\u00baC in 5% Co2, atmospheric O2.\n**Preliminary**\r\n\n\n_hESc culture on Inactivated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast \\(iMEF) Feeder Cell Layer:_\r\n\n\n1. Transfer 1ml of 0.1% \\(vol/vol) gelatin to 1\u00d735mm culture dish and incubate in a cell culture incubator at 37\u00baC for 1 hour.\r\n  2. Remove one cryovial of iMEF cells from the liquid nitrogen cell storage dewar and place on ice for transfer to the cell culture suite.\r\n  3. Hold the cryovial by the lid and submerge three quarters of the cryovial in the 37\u00baC water bath for 2-3 minutes to thaw the cell suspension. **Tip: Swirl the cryovial in the water to facilitate heat transfer. Thaw the iMEF cells until approximately 10% of ice remains, the iMEF cells will continue to thaw during transfer to the microbiological safety cabinet.**\r\n  4. Draw up 4ml of MEF medium in a 5ml serological pipette and then the 1ml volume of iMEF cell suspension from the cryovial. Transfer the 5ml volume to a sterile 15ml polystyrene centrifuge tube.\r\n  5. Add 90\u03bcl of the iMEF cell suspension and 10\u03bcl of trypan blue solution to a 1.5ml microfuge tube and mix well by pipetting up and down. Transfer 10\u03bcl to each chamber of haemocytometer and perform a viable cell count. MEF cells are seeded at a cell density of 3\u00d7104 cells/cm2 which for a 35mm culture dish is 2.92\u00d7105 cells; calculate the volume of iMEF cell suspension required: 2.92\u00d7105 cells / viable cells/ml = Xml of MEF cell suspension. Transfer the calculated volume to a sterile 15ml polystyrene centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 720 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2ml of MEF medium \\(Table 1).\r\n  6. Take the 35mm culture dish with gelatin from the incubator, remove the gelatin and add the 2ml iMEF cell suspension. Transfer to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  7. Twenty-four hours post-seeding check the iMEF cells under the microscope to ensure that they have adhered to the cell culture surface and formed a homogeneous culture of approximately 80-85% confluence. \r\n  8. Thaw hESc and seed onto the iMEF layer. Remove a vial of hESc from liquid nitrogen storage and thaw as for the iMEF cells in steps 3-5 but substitute hESc medium \\(Table 2) for MEF medium. Centrifuge the hESc at 720 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature and resuspend the cell pellet in 2ml of hESc Medium. \r\n  9. Remove the iMEF medium from the iMEF cell layer and add the hESc suspension. Transfer the cell culture dish to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  10. Change the hESc medium every 2 days and check the hESc for growth under the microscope. Colonies of hESc can be observed growing between iMEF cells after approximately 2-4 days.\r\n  11. Passage the hESc at a ratio of 1:6 when the culture has grown to approximately 90-95% confluence. Prepare 6 wells of a 6 well culture dish with a iMEF feeder cell layer as described in steps 1-7. \r\n  12. Pre-warm a 10ml aliquot of Trypsin:EDTA and hESc medium by placing in the 37\u00baC water bath for 30 minutes. \r\n  13. Remove and discard the hESc medium from the hESc culture and add 1ml of Trypsin:EDTA. Incubate in the cell culture incubator at 37\u00baC and check under the microscope every 2-3 minutes for cell dissociation. iMEF cells are seen to round up whereas hESc can be seen to separate from each other. **Critical: Cell:cell contact is crucial in maintaining the hESc phenotype and so it is important that the hESc are not overexposed to the Trypsin:EDTA. The cells should remain in clumps of approximately 5-10 cells to permit the formation of new hESc colonies.**\r\n  14. Transfer the hESc suspension to a sterile 15ml polystyrene centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 720 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature. Resuspend the hESc in 12ml of hESc medium. \r\n  15. Remove the MEF medium from the wells of the 6 well culture dish and add 2ml of the hESc cell suspension to each well. Transfer the culture dish to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  **Tip: We frequently keep 1\u00d76 well cell culture dish of hESc in continuous culture on an iMEF feeder layer. When confluent 1 x well is passaged to another 6 well culture dish with iMEFs, 2 x wells are taken to establish feeder-free cultures and 3 wells are cryopreserved in order to maintain low passage stocks of hESc.**\r\n\n\n_Feeder-Free hESc Culture:_\r\n\n\n1. Prepare 35mm and 6 well culture dishes by transferring 1ml of 50\u03bcg/ml fibronectin to each well and incubating for at least 16 hours at 4\u00baC.\r\n  2. Remove and discard the hESc medium from 2 x wells of hESc iMEF cultures and rinse twice with DPBS.\r\n  3. Add 500\u03bcl of Trypsin:EDTA to each of the 2 wells and transfer to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  4. Check the hESc cultures every 2-3 minutes as if passaging the hESc cultures on to iMEF feeder cell layers. The Trypsin:EDTA can be left longer to permit more thorough dissociation of the hESc. \r\n  5. Transfer the cell suspension to a sterile 15ml polystyrene centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 720 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature. \r\n  6. Discard the supernatant and flick the bottom of the tube to disrupt the cell pellet. Resuspend the cells in a 2ml of hESc Feeder-Free Medium \\(Table 3). \r\n  7. Remove the 50\u03bcg/ml fibronectin from the 35mm culture dish and transfer to sterile 50ml centrifuge tube. **Tip: The 50\u03bcg/ml working solution of fibronectin can be reused up to three times if it remains at 4\u00baC.**\r\n  8. Add the 2ml volume of hESc cell suspension to the well coated with fibronectin and check under the microscope. **Critical: To establish feeder-free cultures hESc should be kept at a high cell density transferring 2 x wells of a 6 well culture dish to 1\u00d735mm culture dish to account for the inclusion of iMEFs. Cell-cell contact is important to maintain hESc phenotype, which is achieved through high cell density. Groups of 2-3 hESc not separated by the Trypsin:EDTA should still be present, however if large numbers of hESc remain aggregated together this will lead to the formation of embryoid bodies and differentiation.**\r\n  9. Return the 35mm culture dish to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  10. Check the hESc cultures every 24 hours under the microscope for adherence to the fibronectin-coated plastic and replace the hESc Feeder-Free Medium every 24-48 hours. **Tip: Feeder-free hESc adhere to the tissue culture plastic as colonies with prominent cell-cell contact. hESc appear larger and flatter than those cultured on iMEF feeder cell layers. Individual cells are seen as having characteristic large nucleus and prominent nucleoli. iMEF cells are often seen between hESc colonies.** \r\n  11. The feeder-free culture should be passaged at confluence after approximately 3-4 days. Remove the hESc Feeder-Free Medium from the well and add 500\u03bcl of pre-warmed Trypsin:EDTA. Incubate at room temperature and rock the 35mm culture dish back and forth gently. As soon as the hESc detach add 2ml of hESc Feeder-Free Medium to the well, draw up the hESc suspension and transfer to a sterile 15ml polystyrene centrifuge tube. Add another 2ml of hESc Feeder-Free Medium to the culture dish and rinse out the remaining cells from the well. Pool this with the hESc suspension in the 15ml tube. Centrifuge the hESc suspension at 720 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Flick the bottom of the centrifuge tube to disrupt the cell pellet and resuspend the hESc in 4ml volume of hESc Feeder-Free Medium. Transfer 2ml each to 2 x well of a 6 well cell culture dish coated with 50\u03bcg/ml fibronectin as described in step 1. Return the 6 well cell culture dish to the cell culture incubator. **Tip: It is important to maintain a high cell density as the hESc culture becomes established, plate cells at a density of approximately 0.8-1\u00d7105cells/cm2. Do not be tempted to passage the feeder-free hESc too early.** \r\n  12. Repeat steps 10-11 to expand the feeder-free hESc culture. The hESc become adapted to feeder-free culture with increasing passage and as such can be passaged at higher ratios. We routinely passage feeder-free hESc cultures at ratios of 1:3\u20131:4.\r\n  13. To cryopreserve feeder-free hESc cultures detach the cells as if passaging and resuspend the cell pellet in cryopreservation medium. Use 2ml of cryopreservation medium per 1 x confluent well of a 6-well dish \\(approximately 2\u00d7106 cells). Aliquot 1ml volumes into pre-labelled cryovials, place the cryovials into the \u201cMr Frosty\u201d and transfer to -80\u00baC. After 24 hours transfer the cryovials to a liquid nitrogen cell storage dewar.\r\n  **Directed Differentiation Protocol**\r\n\n\nThe directed differentiation protocol is carried out on feeder-free hESc which have been cultured off feeders for at least 3 passages to exclude contaminating iMEFs.\r\n\n\n1. Coat 1\u00d735mm culture dish by adding 1ml of 50\u03bcg/ml fibronectin and incubating overnight at 4\u00baC.\r\n  2. Detach feeder-free hESc from the cell culture plastic using pre-warmed Trypsin:EDTA, centrifuge at 720 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature and resuspend to a cell density of 5\u00d7105 cells/ml in hESc Feeder-Free Medium. \r\n  3. Remove the fibronectin solution from the well of the 35mm culture dish and add a 2ml volume of feeder-free hESc suspension.\r\n  4. Return the culture dish to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  5. After 24 hours check the hESc culture under the microscope. DDP should be initiated when the cultures are at approximately 80% confluence. Denote this as Day 1.\r\n  6. Prepare Day 1 medium by adding 6.25\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml mouse recombinant Wnt3a and 12.5\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml human recombinant Activin-A to 2.5ml of Directed Differentiation Basal Medium \\(Table 4).\r\n  7. Remove the hESc Feeder-Free Medium, rinse the feeder-free hESc culture three times with DPBS and add 2.5ml of Day 1 medium. Return to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  8. Day 2: add 6.25\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml mouse recombinant Wnt3a; 6.25\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml human recombinant Activin-A and 0.5\u03bcl of 100\u03bcg/ml human recombinant FGF2 to 2.5ml of Directed Differentiation Basal Medium.\r\n  9. Remove the Day 1 medium from the cell culture and replace with 2.5ml of Day 2 medium. Return to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  10. Day 3: add 6.25\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml mouse recombinant Wnt3a; 2.5\u03bcl of 10\u03bcl/ml human recombinant Activin-A; 0.5\u03bcl of 100\u03bcg/ml human recombinant FGF2 and 10\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml human recombinant BMP4 to 2.5ml of Directed Differentiation Basal Medium.\r\n  11. Remove the Day 2 medium from the cell culture and replace with 2.5ml of Day 3 medium. Return to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  12. Day 4: Analyse Stage 1 cultures if appropriate.\r\n  13. Add 0.5\u03bcl of 100\u03bcg/ml human recombinant FGF2; 10\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml human recombinant BMP4; 25\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml human recombinant follistatin and 0.5\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml human recombinant NT4 to 2.5ml of Directed Differentiation Basal Medium.\r\n  14. Remove the Day 3 medium from the cell culture and replace with 2.5ml of Day 4 medium. Return to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  15. Transfer 1ml of 50\u03bcg/ml fibronectin to each of 5 x wells of a 6 well culture dish and place at 4\u00baC.\r\n  16. Day 5: add 2\u03bcl of 100\u03bcg/ml human recombinant FGF2; 40\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml human recombinant BMP4; 100\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml human recombinant follistatin and 2\u03bcl of 10\u03bcg/ml human recombinant NT4 to 10ml of Directed Differentiation Basal Medium.\r\n  17. Remove the Day 4 medium from the cell culture and add 500\u03bcl of pre-warmed Trypsin:EDTA. Incubate at room temperature and rock the 35mm culture dish back and forth gently. As soon as the cells detach add 2ml of Directed Differentiation Basal Medium to the well, draw up the cell suspension and transfer to a sterile 15ml polystyrene centrifuge tube. Add another 2ml volume of Directed Differentiation Basal Medium to the culture dish and rinse out the remaining cells from the well. Pool this with the cell suspension. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 720 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Flick the bottom of the centrifuge tube to disrupt the cell pellet and resuspend the cells in 10ml of Day 5 Medium. Remove the 50\u03bcg/ml fibronectin solution and transfer 2ml of the cell suspension to each of the 5 wells. Return the culture dishes to the cell culture incubator.\r\n  18.

From a frozen ampoule of hESc it will take approximately 1 week for the culture to become established. After approximately 3-4 weeks of expansion by trypsin passage there will be enough hESc to begin establishing feeder-free cultures whilst maintaining cultures on iMEFs and cryopreserving low passage hESc stocks.\r\n\n\nFeeder-Free hESc Culture: Feeder-free hESc cultures are established over approximately 3-4 days and are passaged using trypsin upon confluence. Feeder-free hESc cultures are used in the Directed Differentiation Protocol after 3 passages to ensure that contaminating iMEF feeder cells are lost, approximately 10-14 days post initiation of feeder-free culture. Feeder-free hESc cultures can be cryopreserved and will take approximately 1-2 days to recover from frozen.\r\n\n\n_Directed Differentiation Protocol_: DDP takes 14 days to complete."

It is important that all of the components of the protocol are prepared and handled using aseptic technique and that the cell culture suite in which the work is carried out is maintained in an appropriately clean state.\r\n\n\nWe have observed that the efficiency in establishing and culturing feeder-free hESc as well as that of the directed differentiation protocol is sensitive to bioactivity of the growth factors used to supplement the media and also the fibronectin substrate. Be careful to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions in preparing the proteins, store the aliquots at -80\u00baC unless stated otherwise, avoid freeze-thaw cycles, always keep the growth factors below 4\u00baC and do not use aliquots that have been thawed for longer than 14 days."

Cell-cell contacts are prominent and individual cells are seen to have characteristic hESc morphology of large nucleus to cytoplasm ratio and prominent nucleoli. When the cell cultures are analyzed at the completion of Stage 1 \\(Day4) there are no apparent differences in gross morphology with cells retaining cell-cell contacts, large nucleus to cytoplasm ratios and prominent nucleoli \\(Figure 2b and 2c). Figure 2d and 2e shows morphological analyses at the end of Stage 2 \\(on day 9). The cultures are highly confluent \\(approximately 95%) and contain phase-bright cell clusters approximately 40-80\u03bcm in diameter \\(circled). On Day 12 \\(Figure 2f and 2g) the cell clusters are seen to have increased in size \\(circled). The flatter cells between the cell clusters are less firmly attached to the cell culture dish. At the completion of the Directed Differentiation Protocol \\(Day 14) the flatter cells are no longer present leaving independent cell aggregates across the culture. Cells within the aggregates are seen to have a rounded chondrocyte-like morphology \\(Figure 2h and 2i)."

The protocol is divided into three stages in which pluripotent hESc are directed towards primitive streak and mesendoderm (primitive streak/mesendoderm) (Stage 1), mesoderm (Stage 2) and then chondrocytes (Stage 3). Experimental techniques such as quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence can be used to monitor the expression of genes and proteins associated with each stage of differentiation. We carry out analyses using panels of genes/proteins to account for the broad ranges of expression kinetics during differentiation and the expression of the same gene/protein on multiple cell types. We also analyse the expression of genes/proteins associated with non-target cell types including those associated with neurectoderm, endoderm and haemangioblast cell populations to evaluate the efficiency of differentiation to chondrocytes.",

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Progress in generating robust differentiation protocols for efficient and scalable production of defined cell lineages from human embryonic stem cells \\(hESc) has been slow. Amongst the obstacles to be addressed are those inherent to standard hESc culture and differentiation practices including the use of feeder cells, serum and animal-derived matrices. These components are biologically complex, undefined and highly variable between batches, inhibiting the development of consistently reproducible protocols<sup>1,2</sup>. </p><p>We have developed for hESc a new 3-Stage directed differentiation protocol \\(DDP) to generate chondrocytes, the specialized cells that form cartilage tissue<sup>3</sup>. The protocol is segmented into stages that mimic the developmental processes that occur in cell lineage specification during embryogenesis. Pluripotent hESc, are established as feeder-free cultures<sup>4</sup> prior to DDP being carried out in monolayer culture on a sequence of matrix protein-coated surfaces with a chemically-defined medium sequentially supplemented with growth factors to direct differentiation through developmental intermediate cell populations of primitive streak/mesendoderm \\(Stage 1), mesoderm \\(Stage 2) and then chondrocytes \\(Stage 3) \\(Figure 1). </p><p>This unique protocol is highly efficient, scalable and completely chemically-defined, thus making it appropriate for translation towards clinical applications of chondrocytes, as well as providing a defined system for characterizing the molecular mechanisms regulating hESc differentiation.</p>",
