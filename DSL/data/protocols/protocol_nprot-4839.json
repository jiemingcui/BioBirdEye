            "content": "Democratisation of next-generation sequencing \\(NGS) technologies allowed researchers to study the human microbiome, the microbiome in oceans, soil or animals <sup>1,2,3,4</sup>. Bacteriome studies benefit greatly from the conserved regions of bacteria, targeting their conserved bacterial 16S ribosomal RNAs <sup>5,6</sup>. Although shotgun sequencing provides opportunities to analyse all microbial DNA, the larger average genome size of bacteria compared to viral genomes complicates a detailed analysis of the virome. In addition, often metagenomics approaches overlook viral RNA genomes present in the microbiome <sup>7</sup>.\r\n\n\nTo overcome this, we optimised different purification techniques in order to obtain the virome of various samples, including viruses infecting the host, viruses infecting eukaryotes present in the microbiota, viruses infecting prokaryotes present the microbiota \\(bacteriophages) and viruses infecting neither of them \\(e.g. plant viruses in the gut). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4439/thumbnail/srep16532-f1.png?1461936680\">See figure in Figures section.</a>"
