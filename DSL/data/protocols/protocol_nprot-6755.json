            "content": "Economically important plant crops often harbor significant heterozygosity levels. High heterozygosity can represent a source of allelic diversity which can be used to improve agronomic traits, but it is also a major obstacle to the assembly of crop genomes. Previously, genome sequencing initiatives tried to overcome this issue by reducing the level of genome heterozygosity, either by using inbred lines \\(woodland strawberry genome<sup>1</sup>) or by sequencing haploid megagametophyte \\(loblolly pine genome<sup>2</sup>). Inbred lines are not a realistic option when the organism is auto-incompatible with long generation time and solution of megagametophyte usually gives access to only a small amount of haploid DNA. Here, we used the rose as model species to develop a method that allows to create plant material with homozygous genome from a starting plant with highly heterozygous genome.\r\n\n\nThe genus\u00a0Rosa\u00a0represents a group of plants that appears to have undergone extensive reticulate evolution with interspecific hybridization, introgression and polyploidization. Crosses between Rosa species and cultivars have created complex polyploid cultivars that exhibited the most advantageous parent\u2019s traits such as recurrent flowering, good looking flowers, pleasant scent, cold hardiness and pathogen resistance<sup>3-5</sup>. As a consequence, cultivated roses exhibit high heterozygosity levels that hamper high quality genome assembly. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a protocol that allows Rosa chinensis \u2018Old Blush\u2019 microspores to switch from gametophyte to sporophyte development. We used a combination of fine-tuning a starvation medium, cold stress and hormonal treatments to induce microspores that initiate divisions and to form cell clusters \\(Figure 1) after about 11 weeks of culture. Clusters were developed and yielded both embryogenic and proliferating calli that were then maintained on various media."

            "content": "- R. chinensis \u2018Old Blush\u2019 plants are grown in a greenhouse at 25\u00b0C/19\u00b0C day/night temperature, with 16h/8h day/night supplemental light provided by sodium vapor and metal halide bulbs. Figure 1a shows a flower photo of \u2018Old Blush\u2019.\r\n\n\n- In a pilot experiment, harvest flower buds at different development stages, and assess microspore cytological stage by DAPI staining\n12\n: prepare a 5\u00b5g/mL DAPI working solution in citrate/phosphate buffer containing Triton X-100; dilacerate 2-3 anthers in this solution on a microscope slide, remove anther debris and apply a coverslip; observe with fluorescence microscope under UV excitation. This experiment should allow to identify the correct developmental stage based on approximate bud size and morphology, at which the majority of microspores are at the mid-late uninucleate/early bicellular cytological stages \\(Figure 1e-f), according to plant growing conditions. This stage approximately corresponds to when sepals just start to open up and when petals just become visible between sepal margins \\(Figure 1b).\r\n\n\n- Harvest ca. 10 flower buds at the correct development stage.\r\n\n\n- Surface-sterilize buds with Pursept\u00ae A Xpress for 1 minute, followed by a treatment with a bleach solution \\(1.5 % active chlorine) containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 15 minutes, with periodic manual stirring\r\n\n\n- Thoroughly rinse buds 4 times with sterile de-ionized water.\r\n\n\n- Aseptically dissect anthers from buds: longitudinally split open buds using a scalpel blade; then harvest anthers with forceps and transfer them into a glass vial containing 6 mL of B medium.\r\n\n\n- Isolate microspores as previously described7: stir for 2-3 min. at 1500 rpm \\(maximum speed), until the mixture of microspores, anther debris and medium becomes milky; collect the resulting suspension, and filter it through a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer \\(nylon sieve).\r\n\n\n- Centrifuge the filtrate at 100 g for 3 minutes; discard supernatant and carefully remove the top green layer of the two-layered pellet \\(which contains anther wall debris), using a 1 mL pipette or a P1000 micro-pipet.\r\n\n\n- Resuspend the whitish pellet composed of microspores in 6 mL B medium and centrifuge at 65 g for 3 minutes, discard supernatant. Repeat this procedure once more.\r\n\n\n- Discard the supernatant and resuspend well the microspore pellet in 3 mL B medium; immediately pipet a 100 \u00b5L aliquot for cell counting and for FCR/ DAPI assays.\r\n\n\n- Check microspore viability using FCR test\n13\n: add FDA \\(to 2 \u00b5g/mL) to a microspore suspension aliquot and observe with the fluorescence microscope under blue excitation. Viable microspores display a bright yellow/green fluorescence. A microspore viability rate around 50% or above is appropriate for the subsequent steps. This observation also provides indication about the cytological stage of the purified microspores.\r\n\n\n- Determine microspore number in the purified fraction, using a Malassez counting chamber.\r\n\n\n- Optional: check microspore cytological stages with DAPI staining applied to a microspore suspension aliquot, as described above.\r\n\n\n- Adjust microspore density to 100,000 microspores/mL with B medium.\r\n\n\n- Keep the microspore suspension at 4\u00b0C in darkness for 21 days in Falcon 353001 Petri dishes sealed with Parafilm\u00ae. Use about 1.5 mL microspore suspension per dish.\r\n\n\n- Rinse microspores twice with cold B medium with centrifugations at 50 g for 3 min at 4\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n- Suspend fractions containing about 160,000 microspores in 600 \u00b5L of AT12 medium. Incubate in a 12-well plate sealed with Parafilm\u00ae at 25\u00b0C in the dark.\r\n\n\n- After 3 weeks, replace the medium with 600 \u00b5L of fresh AT12 medium, by carefully pipeting with a P200 micropipet; re-seal the 12-well plate with Parafilm\u00ae and continue incubation at 25\u00b0C in the dark.\r\n\n\n- Observe for developing micro-calli \\(ca. 0.5 mm diameter). Developing micro-calli start to be seen about 8 weeks after subculture \\(Figure 1g).\r\n\n\n- Isolate developing micro-calli, under the stereo-microscope, by carefully pipetting them with a P200 micropipet \\(with cut tip). Subculture them individually in 300 \u00b5L of AT12 medium in a 24-well plate sealed with Parafilm\u00ae in the same conditions.\r\n\n\n- After 2 weeks, plate individual calli onto CM3 solid medium in 100 x 20 mm round tissue culture dishes \\(30 mL medium per dish), and incubate dishes at 25\u00b0C in darkness \\(Figure 1h).\r\n\n\n- After 7 weeks of culture, subculture developing calli once on CM3 medium for 12 weeks \\(30 mL medium per dish, 4 calli/dish), at 25\u00b0C in darkness.\r\n\n\n- Check for calli that display somatic embryos \\(Figure 1i).\r\n\n\n- For DNA isolation, harvest developing calli and propagate them by repeated subcultures every 4-6 weeks on callus maintenance medium\n10\nin 100 x 20 mm round dishes \\(30 mL medium per dish, 9 calli/dish), at 25\u00b0C in darkness.\r\n\n\n- For embryo production and further plantlet regeneration, propagate embryogenic calli by repeated subcultures of embryogenic tissues on EMM\n11\nin 100 x 20 mm dishes \\(33 mL medium per dish, 9 calli/dish), at 25\u00b0C with 16/8h day/night regime.\r\n\n\n- For plantlet regeneration, dissect cotyledons from embryogenic calli, plate them onto SIM in 100 x 20 mm dishes \\(33 mL medium per dish, 20 cotyledons/dish) and incubate them at 25\u00b0C with 16/8h day/night regime; after 4 weeks, dissect regenerated shoots and transfer them to multiplication medium, incubate them at 22\u00b0C with 16/8h day/night regime; propagate and maintain regenerated plantlets \\(Figure 1j) in the same conditions, by subculture every 4 weeks.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Homozygosity determination:**_\r\n\n\nTo check the homozygosity of developing embryogenic calli, either proceed \\(1) with High Resolution Melting \\(HRM) analyses using primer pairs known to amplify heterozygous loci. In our case, we used the Applied MeltDoctor TM HRM master mix; ThermoFisher Scientific following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; \\(2) by using SSR primers amplifying single heterozygous loci distributed along the chromosomes/genetic linkage groups; and/or \\(3) by observing the k-mer spectrum of Illumina reads derived from this homozygous material.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDNA genotyping \\(HRM) of isolated calli showed that all tested loci were homozygous \\(Figure 2a). All developing calli displayed the same homozygous profile indicating that they likely derived from a unique microspore development event. This callus was designated R. chinensis HzRDP12 \\(hereafter RcHzRDP12; Figure 1h,i). The k-mer spectrum of Illumina reads derived from RcHzRDP12 provided the final proof that the genome of RcHzRDP12 genome was homozygous, demonstrating a loss of heterozygosity in \u2018Old Blush\u2019 \\(Figure 2b). Experiments exploring the potential of RcHzRDP12 material have revealed that it is possible to maintain the embryogenic capacity of produced calli through several subcultures. Furthermore, we readily able to regenerate plantlets with normal morphological phenotype from RcHzRDP12 somatic embryos \\(Figure 1j). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_**Ploidy determination:**_\r\n\n\nTo determine the ploidy level of the developed homozygous calli and plants, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting \\(FACS) analysis:\r\n\n\n- Isolate nuclei from homozygous calli samples or from young leaves of regenerated plantlets, as previously described\n14\n. Leaves from the heterozygous \u2018Old Blush\u2019 rose plants from which the homozygous material derives was used as control.\r\n\n\n- Stain by adding 1\u00b5g/ml DAPI \\(Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature. In our case, FACS analyses were performed using MACSQuant VYB \\(Miltenyi Biotec) cytometer and analyzed by FlowJo software \\(FlowJo LLC). \r\n\n\n- Compare the ploidy profile of the homozygous material with that of the heterozygous mother plant used as a control.\r\n\n\nIn our case, one major peak corresponding to diploid \\(2N) cells was observed after DAPI staining for RcHzRDP12 \\(Figure 2c) and the ploidy profile of the homozygous rose material was identical to that of the heterozygous rose R. chinensis \u2018Old Blush\u2019 mother plant, used as a control. In all samples, the majority of cells were diploid and low proportion of polyploid cells \\(4N and 8N), frequently observed in young tissues, was detected. These data demonstrate that haploid cells originating from the homozygous callus did undergo spontaneous genome duplication during regeneration resulting in diploid homozygous R. chinensis \u2018Old blush\u2019 callus and plant material."

            "content": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the production of a homozygous rose plantlet. The use of such approach opens possibilities to implement haplo-methods in rose genetics and breeding. \r\n\n\nThis protocol offers a rigorous and reproducible method for deriving homozygous material from heterozygous tissue. This enables a two-fold reduction of the genome complexity, which is useful for producing high-quality genome assembly. Future prospects could include the sequencing of independent haploidization events, in order to retrieve and assemble parental haplotypes of hybrid species and cultivars. Equally important, this possibility to generate Recombinant Inbred Like materials paves the way for novel breeding strategies in roses, e.g. F1 breeding or reverse breeding. With respect to more fundamental research, availability of homozygous rose genotypes may foster the study of a number of processes in simpler genetic models \\(e.g. developmental mechanisms or metabolic pathways). In particular, homozygous genotypes represent promising models for functional genetics."

The top plot displays two peaks, at 211 and 444, denoting the existence of two types of regions in the genome: some present in one copy (occ.=211), and some present in two copies (occ.=444 \u22482*211), consistent with the hypothesis that most of the genome is highly heterozygous (one copy), while a smaller part is homozygous (two copies). In the homozygous genome (bottom plot), only one peak remains, confirming that we extracted one single haplotype from R. chinensis \u2018Old Blush\u2019 heterozygous genome; a very small bump can be seen on the right (occ.=157), which could correspond to tandem duplications in the extracted haplotype. \r\nc, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis shows that the obtained homozygous RcHzRDP12 underwent spontaneous genome duplication during regeneration resulting in diploid homozygous callus with a similar ploidy profile as the heterozygous R. chinensis \u2018Old Blush\u2019 plants.\r\n",

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Like many economically important plants, roses exhibit high heterozygosity levels. Here, we report the development of a protocol that allows rose microspores to switch from gametophyte to sporophyte development. Using a combination of starvation medium fine-tuning, cold stress and hormonal treatments we were able to induce microspores to initiate divisions and form cell clusters from which embryogenic and proliferating calli could be obtained. DNA genotyping showed that the genome of these calli was homozygous, demonstrating the loss of heterozygosity in the rose. Homozygous calli maintained their embryogenic capacity through several subcultures. Plantlets with normal morphological phenotype could be regenerated from the homozygous embryos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the production of a homozygous rose plantlet. The use of such approach helps reduce genome complexity to obtain high quality genome assembly and also opens possibilities to implement haplomethods in rose genetics and breeding.",
