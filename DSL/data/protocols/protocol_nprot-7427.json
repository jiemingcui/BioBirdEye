Then the reaction was stirred at 50 oC for 2h, TLC showed the reaction was consumed completely. The mixture was purified by prep-TLC \\(1H NMR showed the product is not pure). The reaction was repeated at 910 mg scale to give B-6 700 mg.\n  \n\n\n7. Preparation of B-7 - To a solution of B-6 \\(30 mg, 0.081 mmol) in MeOH \\(3 mL) was added NaBH4 \\(3 mg, 0.081 mmol) at 0 oC and the reaction was stirred at r.t. for 2h, TLC showed the reaction was consumed completely. The mixture was purified by prep-TLC. 1H NMR showed the structure was correct. The reaction was repeated at 700 mg scale to give B-7 370 mg.\n  \n\n\n8. Preparation of B - To a solution of B-7 \\(100 mg, 0.291 mmol) and CBr4 \\(116 mg, 0.350 mmol) in DCM was added PPh3 \\(92 mg, 0.350 mmol) 0 oC under Ar. Then the reaction was stirred at r.t. overnight. The mixture was purified by prep-TLC. 1H NMR showed the structure was correct. The reaction was repeated at 700 mg scale to give B 630 mg. 1H NMR \\(400 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 7.59 \\(s, 1H), 7.32\\(s, 1H), 5.23\\(d, J = 6.0 Hz, 1H), 4.17-4.10\\(m, 4H), 3.99\\(s, 3H), 3.70-3.47\\(m, 4H), 2.54\\(t, J = 7.2Hz, 2H), 2.19\\(m, 2H), 1.54\\(m, 3H), 1.27\\(t, J = 7.2 Hz, 3H).\n  \n\n\n9.

The reaction was repeated at 40 mg scale, and the mixture was purified by prep-TLC to give 30 mg crude product \\(purity: 82.3%), then the crude was purified by HPLC to give 11.7 mg product \\(purity: 93.6%). Further purifications by prep-TLC gave the target compound. The reaction was repeated at 30 mg scale, and two batches of product were combined and twice purified via prep-TLC to give 12.0 mg target compound. MS: 1108\\[M+1]+. HPLC Purity @ 254 nm: 98.2%"
