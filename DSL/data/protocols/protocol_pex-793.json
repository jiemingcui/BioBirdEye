fetal bovine serum (FBS) to the remaining volume of MEM.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 5 mL of 100X penicillin/streptomycin to the medium.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 5 mL of 100X MEM non-essential amino acids (NEAA) to the medium.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 5 mL of 100mM sodium pyruvate to the medium.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mix thoroughly and label with the date and additives.\nCollagen Coating of Tissue Culture Plates\nIMR90 cells should be grown on dishes/plates/inserts that have been coated with 50 mg/mL bovine collagen I solution according to the separate method \u201cCollagen Coating for Tissue Culture\u201d.\nThawing Cryopreserved Cells\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Warm medium and prepare materials prior to obtaining a vial of cells from cryostorage.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This reduces the amount of time cells are thawed in the presence of DMSO.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove vial from liquid nitrogen (wearing eye protection) and thaw in 37 \u00b0C water bath (1-2 min).\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is important that cells are thawed quickly to prevent damage and reduced viability.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 24 mL of growth medium to a 50 mL conical tube then transfer the thawed cells from the cryovial into the growth medium and gently mix by inversion.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pellet cells via centrifugation at 1,000 x\ng\nfor 4 minutes at room temperature.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carefully aspirate the supernatant.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gently resuspend the cells in 12 mL of pre-warmed growth medium, add 13 mL of additional growth medium, and transfer into a collagen-coated 15 cm dish.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate in a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO\n2\nand 20% O\n2\novernight.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Check cells the following day for attachment to the dish.\u00a0Replace medium to remove dead cells (rounded, unattached cells).\u00a0It is preferable to culture thawed cells for at least three passages before using in experiments.\na.\nNOTE:\nCells may require being cultured until the fourth day after thawing prior to being ready to be passaged for the first time.\nSub-Culturing Cells\nCells should be split three days after being plated at 4.0 x 10\n4\ncells/mL\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lower APD IMR90 cells grow very quickly and should be plated at 3.5 x 10\n4\ncells/mL to start and then adjusted up to 4.0 x 10\n4\ncells/mL accordingly as their growth rate slows down.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pre-warm growth medium and PBS in a 37\u00b0C water bath and a trypsin aliquot at room temperature (~30 minutes).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the cell culture medium.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rinse cells with pre-warmed PBS and swirl gently.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a020 mL for 15 cm dishes\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010 mL for 10 cm dishes\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the PBS wash.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add trypsin and rotate to spread evenly across the plate.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.5 mL for 15 cm dish\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0750 \u03bcL for 10 cm dish\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place in 37\u00b0C incubator for 4 minutes, making sure not to stack dishes on top of each other.\u00a0Following incubation, use the palm of your hand to hit the side of the dish to facilitate detachment.\u00a0If cells are still attached, incubate for another 2 minutes.\u00a0Incubate and tap dish until >95% of the cells are detached.\u00a0Check detachment with microscope.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 12 mL medium and gently wash the surface of the dish with a pipette and triturate once to break up any large cell clumps.\u00a0Transfer to a 50 mL conical tube.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash the dish with an additional 12 mL of medium, collect, triturate, and add to the cell suspension from Step #7.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge at 1,000 x\ng\nfor 4 minutes to pellet cells.\n10.\u00a0Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 12 mL of medium.\u00a0Triturate at least four times to thoroughly break up the majority of clumped cells.\u00a0Add additional growth medium to dilute the cell suspension if desired.\u00a0Typically, medium is added such that there is a total volume of 12 mL per 2-3 15 cm plates collected.\n11.\u00a0Prepare a 1:1 dilution in Trypan Blue (50 \u03bcL Trypan Blue + 50 \u03bcL cell suspension) in an Eppendorf tube.\n12.\u00a0Count cells that exclude Trypan Blue on a hemocytometer (do not use an automated cell counter as these cells display variability in size and are not accurately quantified by automated methods).\na.\nNOTE\n: Blue staining of cells indicates a damaged membrane.\u00a0Blue-stained cells are considered to be non-viable.\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Record the number of cells obtained per plate.\nc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculate the number of population doublings that occurred during the last passage (include the indicated values in the associated worksheet):\n([(3.32(log(cells collected per plate)-log(cells plated per plate)) + previous APD])\n13.\u00a0Dilute cells to 4.0 x 10\n4\ncells/mL (or 5.0 x 10\n4\ncells/mL for IMR90-UNC cells) in growth medium in a 50 mL tube or larger sterile bottle to the total volume that will be used for plating (10 mL for each 10 cm plate and 25 mL for each 15 cm plate, making 2-5 mL extra).\n14.\u00a0Mix thoroughly by inversion and dispense the diluted cell suspension into each dish.\n15.\u00a0Incubate in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nand 20% O\n2\n.\u00a0Cells will be ready to split three days after plating.\na.\nNOTE:\nPlating cells at a determined cell density will result in more predictable sub-culture and more reproducible performance in subsequent experimental assays.\n16.\u00a0Place bottles of medium and PBS in 5% CO\n2\nincubator with lids partially unscrewed for 15 minutes to adjust pH before returning to 4 \u00b0C fridge to store.\nPreparing Cells for Cryopreservation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare freezing medium.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a050% FBS, 40% growth medium, 10% DMSO.\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filter through a 0.2 \u03bcm pore syringe filter.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Follow sub-culturing protocol through Step #10.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determine the number of cells present and pellet cells by centrifugation at 1,000 x\ng\nfor 4 minutes at room temperature.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend the cell pellet at a density of 1.25 x 10\n6\ncells/mL in freezing medium.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aliquot into cryovials (1 mL per vial).\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put vials in a Mr. Frosty controlled freezing container (filled to indicated line with isopropyl alcohol) and place in a -80\u00b0C freezer overnight.\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The chamber regulates cooling rate at about 1\u00b0C per minute.\nb.\nNOTE:\nIsopropanol should be changed after every three freezing cycles.\nc.\nNOTE:\nDo not leave vials at -80\u00b0C longer than overnight as it will impact viability after thawing.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put the frozen vials in liquid nitrogen storage."
