            "content": "Hematopoietic stem cells \\(HSCs) replenish the blood cells throughout the lifetime of an individual, and can be used for transplantation in patients to treat malignant and non-malignant blood disorders. The urgent need to develop an alternative source of HSCs to matched adult donors, such as HSCs derived in\u00a0vitro from pluripotent stem cells, requires increased mechanistic understanding of HSC development. Cyclic AMP-mediated regulation of adult hematopoiesis is described in studies showing that cAMP increases CXCR4 expression and motility of hematopoietic progenitors <sup>1</sup>, HSCs from Gs\u03b1-deficient mice do not engraft <sup>2</sup>, and Gs\u03b1-deficient osteocytes alter the BM niche,\u00a0leading to defective hematopoiesis <sup>3</sup>. In\u00a0human hematopoietic cells, prostaglandin E2 \\(PGE2)-mediated cAMP activation increases human cord blood engraftment potential <sup>4, 5</sup>. Recently, cAMP was shown to regulate hematopoietic emergence and homing in studies where cAMP was upregulated by adenosine in zebrafish and mouse <sup>6</sup>, PGE2 in zebrafish and mouse <sup>7-10</sup>, and by shear stress in murine AGM <sup>11</sup>. However, the role and mechanism of cAMP signaling in regulating human developmental hematopoiesis has not been adequately studied, and no study has been performed on the role of cAMP in the human hematopoietic developmental context. Human pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells <sup>12</sup> and induced pluripotent stem cells \\(iPSCs) <sup>13</sup> provide an ideal in\u00a0vitro model to recapitulate human hematopoietic development. Recent studies have functionally demonstrated an endothelial precursor to blood \\(hemogenic endothelium) from hPSC differentiation cultures <sup>14, 15</sup>, further establishing hPSCs as a suitable model to study human hematopoietic\u00a0cell development. However, the signals regulating hemogenic endothelium and newly emergent HSCs in the human developmental context remain unexplored. As cAMP-mediated regulation of human hematopoietic cell emergence is undefined, we investigated the role of cAMP signaling in the development of hematopoietic progenitors from hPSCs. Here, we demonstrate a methodology where cAMP induction during hPSC-to-hematopoietic differentiation increases the frequency of cells with HSC-like surface phenotype. Using this strategy, we further demonstrate that cAMP induction leads to decreased oxidative burden in the hematopoietic cells, upregulates the anti-oxidant program, and enhances CXCR4 expression on hematopoietic cells."

Mechanisms behind human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell development remain elusive. Using a human pluripotent stem cell differentiation system, we show that cyclic AMP \\(cAMP) induction increases HSC-like cell frequencies. Furthermore, in hematopoietic progenitor and stem-like cells, cAMP induction decreased the oxidative stress, created a redox-state balance, and enhanced C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 \\(CXCR4) expression, thus benefiting the maintenance of these primitive cells. Our work provides new strategies to upregulate hematopoietic cell generation, and advances the mechanistic understanding of hematopoietic development towards developing transplantable human hematopoietic cells for therapeutic purposes.",
