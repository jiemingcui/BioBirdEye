            "content": "<p>EMSA is a powerful method to detect the direct interaction between a protein (e.g. transcription factor) and a DNA fragment (Chen, 2011). Typically, a protein-bound DNA probe moves slower than the free-DNA probes in a gel. This protein-DNA complex can be observed as a shifted band and the free-DNA probes move faster toward the bottom of the gel. Based on this characteristic, the DNA probes can be labeled with Biotin and the shifted band can be visualized via chemiluminescence.</p><p><br></p>"
