            "content": "Genetic transformation of sugar beet is characterized by a low efficiency owing to the poor competence of its cells to both transformation and regeneration procedures \\(Wozniak, 1999). To circumvent the problems arising due to sugar beet\u2019s recalcitrance, _Agrobacterium rhizogenes_-mediated transformation is an attractive alternative system to study transgene expression and effect on root traits such as pathogen and pest resistance, abiotic stress tolerance and water and/or nutrient uptake. By analogy to _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_, used in standard transformation techniques, _A. rhizogenes_ transfers a T-DNA segment from its root-inducing \\(Ri) plasmid into the genome of infected plant cells. Upon expression of the root locus \\(rol) genes, auxin and cytokinin biosynthesis is modified in a manner that promotes rapid proliferation of adventitious roots emerging at the wounding site, called hairy roots. The phenotype of the transformed roots is similar in structure to that of the wild type roots but is characterized by a fast hormone-independent growth, a high lateral branching and a plagiotropic root development.\r\n\n\nHere, we describe a fast, technically simple and highly reproducible protocol for an efficient root transformation of varieties and accessions of sugar beet using the _A. rhizogenes_ strain R1000."

Using this methodology, we achieved high transformation efficiency \\(>96%) for all types of genetic material used and more importantly succeeded in utilizing these roots to study the function of various transgenes. In the light of plant\u2019s recalcitrance aforementioned, given its high efficiency and reproducibility, the protocol described provides an attractive system for the study of transgene expression. Such hairy root system can be exploited as a suitable platform for the evaluation of transgene effectiveness in improving traits like root pathogen and pest resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, water and nutrient uptake, provided that relevant evaluation assays are available or can be developed. We are currently testing the possibility to exploit this hairy root system in studying drought resistance genes as well as for the production of novel protein molecules."
