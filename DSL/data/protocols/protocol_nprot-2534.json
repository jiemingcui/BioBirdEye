            "content": "Plant-derived agents, owing to their diversity in structure and bioactivity1-6, play critical roles in pharmaceutical research. They provide lead compounds for biopharmaceutical technology and supply an economical ways for the discovery of new drugs. The drugs, which are used widely in modern medicine, mostly derived from natural compounds and their derivatives. For example, aspirin was originated from salicylic acid in the bark of the willow tree \\(Salix species), which is used traditionally to treat fever and inflammation in many cultures worldwide7. The successes of the early \u201cblockbuster\u201d drugs set the stage for ongoing drug discovery efforts from medicinal plants. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe screening of bioactive ingredients based on targets recognition attracts researchers\u2019 attention8-10. Nevertheless, these methods can hardly be applied in direct screening of bioactive ingredients from plants extracts which compose of various compounds with different contents. Currently screening from plant extracts against specific targets always follows the strategy of \u201cIsolation \uf0ae Structure identification\uf0aeActivity confirmation\u201d. Yagura et al.11 isolated isosalipurposide for anticarcinogenic compounds in the Uzbek medicinal plant by bioactivity-directed fractionation. Bai et al.12 screen the G-quadruplex ligands from Kalopanax septemlobus \\(Thunb) Koidz extract by high performance liquid chromatography \\(HPLC). Compared with these methods, our method will accelerate the screening process of lead components greatly by providing the structural information of bioactive ingredients without isolating the ligand\\(s) molecules experimentally. Thus it provides chemists and pharmacologists with useful info to optimize lead compound for the final drug in a more rapid way.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe implementation of our goal benefits from the powerful NMR techniques. NMR has now become an important tool in drug discovery13-19, owing to its advantage in structure identification. But the complexity and overlapping of signals in complex systems bring difficulties in the recognition of spectra. With the development of spectral editing NMR techniques, selected useful information also can be obtained. Among these techniques, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy \\(DOSY) and relaxation-edited methods are two successful examples20-23, which could provide means for signal filtering and selecting, and consequently achieve \u201cvirtual separation\u201d. In this protocol, DOSY and relaxation-edited NMR techniques are used to screen the bioactive ingredients interacting with target in medicinal plant extracts.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOur method has drawn a profound attention on screening bioactive ingredients from medicinal plants and there are many reviews commenting on it24, 25. The reviewer of Angewandte Chemie International Edition pointed out that the predominance of this method was integration screening and structure identification, which carried out the fast screening and structure identification of bioactive ingredients in natural plant extracts. Nature China highlighted this method and commented on it with Screening Methods: Looking for Ligands as title. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn order to introduce this method to more researchers who devote to search the bioactive ingredients in natural plant extracts and provide convenience for their works, it is necessary to describe this method in detail and define standard protocol in order to ensure the correct usage of this method. Here we take the screening and identifying ligands from the extract of Phellodendron chinense Schneid cortexes \\(PE)26 based on G-quadruplex and the extract of Flos Lonicera Japonica \\(FLJ) based on Avian Influenza Polymerase Protein PAC by using NMR as examples to define well-tested procedures.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nExperimental design\r\n\n\nThe biomolecules which are reported to have important physiological significance can be used as targets. To be specific, our protocol takes G-quadruplex and Avian Influenza Polymerase Protein PAC \\(carboxyterminal domain of PA) as examples. \r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nG-quadruplexes27,28 can inhibit the activity of telomerase29 and play an important role in suppression of carcinogenesis30-33. The ligands of G-quadruplex have the potential for the arrest of cancer-cell growth and may be potentially valuable as antitumor drugs34-36. The interaction of G-quadruplex and its ligand affects the chemical shifts of imino protons in G-quadruplex, which locate low-field region \\(10-12 ppm) of NMR spectra.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nAdditionally, the ligand of protein also can be obtained by using spectrally-filtered editing NMR techniques. For PAC, the drugs discovered by it may be effective against most influenza strains less susceptible to drug resistance due to the high conservation of the active sites in PAC37. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe medicinal plant extracts which are reported to treat some kind of disease can be used as candidates for the corresponding targets. PE is chosen as a candidate because it is reported to be benefit for the treatment of cancer and contain G-quadruplex ligands38. FLJ is chosen as a candidate because it is reported to be benefit for the treatment of viral infection such as influenza A virus39. The concentration of medicinal plant extracts depends on the concentration of bioactive ingredients. The concentration of medicinal plant extracts should be benefit for observing the obvious changes from the characteristic signals of the targets.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThere are three steps in this process \\(Figure 1): First, it is necessary to choose the suitable NMR sequence according to the target. To be specific, if there are not clear and characteristic signals of target in NMR spectroscopy, relaxation-edited NMR is preferred. Otherwise, DOSY is suitable. For example, G-quadruplex has the characteristic peaks around \u03b4 10-12 ppm which are clear and not easy to be interfered by other components. In this case, DOSY can be chose. But for proteins they usually have high molecular weights, thus their peak profiles are broadened and there are uneasy to be identified. In this case, relaxation-edited NMR can be chose. Second, judge the existence of ligand\\(s) and determine the proton signals of ligand\\(s) by spectral editing NMR techniques in the extracts. For example, G-quadruplex is taken as target in DOSY. As long as the ligand\\(s) binds to G-quadruplex, the chemical shifts and intensities of imino protons of G-quadruplex which are clear and characteristic signals of G-quadruplex change and the change is easy to be detected. Then extract the signal of ligand\\(s) by DOSY. In the relaxation-edited NMR spectra, through the comparison with the spectrum of extract without PAC, the peak of ligand can be picked out. Third, further structural illumination is used to identify the ligand\\(s) by <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HSQC and HMBC from the signal obtained in step 2.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLimits of applicability and practical considerations\r\n\n\nIf there were bioactive ingredients in medicinal plant extracts and their structures were unknown, this protocol could be employed to find them out. As long as the signals of the ingredients which could interact with the target could be distinguished in NMR spectroscopy, this protocol could be used to identify their structures without isolation. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAlthough it provided a fast approach to structurally determine bioactive ingredients, this method had some limitations. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFirstly, the content of bioactive ingredients in the extracts is a key factor that influences the result. For example, the G-quadruplex ligand detected in PE is about 0.06% \\(mass concentration). If there is more than one ligand in test extracts, the content of each ligand dominates the priority of ligands identified in test extracts in this protocol. For a multiligand system such as extracts of Coptis chinensis Franch rhizomes \\(CE)26 which contains at least two ligands \\(berberine and palmatine) with similar G-quadruplex binding ability, the ligand with the higher content tend to be identified and that with lower content may be omitted.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe second factor is the requirement of the target. Because our protocol bases on NMR techniques, generally the target must meet the demands in NMR experiments, such as the concentration and molecular weight40. To be specific, it requires the relatively high concentration \\(mM level) of target when the molecular weight of target is about ten thousand owing to the sensitivity of DOSY."

            "content": "EQUIPMENT SETUP\r\n\n\nNMR setup The high-resolution NMR spectroscopy could be used for screening and identifying new bioactive ingredients42. In the following, experimental methods are described using a Bruker NMR spectrometer as an example. Some common pulse techniques can be employed to screen bioactive ingredients with futher structure identification, such as standard Bruker pulse program p3919gp, stebpgp1s19, cpmgpr1d, hsqcetgp and hmbcgplpndqf.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSetup on NMR spectrometers of other vendors will require adjustment accordingly. In order to obtain maximum benefit from acquiring NMR spectra, the parameters need to be set accurately. Generally, all NMR experiments should be acquired at 298.2K.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHomogenization of the magnetic field \\(\u2018shimming\u2019) for samples is important for conventional NMR probes. This can be done with TopShim on Bruker spectrometers \\(TopSpin 2.1). The homogenization of the magnetic field can be confirmed by the peak profile of TSP which is a single peak at 0ppm. \r\n\n\nThe number of scans per experiment for different medicinal plant extracts can be adjusted according to the signal-to-noise ratio of the components of interest, but this will have an impact on the overall experiment time per sample.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWater suppression When observing protons, the dynamic range of the detection can be strongly limited by the size of the water peak and the results in the signal loss for low concentration substances. Hence, the water peak has to be suppressed by using the pulse program p3919gp that applies 3\u20139\u201319 pulses with gradients for water suppression43 to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of ligands. Other spectrometer manufacturers provide the same pulse sequences, but they have different names and syntax; please discuss with the supplier.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe parameters are optimized to give optimum suppression of the water resonance without reducing the signal intensity of the compound signals next to it. It is recommended to automatically adjust the receiver gain before acquiring the spectra.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nAll NMR experiments require correct setting of 90\u00b0 pulse length. It is a key to determine the offset of the water signal for the water suppression.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDOSY To get the actual gradient strength in absolute values, it is necessary to obtain a gradient calibration constant, which is used by the AU program dosy to calculate and store the list \\(difflist) containing absolute gradient strength values. This list is used by the processing tools to calculate the correct diffusion constants.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe gradient strength \\(g), diffusion time big delta \\(\u0394) and diffusion gradient length little delta \\(\u03b4) are important factors in DOSY experiment. It is necessary to optimize these three parameters to detect the whole decay function properly. Selecting the right values for \u0394 or \u03b4 is important to get good diffusion constants with less error.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nUsing 1D versions of the diffusion pulse program for optimizing the \u0394 \\(d20) and \u03b4 \\(p30), experiments are carried out by comparing two spectra with different amplitude \\(gpz6) 2% and 95%. The parameters are set when the signal decay goes down to 5% residual signal. The comparison is convenient in dual display.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCpmgpr: The relaxation-edited NMR experiments utilized a \\[D/pre-saturation-90x-\\(\u0394-180y-\u0394)n-acquire] pulse sequence, in which the CPMG sequence was used for the spin-lock.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStructure identification using 2D NMR spectroscopy Two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy is employed for identifying the connectivity between signals. <sup>1</sup>H\u2013<sup>13</sup>C HSQC and HMBC NMR spectra are used for structural identification44, as they highlight connectivities of protons directly attached to the carbon atoms in a molecule."

Once these spectra have been obtained, they will require phasing and baseline correction before being subjected to further analysis.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe <sup>1</sup>H spectra of G-quadruplex d\\(TTGGGTT)4 with different plant extracts \\[with or without G-quadruplex ligand\\(s)], are shown in Figure 2.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe evident differences in the imino region \\(10\u201312 ppm) in the 1H NMR spectra of free and bound G-quadruplexes47 can be utilized as a spectroscopic means indicating the existence/nonexistence of G-quadruplex ligand\\(s) in the test extracts. As shown in Figure 2, when lentinan \\(without G-quadruplex ligand) is added into the d\\(TTGGGTT)4, the chemical shift and intensity of G3-G5 are unchanged. However, when PE \\(with G-quadruplex ligand) is added into the d\\(TTGGGTT)4, a clear upfield shift of the guanine imino proton resonance signals was observed and signal intensity, especially that of G5 dropped greatly.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFigure 3 shows that DOSY analysis of a mixture of PE and d-\\(TTGGGTT)4. Based on the principle of DOSY, if the component binds to d-\\(TTGGGTT)4,  the component has the same diffusion coefficient with d-\\(TTGGGTT)4. The characteristic peaks of d-\\(TTGGGTT)4 are around \u03b4 10-12. In Figure 3, the peak around \u03b4 9 ppm has the same ordinate with the peaks around \u03b4 10-12 which means the components from \u03b4 9 ppm have the same diffusion coefficient with d-\\(TTGGGTT)4. Additionally no such peak appears in the spectrum of the G-quadruplex alone. This result, together with a consideration of the sharp drop in the diffusion coefficient of the proton that resonates around \u03b4 9 ppm in the two samples \\(4.8\u00d710<sup>-10</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in PE and 1.4\u00d710<sup>-10</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in a mixture of PE and d-\\(TTGGGTT)4  respectively), led us to reasonably conclude that this peak resulted from the compound in PE bound to G-quadruplex.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAccording to the peak at \u03b4 9 ppm, the structure of the berberine could be recognized by analyzing the HSQC and HMBC spectra of PE26. \\(Supplement)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe relaxation-edited NMR spectra of FLJ in the absence and presence of PAC and the difference spectrum are shown in Figure 4.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn order to identify the PAC ligand from the mixtures, relaxation-edited NMR with Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill \\(CPMG) spin-lock was applied to FLJ extract in the absence and presence of PAC. As shown in Figure 4b, the application of CPMG spin-lock will reduce the ligand peaks due to its relatively fast R2 upon binding. However, these signals were not influenced in the absence of target \\(Figure 4a). This difference was highlighted in the difference spectrum \\(Figure 4c). These attenuated peaks can be ascribed to the PAC ligand in the extract. Thus, the ligand peaks can be \u201cpicked out\u201d from the mixture without previous isolation. The next step is to identify which molecule in the mixture is bound to PAC. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBased on the characteristic signals picked out by relaxation-edited NMR, structure elucidation was carried out using the subsequent 2DNMR experiments, such as HSQC, HMBC, and total correlation spectroscopy \\(TOCSY). Followed by proton-carbon connections, proton-carbon long-range correlations, and proton-proton correlations provided by these 2DNMR experiments, the molecular frame of the ligand can be built. The PAC ligand can be then identified to be chlorogenic acid."

NMR spectroscopies described here are <sup>1</sup>H NMR, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy \\(DOSY), relaxation-edited NMR, <sup>1</sup>H\u2013<sup>13</sup>C HSQC and HMBC. This method includes three steps: First, investigate the NMR spectroscopy properties of target and choose the suitable spectral editing NMR method; second, judge the existence of ligand\\(s) and determine the proton signals of ligand\\(s) in the extracts; third, verify the structure\\(s) of the ligand\\(s). This method allows the direct structural identification of ligand\\(s) from medicinal plant extracts without separation and purification. Thus it provides a very promising strategy for the fast screening of lead components based on target recognition.",
