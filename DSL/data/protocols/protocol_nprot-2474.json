            "content": "Carotenoids are constituted of five joined isoprenoid units. These highly unsaturated and lipophilic molecules are very unstable, due to their susceptibility to isomerize and/or to oxidize rapidly during the analytical procedures. Thus, precautionary measures to avoid formation of artifacts and quantitative losses should be standard practice in the laboratory. Therefore, the major focus should be to complete the analysis within the shortest timing, to avoid reaction with oxygen and acids, to protect samples from light and high temperature. The use of high purity solvents that are free from harmful impurities is a strong recommendation \\(Rodriguez-Amaya, 2001). \r\n\n\nOxygen, especially in combination with light and heat, is highly destructive for carotenoid molecules. Exposure to sunlight and/or ultraviolet light induces trans/cis photoisomerization and photo-cleavage of carotenoids. Thus, the experimental work must be done under red light and/or in dark.\r\n\n\nThe frequent errors and drawbacks commonly associated with the extraction, identification and quantification of carotenoids are carefully pinpointed in the Procedures in the next section. To allow the reliability of the results, each analysis was performed in triplicate. More precisely, the following points should be considered: \r\n\n\n- The amount of extracted matrix must be representative of the biological material.\r\n\n\n- Before extraction, the matrix is stored at -80\u00b0C but not the extract which is very sensible to oxidation \\(when the extracted samples are thawed/frozen repeatedly).   \r\n\n\n- The efficiency of extraction should be complete \\(see Troubleshooting section).\r\n\n\n- The amount of loss during the different steps of extraction should be reduced by cautious handling of samples.  \r\n\n\n- The chromatographic separation must be adapted to the specific carotenoid distribution.\r\n\n\n- The mass spectrometry data and literature information should be combined to limit the failure of identification.\r\n\n\nIn parallel with this analytical procedure aimed to identify the repertoire of the carotenoid family, a direct molecular imaging is performed using the Raman imaging spectrometry and living animals without previous extraction. Although this does not allow us to identify specifically each isomer of the carotenoid repertoire, a global quantification can be done based on common molecular motifs generating specific Raman profiles. This procedure is non-destructive and allows researchers to visualize the molecules of interest in their cellular and/or organ context."

            "content": "**1) Mass spectrometry analysis.** \r\n\n\nThe \u03b2-carotene standard amount \\(Extrasynthese, cat n\u00b0 0303 S) is very low \\(~ 1 mg). To overcome these limitations, the concentration of the initial solution was determined by measuring its specific absorbance in hexane solution at 451 nm and using the extinction coefficient of \u03b2-carotene \\(\u03b51%) in hexane \\(= 2592). The successive dilutions of the initial solution were then prepared in hexane and injected into HPLC. The \u03b2-carotene chromatographic profiles were used to standardize the concentrations. The initial \u03b2-carotene solution was kept in amber vial under nitrogen atmosphere at -80\u00b0C for a maximum of one week. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP 1: For each carotenoid analysis, one gram of aphids was hand-milled using liquid nitrogen. Aphids were weighed before milling and then the resulting powder was carefully recovered. We notice that the water condensation on the aphid cuticle after defrosting tends to bias the weighing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP 2: Carotenoids are light sensible. Consequently all the extractions and standard solution preparations are performed under red-light. Furthermore, these compounds being easily oxidized, the extracts are injected immediately into HPLC column.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP 3: Carotenoid extracts dissolved in dichloromethane / \\[MTBE/methanol], v/v) \\(see below: Step S9) were not filtrated before HPLC analysis. The solvent mixture is extremely volatile and filtration would considerably reduce the volume of extract.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP 4: Carotenoids are also highly heat sensitive. The temperature along the full process and particularly the concentration step in the water bath should not exceed 40\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP 5: Carotenoids being easily oxidized particularly when extracted out of the matrix, we advice to keep these molecules under their native form in insects stored at -80\u00b0C instead of freezing the extract.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_GENERAL EXTRACTION AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE_.\r\n\n\nThe procedure was adapted from the article published by Taungbodhitham _et al._ \\(1998), Dhuique-Mayer _et al._ \\(2005) and Mertz _et al._ \\(2010). Each analysis was made in triplicate.\r\n\n\nThe major points of carotenoid analysis are the sampling and sample preparation, extraction, partition/solubilization in appropriate solvents depending on their polar/apolar properties, washing, evaporation of solvents, chromatographic separation, and finally at the end of this process, identification and quantification of the carotenoid compounds.\r\n\n\n_1\nst\nStep: extraction and solvent preparation_.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Prepare 15 mL of solvent A: ethanol \\(20 mL)/hexane \\(15 mL) containing 35 mg of BHT as antioxidant. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Prepare 80 mL of 10% sodium chloride.\r\n\n\n_2\nnd\nStep: extraction and purification steps_. This entire step was conducted under red light until transfer in an amber vial. Figure 1 presents the main steps of this procedure.\r\n\n\n\u2022 S1: weight 1 g of aphids \\(balance precision \u00b1 0.01 mg).\r\n\n\n\u2022 S2: carefully milled the aphids in a mortar pestle with liquid nitrogen \\(very low T\u00b0C breaks easily the cuticle of the insects). \r\n\n\n\u2022 S3: in a 50 mL beaker, add 15 mL of solvent A and 80 mg of MgCO3 to neutralize the acidity of the mixture and stir for 5 min.\r\n\n\n\u2022 S4: filtrate the mixture on a filter funnel n\u00b02 and wash the precipitate successively with 15 mL of solvent A, 15 mL of ethanol, then with 15 mL of hexane to recover most of lipophilic compounds. \r\n\n\n\u2022 S5: transfer the solvent mixture in a separatory funnel and washed:\r\n\n\no S5-1: once with 40 mL of 10% sodium chloride \\(salt enhances the ionic strength of the solution. The hydrophilic compounds are concentrated in the water phase). \r\n\n\no S5-2: twice with 40 mL of distilled water to rinse the eventual salty traces.\r\n\n\n\u2022 S6: recover the hexanic phase in a beaker. \r\n\n\n\u2022 S7: dry the phase with 1 g of sodium sulphate and filtrate on a cotton glass in a 100 mL conical ball. \r\n\n\n\u2022 S8: evaporate the dried organic phase using a rotavapor with a T\u00b0C of the water bath not exceeding 40\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\u2022 S9: the residue is recovered with 250 \u00b5L of dichloromethane and 250 \u00b5L of MTBE/methanol \\(80:20, v/v). These solvents being very volatile, it is important to pipette immediately in an amber vial.\r\n\n\n\u2022 S10: the extract is injected quickly on HPLC for analysis purpose.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_HPLC-MS ANALYSIS OF CAROTENOIDS_.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Carotenoids separation with a C30 column \\(250 X 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Gradient solvent program is presented Table 1. Injection volume: 10 \u00b5L, UV-vis. Detection: 250- 600 nm. Acetate ammonium \\(20 mM) was added in solvent A and B to favor ionization of the molecules in the ESI chamber.\r\n\n\n\u2022 In order to get simultaneously UV-visible and MS data, after passing through the flow cell of the diode array detector, the column eluate was split and 0.5 ml was directed to the ion trap of the LCQ mass spectrometer.\r\n\n\n\u2022 MS experiments in \\(+) ion mode, scan range: 100\u20132000 amu, scan rate: 1 scan/s and temperature for dissolving: 250 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY QUANTIFICATION OF CAROTENOIDS_.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Column and gradient conditions \\(Table 1, below) were the same as used in mass spectrometry analysis. Ammonium acetate was not added.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Injection volume: 20 \u00b5L, absorbance followed at 450 nm. \r\n\n\n\u2022  All carotenoids concentrations are expressed in \u03b2-carotene equivalent \\(standard solutions injected at 450 nm).\r\n\n\nThese data are summarized in figure 1.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2) Raman imaging spectrometry**.\r\n\n\nRaman spectrometry provides a fingerprint of molecules specific of its global structure and/or some of its motifs \\(Roman _et al._ \\(2010). The intensity of the peaks is proportional to the quantity of molecules which generate them and can be determined in cell context without destructive extraction process. Raman imaging spectrometry can be also used for a spatial visualization of molecules in tissue allowing the analysis of molecular dynamics. Briefly,  \u03c5\\(C=C) 1500 - 1900 cm-1 and \u03c5\\(C\u2245C) 2100 - 2250 cm-1  and \u03c5\\(C\u2212\u0397) 2800 - 3000 cm-1 give strong Raman signal. Three peaks specify carotenoid molecules in Raman analysis:  C-CH3 \\(1000 cm-1), C-C \\(1150 cm-1), C=C\\(1500 cm-1). Different ratios were determined: the ratio C-C/C=C; C=C \\(torulene/carotene); C-C / C=C;   C-CH3 / \u00bd \\(C-C + C=C; );   C-CH3/C-C  and C-CH3/C=C. Considering that the Raman peaks result from inelastic scattering involving vibrational levels of molecules, the baseline is related to radiative relaxation processes giving rise to fluorescence. The latter phenomenon strongly depends on the excitation wavelength and the interaction of molecules with its environment \\(Figure 3). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3) ATP dosage of individual aphid extract in a complex population**.\r\n\n\nThe dosage was conducted according to the recommendation of the company and is based on the visible light production obtained with an equal amount of protein in tested samples \\(Figure 4). \r\n\n\n  \r\n\n\n**4) Maintenance and propagation of aphids: selection of aphid variants synthesizing carotenoid molecules**.\r\n\n\nThe pea aphid _Acyrthosiphon pisum_ \\(Homoptera order, Aphididae family) are raised on the _Vicia faba_ plant. Aphids were maintained in cages in a Sayo incubator at about 22\u02daC \u00b1 3\u02daC and/or at 8\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C, humidity 60% and with a photoperiodicity of 16/8 hours light/dark. Three colored \r\n\n\nphenotypes are the orange, the white and the green. Basically the white phenotype emerged when the plants are declining and food resources are rare. The orange phenotype is dominant in optimal temperature and food resources. Finally the green phenotype was selected over 5 months by placing 10 orange  adults each day at 8\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C. The orange phenotype was not viable in these conditions \\(orange larvae died at the stage 3 or 4), but the selected green variant turned out to be robust at this temperature. Placing back the green variant at room temperature results in the fast fading of the green pigment in each individual and its disappearance in approximately two days \\(aphids become orange again).  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**REFERENCES**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDhuique-Mayer, C., Caris-Veyrat, C., Ollitraut, P., Curk, F., and Amiot, M.

A spectacular evolutionary achievement allowed the aphid to produce carotenoids obviously by lateral transfer of genes from fungi. We have recently documented that these molecules are involved in photo conditioning of metabolism such ATP synthesis in this insect model. The carotenoid synthesis in aphid was directly determined in living insects without extraction procedure by Raman imaging technique and the analysis was compared between insects raised in distinct environments. In contrast with the Raman spectrum that provides information on molecular motifs recognition \\(conjugated double bonds) but does not discriminate between isomers and ester forms, the mass spectrometry technology allowed us to analyze finely the variations in carotenoid composition. In parallel to these spectral analysis and chemistry determination, series of dosage of ATP were performed in order to correlate carotenoid synthesis and metabolism in aphid.",
