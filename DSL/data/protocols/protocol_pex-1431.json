            "content": "<p>EPS cells provide new tools to study the regulation of developmental potency<sup>1</sup>, which have promising applicative potentials in basic and translational research<sup>2, 3, 4, 5</sup>. Our recent study has shown that directed differentiation of human EPS cells can generate functional human hepatocytes<sup>6</sup>, which was achieved by pretreating human EPS cells before applying a hepatic differentiation protocol for conventional human pluripotent cells. This strategy could be generally applied to generate other lineages from human EPS cells by simply adapting differentiation protocols for conventional human pluripotent cells. The therapeutic translation of EPS cell-derived cell types requires xeno-free culturing of human EPS cells. We have established a chemically defined and xeno-free culture system that can support derivation and long-term stable propagation of human EPS cells in vitro.</p>"

            "content": "Preparation of stock solution\n1. Dissolve the reagents according to manual instructions. The concentrations of stock solutions and their final concentration in the medium are shown below:\nInsulin 10 mg/ml (final concentration 10 \u03bcg/ml), Apo-transferrin 55 mg/ml (final concentration 5.5 \u03bcg/ml), Sodium selenite 10 \u03bcg/ml (final concentration 1 ng/ml), L-Ascorbic acid 2-phosphate 50 mg/ml (final concentration 100 \u03bcg/ml), Activin A 100 \u03bcg/ml (final concentration 5-40 ng/ml), Human LIF 100 \u03bcg/ml (final concentration 10 ng/ml), CHIR99021 10 mM (final concentration 1 \u03bcM), (S)-(+)-Dimethindene maleate\n20 mM (final concentration 2 \u03bcM), Minocycline Hydrochloride 20 mM (final concentration 2 \u03bcM), Y-27632 100 mM (final concentration 5 \u03bcM), IWR-1-endo (optional) 5 mM (final concentration 0.5 \u03bcM).\n2. Store the cytokines in a refrigerator at - 80\u00b0C, except that insulin is stored at 4\u00b0C. Store other dissolved reagents in a refrigerator at - 20\u00b0C. Reagents are stored in small quantity to avoid repeated freezing and thawing. The thawed reagents can be stored at 4\u00b0C for no more than 2 weeks.\nPreparation of xeno-free human EPS cell medium\n1. Thaw packed stock solutions at room temperature.\n2. For preparing 50 ml xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium, add the reagents according to the information shown below:\nDMEM/F12 (liquid) 25 ml, Neurobasal (liquid) 25 ml, Insulin 50 \u03bcl, Apo-transferrin 5.5 \u03bcl, Sodium selenite\n5 \u03bcl, L-Ascorbic acid 2-phosphate 100 \u03bcl, Activin A 10 \u03bcl (20 ng/ml), Human LIF 5 \u03bcl, CHIR99021 5 \u03bcl, (S)-(+)-Dimethindene maleate 5 \u03bcl, Minocycline Hydrochloride 5 \u03bcl, Y-27632 2.5 \u03bcl, Ethanolamine (liquid) 2.5 \u03bcl, Catalase (liquid) 10 \u03bcl.\n3. Prepared xeno-free hEPS medium could be kept at 4\u00b0C for up to 1 week.\nPreparation of LN-521 coated plates\nThaw 1 vial of LN-521 (100 \u03bcg/ml) at 4\u00b0C. Prepare the LN-521 solution (1:40) in DPBS with calcium and magnesium. Add the solution into the wells (for a 24-well plate: 350 \u03bcl per well; for a 12-well plate: 700 \u03bcl per well). Incubate the coated plates 37\u00b0C for at least 2 hours. Alternatively, the coated plates could be placed at 4\u00b0C overnight. Do not allow the culture surface to dry as the matrix will become inactivated. The coated plates should be used as soon as possible and stored at 4\u00b0C for no more than one week.\nCulture and passaging of xeno-free human EPS cells\n1. Warm the xeno-free hEPS medium at room temperature and TrypLE Select at 37\u00b0C.\n2. Dilute TrypLE Select with DPBS with a 1:1 ratio. Keep the diluted TrypLE Select warm at 37\u00b0C.\n3. Change the culture medium every 2-3 days. To change the medium, remove the supernatant and add fresh xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium. Passage xeno-free human EPS cells every 3-4 days.\n4. Cell passaging is conducted when xeno-free human EPS cells reach 85%-95% of confluence. Wash xeno-free human EPS cells with DPBS without calcium and magnesium for once. After aspirating the DPBS solution, add 0.5X TrypLE Select solution (for a 12-well plate: about 500 \u03bcl per well) and incubate the cells at 37\u00b0C for 3 min in the incubator.\n5. Remove the 0.5X TrypLE Select solution and add xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium into the well (for a 12-well plate: 1 ml per well). Pipet the digested cells into single cells and centrifuge at room temperature. Aspirate the suspension and resuspend the cells using xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium.\n6. Remove the LN-521 solution from the LN-521 coated plate and add xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium (for a 12-well plate, 1 ml culturing medium). Seed the cells into the new wells at the density of 20,000-30,000 cells/cm\n2\n.\n7. Change the culturing medium the next day. When the density of the seeded cells exceeds 50,000 cells/cm2, the medium needs to be changed every day.\nAdaptation of feeder-cultured human EPS cells to xeno-free culture system\n1. Warm the medium and TrypLE Select at room temperature.\n2. Remove the supernatant of feeder-cultured human EPS cells, wash once with DPBS, dissociate the cells with 0.5X TrypLE Select.\n3. Centrifuge the cells and resuspend them with N2B27-LCDM medium (culturing medium for feeder cultured human EPS cells), and seed the cells onto the LN-521 coated plates at desired densities. The ratio is usually from 1:6 to 1:10.\n4. Replace the medium with xeno-free hEPS medium 24 hours later.\n5. For the first 3-5 passages, lower the split ratio (1:3) so that cell viability could be improved. The density of the seeded cells is about 40,000 cells/cm\n2\n. In addition, 1%-5% of xeno-free KSR is recommended to be added during the adaptation so that cell viability and proliferation could be improved.\n6. After 5-7 passages, the cells could proliferate well in xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium.\nDeriving xeno-free human EPS cells from Human fetal fibroblast (HFF)\n1. Perform sendai virus transduction (CytoTuneTM-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit ) according to the user\u2019s manual.\n2. 5-7 days post transduction, replate the infected HFFs onto LN-521 coated 6-well plates at the density of 1*10\n5\n/cm\n2\n.\n3. Replace the cultured medium with xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium plus 5% xeno-free KSR. Change the medium every 3 days.\n4. 14 days post transduction, human EPS cell-like colonies emerge. Picked up the colonies. Dissociate the colonies into single cell using TrypLE Select.\n5. After 4-7 days, colonies could be visually observed. After 3-5 passages, xeno-free human EPS cell lines can be stably maintained in xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium without KSR."

One prerequisite for the wide applications of EPS cells is the development of a xeno-free culture system for maintain these cells in vitro. Here we report a protocol for culturing and generating human EPS cells using a chemically defined and xeno-free culture system.</p>",
