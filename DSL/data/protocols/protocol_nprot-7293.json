            "content": "We developed a single-cell chromatin immunocleavage sequencing method \\(scChIC-seq) based on the principle of ChIC, which measures the epigenetic profiles at a single-cell level. In scChIC-seq, chromatin is cleaved at sites of histone modifications or TF binding by MNase that is recruited to specific chromatin regions by a specific antibody either through direct covalent conjugation with the antibody \\(Ab-MNase) or through protein A-antibody interaction \\(Ab+PA-MNase). The direct covalent conjugation between antibody and MNase eliminates the Ab and PA interaction step. On chromatin, MNase cleaves DNA around the nucleosome with the histone modification into small fragments. To minimize DNA loss in library preparation, both target and non-target DNA fragments are recovered and ligated to the adaptors. Since the targets are smaller fragments compared to non-target DNA, they are preferentially amplified by selective PCR conditions and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced on NGS platforms."
