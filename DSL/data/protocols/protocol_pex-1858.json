            "content": "<em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> is the most common bacterial species in resistant or recurrent infections due to its penetration in deep dentinal layers which is difficult to clean leading to endodontic treatment failures (Rathore et al., 2021). It compromises 6% of total flora in root canal and seen in 22_77% root canal retreatment cases as it has many virulence factors (Memon., 2020).</p><p>\t&nbsp;</p><p>\tSodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) which is the most common irrigant with excellent antibacterial and tissue dissolving &nbsp;and lubricating abilities, however it has several drawbacks as unpleasant taste,&nbsp;periapical irritation potential and &nbsp;low penetration depth into the dentinal tubules due to its high surface tension (Mohammadi et al .,2015).It has been found that its antimicrobial efficacy &nbsp;is affected by concentration, time of contact, volume and temperature .Heating of sodium hypochlorite &nbsp;increases its bactericidal action ,removal of organic debris and capacity of tissue dissolution (Shahiriari et al., 2017).</p><p>\t&nbsp;</p><p>\tExtra-canal heated sodium hypochlorite to temperatures of 40\u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, 60\u00b0C was first used in some studies but these studies found that preheating of sodium hypochlorite had a limited usefulness due to rapid equilibration to temperature between body temperature and room temperature (Woodmansey., 2005) .Landolo found that sodium hypochlorite stabilized in few seconds to the body temperature so the apical third of the canal was never able to reach 40\u00b0C (Landolo et al., 2017).</p><p>\tSo, other studies tried to heat Sodium hypochlorite inside the canal and found that Intracranial heating of sodium hypochlorite to temperature 180\u00b0C using Elements System B Heat Source improved its immediate tissue dissolution capacity as well as its effectiveness in &nbsp;removing organic debris and bactericidal action (Landolo .,2017, Iandolo et al .,2018). Intracanal heating&nbsp;gives temperature rise for 57 seconds so Landolo found that intracanal heating shows to be better than preheating&nbsp;in obtaining clean canal( Landolo et al .,2017, Iandolo et al .,2018).Rathore found that intracanal heating has better antimicrobial efficacy in comparison to extra-canal heating of sodium hypochlorite and at room temperature (Rathore et al.,2021).</p><p>\tThe use of ultrasonic devices and techniques in endodontic as passive ultrasonic irrigation &nbsp;(PUI) can improve the antibacterial and tissue dissolving properties of various root canal irrigant agents such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) by improving&nbsp;the exchange of substances in the canal, eliminates dentin debris and smear layer&nbsp;resulting in a greater &nbsp;cleaning effect (Mohammadi et al .,2015).A study found ultrasonic agitation of&nbsp;heated sodium hypochlorite improves the antibacterial efficacy (Yared and Al Asmar.,2020)</p><p>\tCryotreated &nbsp;NaOCl is found to be effective in reducing postoperative pain and &nbsp;edema ( Nandakumar and Nasim .,2020).One study found that &nbsp;Storage in refrigerated environment proved to be the best option to avoid the marked loss of active chlorine in sodium hypochlorite of concentration at 6% ( Braitt and Rodrigues .,2013) .The more the content of free chlorine&nbsp;means the more the antibacterial activity.</p><p>\t&nbsp;</p><p>\tSodium hypochlorite is strong antibacterial agent which is used at various temperatures, but up to date of this research, there are no studies assessing and comparing antibacterial efficacy of intracanal heated and cryo-treated sodium hypochlorite. So the aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the antibacterial efficacy against <em>E.faecalis</em> between intracanal heated, cryotreated sodium hypochlorite and sodium hypochlorite at room temperature with and without ultrasonic activation in single rooted teeth."

The canal will be filled with a sterile saline solution, H file will loosen biofilm bacteria by scraping the root canal walls for 15 s, and dentinal shavings from each canal will be collected using sterile paper points (40size). The paper point from each tooth will be placed in a test tube containing (1 ml of BHI broth).\nSamples in the transport medium (1 ml of BHI broth) will be dispersed with vortex in the mixer for 60 seconds by the laboratory technician. Serial 10-folds dilution will be prepared of 1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000 dilutions to assess the microbial load of\nE_faecalis\nin each root canal.50 \u03bcl of these diluted samples will be transferred and spread over BHI agar plates and cultured under aseptic conditions, followed by incubation at \u00a037\no\nC for 24 hours. (Gajan et al., 2009)\nEventually, the resultant growth will be visually quantified by counting the number of colony forming units per milliliter of each dilution (CFUs) on the agar medium using unaided eye \u00a0(Molander et al., 1998; Martinho et al., 2014). Only plates with 30-300 colonies will be counted. The number of CFUs/ml will be then transformed into actual counts based on the previously determined dilution factors.\nA second sample (S2) will be taken from each canal after implementing the investigated irrigation protocol. The number of CFUs will be determined as described for S1"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p><em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> is the most common bacterial species in resistant or recurrent infections due to its penetration in deep dentinal layers which is difficult to clean leading to endodontic treatment failures . It compromises 6% of total flora in root canal and seen in 22_77% root canal retreatment cases as it has many virulence factors .intracanal heating has better antimicrobial efficacy in comparison to extra-canal heating of sodium hypochlorite and at room temperature&nbsp;.Storage of sodium hypochlorite in refrigerated environment is proved to be the best option to avoid the marked loss of active chlorine in sodium hypochlorite of concentration at 6%.The more the content of free chlorine&nbsp;means the more the antibacterial activity.so intra canal heated sodium by system B at 180\u00b0C ,cryotreated sodium hypochlorite at 2_4 \u00b0C will be compared by sodium hypochlorite at room temp for thier antimicrobila efficacy againest E.faecalis</p><p><br></p>",
