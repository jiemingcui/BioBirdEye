            "content": "The development of organs and tissues depends on the differentiation of progenitor cells into mature functional cell populations. In the blood and immune system, hematopoietic stem cells \\(HSC) give rise to more than 10 different lineages, yet the \u2018structure\u2019 of hematopoiesis and the underlying pathways have remained enigmatic. One of the most direct methods for the in vivo identification of precursor-product relationships is genetic fate mapping \\(also termed lineage tracing). A heritable reporter gene is switched on in cells of a specific phenotype or stage, and this marker is perpetuated in all daughter cells from the initially marked cells. Lineage tracing is commonly done using fluorescent protein expression. However, numbers of distinct colors are limited. To achieve higher resolution, which would be required for tissue deconvolution in complex organs, we developed the _Polylox_ system, allowing genetic in-vivo-labeling of cells that is based on variable DNA recombinations. An artificial DNA cassette consisting of ten _loxP_ sites in alternating orientation and nine intervening DNA segments of known sequence are recombined upon transient Cre recombinase expression, with the DNA segments being inverted or excised depending on the orientation of the _loxP_ sites recognized by Cre. The DNA segments of the _Polylox_ locus are called \u20181\u2019-\u20189\u2019 in their original orientation and \u2018A\u2019-\u2018I\u2019 when inverted. The position and orientation of the segments translates into the so-called _Polylox_ barcode. While Cre is expressed, the shuffling of the _Polylox_ segments can progress repeatedly, offering a theoretical diversity of ~1.8 mio. codes and a practical diversity \\(we identified a locus that had undergone at least 6 subsequent recombination events) of more than 600 thousand different recombined barcodes. The barcodes are thus serving as cellular identifiers for high-resolution lineage tracing and are retrieved for analysis either by classical Sanger sequencing from individual cells, or from bulk populations by SMRT sequencing technology \\(Pacific Biosciences). For the determination of lineage relationships, barcode distributions between different cellular populations are compared, and correlation coefficients are calculated as indicators of lineage proximity.\r\n\n\nImportant considerations for the successful use of the _Polylox_ barcoding system are choice of Cre and calculation of barcode generation probability. A suitable Cre allele has to be inducible and tightly controlled for transient but not leaky expression. We have so far successfully tested two tamoxifen inducible Cre alleles, the _Rosa26<sup>CreERT2</sup>_ \\(_B6.129-Gt\\(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1\\(cre/ESR1)Tyj/J</sup>_) \u2028for ubiquitous labeling and _Tie2<sup>MerCreMer</sup>_ \\(_Tek<sup>tm1.1\\(icre/Esr1*)Hrr</sup>_) for barcode induction in hematopoietic stem cells. Second, _Polylox_ barcodes are not all generated with the same probability. Especially those that require only one recombination event are more likely to be generated than more complex barcodes for which multiple recombination steps are required. This protocol therefore also provides a method for calculating barcode generation probabilities."

Nine days after the day of the plug \\(day 0.5), treat pregnant mice by oral gavage with a single dose of 2.5 mg tamoxifen and 1.25 mg progesterone to induce barcoding in the developing embryos at E9.5. Tamoxifen stock solution is prepared by dissolving 1 g tamoxifen in 4 ml absolute ethanol and 36 ml peanut oil at 55 \u00b0C. Stock solution can be stored at -20 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. The pups are delivered on E20.5 by caesarean section and raised by foster mothers. \r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Genotype the pups for the _Tie2\nMCM\n_ allele at 3-4 weeks after birth on genomic DNA prepared from tail biopsies using primers #972, #984 and #HL14. PCR conditions are as follows: 2 min at 94 \u00b0C; \\(20 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at 62 \u00b0C, 1 min at 72 \u00b0C) 35 times; 5 min at 72 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Successful tamoxifen induction of _Rosa26\nPolylox/+\nTie2\nMCM/+\n_ mice is tested by PCR amplification of the _Polylox_ locus from genomic DNA of Ficoll-separated peripheral blood leukocytes. The _Polylox_ PCR is performed with the Expand Long Template PCR system using primers #2450 and #2427, annealing at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 anchor regions of the _Polylox_ cassette, respectively. PCR conditions are as follows: 5 min at 95 \u00b0C; \\(30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 56 \u00b0C, 5 min at 72 \u00b0C) repeat 35 times; 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. Separate PCR products by gel electrophoresis.\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_b) Adult mice_\r\n\n\n1. Prepare tamoxifen stock solution by dissolving 1 g tamoxifen in 4 ml absolute ethanol and 36 ml peanut oil at 55 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Adult _Rosa26\nPolylox/+\nTie2\nMCM/+\n_ mice are injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg tamoxifen on five consecutive days.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Successful tamoxifen induction of _Rosa26\nPolylox/+\nTie2\nMCM/+\n_ mice is tested by PCR amplification of the _Polylox_ locus as described above \\(Section Ia 5.)\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**II. Organ preparation**\r\n\n\nOn the day of analysis, mice are sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation. Peritoneal cells should be harvested by peritoneal lavage before any other abdominal organs are prepared. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_a) Peritoneal Cavity_\r\n\n\n1. Harvest peritoneal exudate cells by lavage of the peritoneal cavity for 5 times with 2 ml of 5% FACS buffer \\(DPBS with 5% vol/vol FBS).\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Small opening and gentle lavage with plastic Pasteur pipettes is helpful to avoid injury and blood cell contamination.\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_b) Spleen_\r\n\n\n1. Take out the spleen and cut the organ into small pieces in 5% FACS buffer using surgical scissors.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. To obtain a single cell suspension of splenocytes, the minced spleen is passed through a 40-\u03bcm filter using 5% FACS buffer and the plunger of a 5-ml syringe.\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_c) Bone Marrow_\r\n\n\n1. Prepare femora and tibiae \\(humerus, pelvis and vertebrae can also be included to maximize bone marrow recovery). \r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Bone marrow cells are either flushed from the long bones with 5% FACS buffer, or all bones are crashing in a mortar in 5% FACS buffer. \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Resuspend the extracted bone marrow cells by repeated pipetting and remove remaining bone pieces by filtering through a 40-\u03bcm mesh.\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**III. Purification of cells by FACS sorting**\r\n\n\n1. Determine the concentration of the cell suspensions, e.g. on an automated cell counter. This was done using Cellometer Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Block Fc receptors by incubation of the cells \\(5x10\n6\ncells/50 \u03bcl) for 15 min with 300 \u03bcg/ml whole mouse IgG. \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Add cocktails with titrated concentrations of fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies in 5% FACS buffer and stain the cells for 45 min in the dark on ice. Afterwards, wash cells in an appropriate amount of 5% FACS buffer.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. For dead cell exclusion e.g. add 100 nM SYTOX Blue at least 5 min before analysis.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Cell suspensions should be filtered directly to remove any cell clumps before being placed on the FACS sorter, e.g. by passing the suspension through the mash of a snap cap cell strainer. \r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Stained cells are analyzed on a FACSAriaIII cell sorter running BD FACSDiva software and populations of interest are sorted into 20% FACS collection buffer \\(DPBS containing 20% FBS). Alternatively, cells can directly be sorted into PCR buffer. \r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Aliquots of the sorted cells should be reanalyzed to determine sort purity. \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**IV. PCR amplification of the _**Polylox**_ locus**\r\n\n\n_a) From single cells via nested PCR_\r\n\n\n1. By FACS sorting individual cells are deposited into 8-tube PCR stripes containing in each well 25 \u03bcl of 1x PCR buffer supplemented with 12.6 \u03bcg Proteinase K.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Perform lysis for 1 h at 55 \u00b0C, terminate at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, and cool down to 4 \u00b0C before adding the remaining PCR reagents to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Amplification of the _Polylox_ cassette is done by nested PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR system: \r\n      - First round PCR: primer #2450 and primer #494 for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C; \\(30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 56 \u00b0C, 5 min at 72 \u00b0C) repeat 35 times; 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. \r\n\n\n    - Second round PCR: Use 1-2 \u03bcl of the first PCR reaction as template and amplify with primers #2426 and #2427 for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C; \\(30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 62 \u00b0C, 5 min at 72 \u00b0C) 35 times; 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. The nested PCR products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis for product length, and sent for Sanger sequencing \\(e.g. GATC Biotech).\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_b) Cell populations \\(10,000-50,000 cells) by direct PCR_\r\n\n\n1. Sort cells into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes containing 300 \u03bcl of 20% FACS buffer. \r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Use 2-5% of the sorted cells for reanalysis and harvest the remaining cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 g and 4 \u00baC. \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Turn the tube 180\u00b0 in the rotor and spin again for 5 min at 1500 g.\r\n   \r\n\n\n4. Carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend with 25 \u03bcl lysis buffer \\(1x PCR buffer 1 from the Expand Long Template PCR system in water and 12.6 \u03bcg Proteinase K). Digest at 55 \u00b0C for 1 hour and terminate the reaction at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. DNA can be at -20 \u00b0C, but the experiment should continued swiftly.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. PCR amplification of the _Polylox_ locus is as described above \\(Section Ia 5.)\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Visualize PCR products \\(one third of the PCR reaction) by gel electrophoresis.\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_c) Cell populations \\(>50,000 cells) via phenol-chloroform DNA extraction_\r\n\n\n1. Sort cells into 2 ml 20% FACS collection buffer and harvest the cell pellet by centrifuge at 400 g for 10 min after reanalysis for sort purity.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Carefully remove the supernatant leaving 50-100 \u03bcl of the supernatant to avoid disturbing of the cell pellet. \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Resuspend the pellet in 500 \u03bcl freshly prepared proteinase K-solution \\(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.3 M Na-acetate, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for at least 3 hours.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. From the lysate, purify genomic DNA by phenol-chloroform extraction. Briefly, extract once with an equal volume of a 1:1 mixture of phenol and chloroform. Then extract the aqueous phase at least twice with an equal volume of chloroform. Precipitate the DNA by adding 1/10 volume of Na-acetate \\(3M) pH 5 and 1 volume of isopropanol and 5-20 \u03bcg glycogen for 1 hour at \u201320 \u00b0C. Spin at 16000 g for 10 min and wash the DNA pellet twice with 75% ethanol. Dissolve the air-dried pellet in water. Measure DNA concentration.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. The _Polylox_ cassette is readily amplified from 100-200 ng of template DNA \\(representing 1.7 - 3.5 x10\n4\ncells) by PCR using the conditions described above \\(Section Ia 5.)\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. PCR products \\(one third of the PCR reaction) are observed by gel electrophoresis.\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**V. _**Polylox**_ Sequencing**\r\n\n\n_a) Sanger sequencing from single cells_\r\n\n\n_Polylox_ amplicons from single cells were sequenced by primer walking, using a commercial service \\(e.g. GATC biotech, Germany). PCR products were either purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, or DNA clean up was done by the provider of the sequencing service.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_b) SMRT sequencing from cell populations_\r\n\n\n1. Use the entire PCR product that is left after gel electrophoresis for an initial AMPure PB bead clean up step. Perform according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. For quality control determine DNA concentration by Qubit measurement and perform a Bioanalyzer run according to the manufacturers\u2019 protocols.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Continue library preparation for PacBio SMRT sequencing according to the \u201cAmplicon Template Preparation and Sequencing\u201d protocol released by the company.\r\n  http://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/Procedure-Checklist-Amplicon-Template-Preparation-and-Sequencing.pdf\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. Perform primer annealing and polymerase binding according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Load the library by Magbead mode \\(PacBio RS II) or diffusion mode \\(PacBio Sequel) for SMRT sequencing. We usually recorded for 4 hours. \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**VI. Barcode identification**\r\n\n\nThe SMRT sequencing yields data files with CCS reads.

Feyerabend, Jens R\u00f6ssler and Xi Wang contributed to this work equally.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis protocol describes methods for the generation of highly variable genetic markers in cells in vivo and the experimental and computational procedures for retrieving those barcodes from cells. The method is based on Cre-recombinase dependent _Polylox_ barcoding<sup>1</sup>. In cells or mice carrying the artificial _Polylox_ DNA recombination locus in their germline \\(_Rosa26<sup>Polylox</sup>_), Cre recombinase can induce DNA recombination in the _Polylox_ locus. The barcodes are retrieved by PCR amplification of the _Polylox_ locus from purified cell populations or from single cells, followed by long-range DNA sequencing of the barcode libraries. The recombined _Polylox_ sequences are computationally analyzed to yield barcodes. The generation probability of barcodes is computed to allow filtering for rare barcodes.",
