            "content": "The use of tissue staining to facilitate observation under the microscope began with Hematoxylin\u2013Eosin in the XIX century. \n\n\nHistoenzymology appeared in the early part of the century, a technique which consists of using the remains of un-fixed tissue, such as studies with DPNase and ATPase in muscle diseases. \n\n\nThe first immunohistochemistry was performed with fluorescent antibodies in fresh tissue, such as those used today in a range of skin and kidney diseases. \n\n\nBy contrast, immunoenzymatic methods \\(peroxidase, avidin-biotin) which permit amplification of the chromogen signal favoured the use of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Synthetic polymers are now used to amplify the signal \\(Envision, Powervision). \n\n\nImmunohistochemistry is essential for anatomopathological diagnosis of diseases, particularly neoplasms. \n\n\nFor immunohistochemistry to be completely useful, strict quality control standards, both internal - of the performing lab - and external, must be adhered to during tissue fixation, indications for use, reading and evaluation of results. \n\n\nImmunohistochemistry may be performed in tissue from both biopsy and autopsy, normally formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, as well as in cytologies. Fixation is essential since poor fixing means the result obtained is unreliable. \n\n\nImmunohistochemistry is a powerful diagnostic and investigative tool which provides information that complements routine morphological evaluation of tissue. The use of immunohistochemistry to study cellular markers that define specific phenotypes has provided valuable diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information on disease stage and biology. The use of antibodies for molecular study of tissue in the field of pathology has made it necessary to adapt and perfect immunohistochemistry assays, especially using fixed tissue. The history of immunohistochemistry has therefore been one of continual striving to improve the sensitivity of detection of rare antigenic targets with the ultimate goal of integrating tissue into the analysis. \n\nDue to the morphology provided by formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, this has become the method of choice for the majority of clinical and investigative studies. The method of staining antibodies with peroxidase was introduced in 1968 and was the first to be used in paraffin-embedded tissue. These pioneering studies using labelled enzymes instead of fluorescent colourings paved the way for the development of modern immunohistochemistry methods, such as automation.\n\nDepending on the type of sample to be studied by immunohistochemistry, this must be treated in order to ensure penetration by aqueous solutions, expose blocked epitopes and block all non-specific bindings, reagent groups etc. To do so, the sample is hydrated and heat-treated in EDTA buffers \\(ph8) \\(See section 5.7.1). Once antigenic retrieval has been performed, the sample is incubated with the primary specific antigen, then with the second and then retrieved in order to observe the presence or absence of the protein of interest."
