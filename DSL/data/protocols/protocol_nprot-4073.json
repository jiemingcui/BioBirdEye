            "content": "Inorganic polyphosphates \\(polyP) are linear polymers of orthophosphate residues found in almost all living cells including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, plants and animals<sup>1</sup>. The size of a polyP chain varies from three to several hundred phosphate residues which are linked together by energy rich phosphoanhydride bonds<sup>2</sup>. PolyP acts as phosphorus and energy store in microbes<sup>3</sup> and also performs many other cellular functions like formation of cell envelope<sup>3</sup>, membrane transport<sup>3</sup>, bacterial virulence<sup>4</sup>, biofilm formation<sup>4</sup>, quorum sensing<sup>4</sup>, microbial response in stressed conditions<sup>4</sup> and survival during stationary phase<sup>4</sup>. PolyP accumulation in microbes is enhanced during unfavourable growth conditions like nutrient limitation<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\n\nMany bacteria, algae and cyanobacteria sequester dissolved inorganic phosphates from wastewater as intracellular polyP granules<sup>5</sup>. Biomass harvesting of these microorganisms and their subsequent application as biofertilizers act as a substitute for inorganic phosphorus fertilizers used in Indian agriculture<sup>5</sup>. Quantification of the amount of polyP present in the microbial cells is necessary to identify the microorganisms with high polyP- accumulating capacity. Moreover, quantification of polyP is required to estimate the dose at which the dried biomass of the polyP- accumulating organisms \\(PAO) should be applied for crop growth to meet the standard recommended dose of inorganic fertilizers.\r\n\n\n In the protocol developed by Eixler _et al._<sup>6</sup>, boiling was used to extract polyP granules from the microbial cells but complete extraction of the granules could not be achieved for all types of cells. In this protocol, sonication of the microbial cells prior to the boiling step increases the efficiency of polyP granule extraction from the cells. In Eixler _et al._<sup>6</sup>, after boiling the cell debris were separated by filtration of the boiling extract and the filtrate was used for polyP detection. But for small- sized microorganisms, it is very difficult to separate the cell debris via filtration. Centrifugation of the boiled extract resulted in precipitation of the large chains of polyP residues with the cell debris and only the short chains of polyP residues remained in the supernatant, resulting in poor detection. To resolve this problem, a chloroform: isoamyl alcohol treatment step was added in this protocol. The boiling extract was mixed with 24:1 \\(v/v) chloroform: isoamyl alcohol solution and the mixture centrifuged to create two distinct phases. All the polyP residues were extracted in the aqueous supernatant phase which could be collected to quantify polyP spectrophotometrically using a specific dye, toluidine blue<sup>7</sup>. The dye shows maximum absorbance at 630 nm but when it reacts with polyP the absorbance decreases<sup>7</sup>.\r\n\n\n In this protocol, a chemically synthesized polyphosphate, sodium phosphate glass type 45 \\(Sigma Aldrich) was used to construct a standard curve of polyP. Different concentrations of the standard were reacted with an equal volume of toluidine blue solution and decrease in the absorbance with increasing polyP concentration was used to create a standard curve. The amount of polyP present in an unknown sample extracted from a microorganism was estimated by the trend analysis of its A<sub>630</sub> on the standard curve."

Weigh 0.3 mg of sodium phosphate glass type 45 and dissolve it in 150 \u00b5l de-ionized water to make a 2 \u00b5g/ \u00b5l standard stock solution.\r\n  2. Make 30 mg/ L toluidine blue stock solution with double distilled water.\r\n  3. Make 0.2 N acetic acid stock solution with glacial acetic acid and double distilled water.\r\n  4. Use 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 \u00b5l of the standard stock solution to obtain 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 \u00b5g polyphosphate in the experimental set up.\r\n  5. Make three replicates of each set up.\r\n  6. Set up the experiment in test tubes following Table 1.\nSee figure in Figures section.\n7. Vortex the contents of each test tube and incubate for 15 minutes at 25\u00b0C.\r\n  8. Record the absorbance at 630 nm, by setting de-ionized water as blank.\r\n  9. Prepare a standard curve of sodium polyphosphate glass type 45 in Microsoft Excel by plotting the amount of polyphosphate in the X-axis and the A\n630\nin the Y-axis \\(Figure 1).\r\n  _Microbial cell lysis for extracting polyphosphate granule_\r\n\n\n10. Take 5 ml of bacterial culture grown for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C in a medium with phosphorus source.\r\n  11. Take 10 ml of microalgal and cyanobacterial culture grown for 25 days at 28\u00b0C in BG-11 \\(non-N\n2\nfixer medium) and BG-0 \\(N\n2\nfixer medium).\r\n  12. Centrifuge the samples at 2,350 g for 5 minutes. Discard the supernatant.\r\n  13. Dissolve the cell pellets in 500 \u00b5l autoclaved de-ionized water and centrifuge at 2350 g for 5 minutes. Discard the supernatant.\r\n  14. Take the fresh weight of the samples.\r\n  15. Add 600 \u00b5l of de-ionized water to the samples and mix by flickering.\r\n  16. Sonicate the samples for 5 minutes at 30 Hz \\(Cycle 0.5, Amplitude 65%).\r\n  17. Place the tubes containing the samples in boiling water bath at 100\u00b0C and boil for 2 hours.\r\n  _Recovery of polyphosphate granules and quantification by spectrophotometer_\r\n\n\n18. After boiling, cool down the tubes at room temperature.\r\n  19. Add 600 \u00b5l of 24:1 \\(v/v) chloroform: isoamyl alcohol solution to all the tubes. Mix by vigorous shaking.\r\n  20. Centrifuge at 13,520 g for 15 minutes at room temperature.\r\n  21. Collect the upper aqueous phase in separate tubes.\r\n  CRITICAL STEP: Care should be taken to pipette the aqueous phase without disturbing the organic phase. The presence of even small amount of organic phase in the next steps may give ambiguous results. \r\n\n\n22. Take 300 \u00b5l of the aqueous phase in a fresh test tube. Add 3 ml each of toluidine blue solution \\(Stock conc. of 30 mg/ L) and 0.2 N acetic acid solution. Mix by gentle vortexing and incubate for 15 minutes at 25\u00b0C till the colour of the solution changes from blue to purple.\r\n  CRITICAL STEP: The change in colour implies that polyphosphate is successfully extracted and is present in the aqueous phase. No colour change indicates that extraction is unsuccessful and has to be done again.\r\n\n\n23. Make a control in the same way with 300 \u00b5l de-ionized water.\r\n  24. Record the absorbance at 630 nm, by setting de-ionized water as blank.\r\n  _Calculation of the amount of polyphosphate in the microbial cells_\r\n\n\n25. Calculate the amount of polyphosphate present in the samples by trend analysis of its A\n630\non the standard curve \\(Figure 1).\r\n  26. Calculate the amount of polyphosphate in \u00b5g present per gm of sample fresh weight by the following formula:\nSee figure in Figures section."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Inorganic polyphosphates are linear polymers of orthophosphate residues found in almost all living cells. Incomplete extraction of polyphosphates by different methods resulted in poor detection and incorrect quantification of the granules in the microbial cells. In the present protocol, an improvised method has been proposed to maximize polyphosphate extraction from different types of cells and quantify it spectrophotometrically. The time taken to carry out complete extraction and quantification of polyphosphate from a microbial sample might take around three and a half hours and the standard curve preparation might take approximately one hour.",
