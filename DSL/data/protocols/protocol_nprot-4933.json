            "content": "The classical two hybrid system \\(1) provides an easy means for mapping binary interactions in the global interactomes, screening for new interactors of a protein of interest and testing specific interactions. A major pitfall of this system is the significant probability of false positive and false negative results. These types of errors are especially abundant in the case of integral membrane proteins since their hydrophobic portions tend to demonstrate somewhat nonspecific binding to each other. A common usual way to overcome this problem is to employ protein fragments originated from extramembranous loops. The more complicated split-ubiquitin system was proposed for protein-protein interactions of transmembrane proteins \\(2). However, these approaches also have their own limitations, leading to large numbers of false positives and false negatives.\r\n\n\nHere we provide a guideline and a sample protocol to test for interaction partners of proteins that are natural residents of the inner nuclear membrane and contain at least one nucleoplasmic domain. Most importantly, in the case of these proteins, the full-length polypeptide chain, including intramenbrane segments, can be effectively used as \u201cbait\u201d for the search of protein partners.\r\n\n\nIn our opinion, this approach may produce more reliable data in comparison with that obtained using protein fragments as baits. We have demonstrated usefulness of the classical yeast two hybrid system for membrane proteins containing nucleoplasmic domains as exemplified by identification of protein partners of the BetaM protein \\(product of mammalian ATP1B4 gene), which is a natural inner nuclear membrane protein with N-terminus exposed into the intranuclear space \\(3)."

Inoculate 10 ml of YPAD medium with a single fresh AH109 colony and incubate overnight on a shaker at 30\u02daC. Dilute the overnight culture with fresh to OD600  of 0.15 and incubate with shaking for approximately 2 h until OD600 is around 0.7.\r\n  2. Pellet the cells at 2000 g for 5 min at room temperature, pour off or aspirate the medium, resuspend the cells in 10 ml LiAc buffer and centrifuge again. Resuspend the pellet in 500 \u03bcl LiAc.\r\n  4. To 50 \u03bcl of the suspension of yeast competent cells add 1-3 \u03bcg DNA plasmids harboring each of the two interactor partners \\(in GBKT7 and GADT7-RecAB), 300 \u03bcl sterile 40% w/v PEG-3350 solution in LiAc buffer, 25 \u03bcl salmon sperm DNA, and sterile water to 400 \u03bcl final volume. Gently mix and incubate at room temperature for 30 min. \r\n  5. Heat shock at 42\u02daC for 15 min.\r\n  6. Plate the shocked cells onto the SD -Trp, -Leu selective media and incubate for 2-3 days at 30\u02daC.\r\n  7. Streak several of the grown-up colonies of each cotransfromant on:\r\n  a) SD -LEU, -HIS, -TRP \\(low stringency plates)\r\n\n\nb) SD -Leu,-Trp plates supplemented with \u03b1-X-Gal \\(plate for growth-independent test for \u03b1-galactosidase)\r\n\n\nc) SD -Ade, -LEU, -HIS, -TRP supplemented with \u03b1-X-Gal \\(high stringency plates).\r\n\n\n8. Incubate the plates for 3 days at 30\u02daC and compare growth of your interactor pairs on media with different stringency. If the color of the colonies is ambiguous, incubate the plates at 15\u02daC for three more days and recheck."

Typically, both co-transformants should demonstrate good growth on \\(-Leu,-Trp) plates with blue color developed only in the case of the true-positive interaction. Ideally, there may be a significant difference in growth rate of the clones on the low stringency medium \\(-LEU, -HIS, -TRP). This is, however, quite rare in the case of membrane proteins, usually unspecific activation of the His gene leads to observable growth. Thus, the most important part is the growth on the high stringency medium \\(-Ade, -LEU, -HIS, -TRP, +\u03b1-X-gal). The test should be considered positive for a pair of proteins if the contransformant grows on all of the aforementioned media and produce blue color in the presence of \u03b1-X-gal, whereas the control pair shows no observable growths on the high stringency medium and no blue pigment."
