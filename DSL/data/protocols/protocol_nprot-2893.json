On the other hand, covalent binding is more sensitive, minimizes nonspecific binding and rapid. \\(1), and later \\(2), introduced an active functional group to an inert polystyrene surface by nitrating the aromatic ring of the polystyrene followed by the reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Alternatively, a functional group can be introduced onto a polystyrene surface by a grafting \\(3) or gaseous plasma technique \\(4). However, all the approaches are tedious and time consuming multistep procedures. Earlier, we have shown the activation of polystyrene surface by a rapid and simple method using 1-fluoro-2-nitro-4-azidobenzene \\(FNAB) in a photochemical reaction \\(6). Here, we report a rapid and simple method for a double-antibody sandwich \\(DAS) ELISA and a direct-antigen coating \\(DAC) ELISA by covalently immobilizing antigen or antibody onto the photoactivated polystyrene surface \\(7)."

The photoactivated plate gave more than a 2.5-fold increase in ELISA values compared to the untreated plate when 125 ng/ml of goat anti-rabbit IgG was used for immobilization.  As shown in fig. 1 and fig.2, goat anti-rabbit IgG immobilized on the photoactivated plate was found to detect as little as 62 ng/ml of rabbit IgG. The solid phases prepared by immobilizing capture biomolecule onto the photoactivated microtiter plates for 45 min gave better ELISA value than did the untreated plate. Moreover, solid phases prepared on the activated surface could detect even at a 1/50 \\(v/v) dilution whereas solid phases prepared on the untreated surface failed to do so. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 ELISA values which were about three folds higher were obtained with the activated plate compared to the untreated plate when analyte \\(Epicoccum nigrum antibody)  was diluted to 1/5 \\(v/v) \\(Fig. 3). As the solid phase prepared on the photoactivated surface can detect lower concentration of antibodies, it would be ideal for disease diagnosis, particularly to confirm false negative cases. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Unlike the activation of polystyrene microtiter plates by conventional time consuming multistep methods, the photoactivation method using FNAB is a single-step rapid procedure and can be carried out by relatively unskilled personnel. Because of the ease by which the photoactivated surface is prepared, ELISA applications could be a potentially powerful alternative to the simple passive adsorption technique. In brief, solid phases prepared on the photoactivated polystyrene surface permit more efficient ELISA procedures in terms of rapidity, sensitivity and reproducibility than do the untreated surface and make possible a range of diagnostic tests.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Amount of reagents used for ELISA is not final and can be changed according to the  need. In fact it requires less amount of reagents than used for conventional ELISA procedure."

Immobilization of Epicoccum nigrum antigen  or goat anti-rabbit IgG onto the photoactivated polystyrene microtiter plates was found to occur in only 45 min with higher binding than that obtained through adsorption during the same period onto the untreated surface. Nearly 1.5\u20132-folds higher readings were obtained when the ELISA was carried out with the solid phase prepared on the photoactivated surface rather than on the untreated surface. Moreover, solid phases prepared on the activated surface could detect IgE \\(E. nigrum antibody) even at 1/50 \\(v/v) dilutions, whereas a solid phase prepared on the untreated surface failed to do so. Around three times higher ELISA values were obtained in the activated plate than the untreated plate when IgE was diluted to 1/5 \\(v/v). Such photoactivated surface could be of great importance in diagnostic tests involving the ELISA technique particularly to confirm false negative cases.",
