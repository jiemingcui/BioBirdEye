            "content": "<p>With the advent of super-resolution microscopy, a plethora of fluorescence microscopy techniques have come into existence enabling nanoscale scale imaging to interrogate, understand and redefine the subcellular localization of macromolecules in biological systems. To date, single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques including direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (<em>d</em>STORM) have shown to reach lateral resolution of 10-25 nm (Kamiyama and Huang, 2012), a sufficient scale to directly visualize macromolecules in biological systems. Lately, these advanced fluorescent imaging techniques have been utilised to dissect membrane biology of prokaryotic systems (Xie et al., 2008). Model systems like <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Caulobacter cresentus </em>have been used to study the spatiotemporal organization of membrane proteins in bacteria (Gahlmann and Moerner, 2014).</p><p>Gram-negative bacteria have a double membrane system (inner and outer membrane) containing integral and peripheral proteins alongside with phospholipids and glycolipids. Outer membrane in particular, displays an asymmetric architecture in which the inner leaflet is comprised of phospholipids and the outer leaflet decorated with lipopolysaccharides&nbsp;(LPS). Majority of outer membrane proteins have a \u03b2-barrel architecture (De Geyter et al., 2016; Plummer and Fleming, 2016; Noinaj et al., 2017; Slusky, 2017) and they often serve as selective channels for small molecules to move across in or out of the outer membrane. Surface exposed domains in these channels provide means to fluorescently label and utilise them for fluorescent microscopy studies to investigate their spatial organization, which in turn provide insights to understand the surface distribution of membrane proteins in bacteria (Gibbs et&nbsp;al.,&nbsp;2004;&nbsp;Spector et&nbsp;al.,&nbsp;2010;&nbsp;Rassam et&nbsp;al., 2015).</p><p>Here, we describe a methodology to fluorescently label outer membrane proteins in <em>E.coli</em> to study their spatial organization using single-molecule localization imaging technique, <em>d</em>STORM. This protocol can be readily extended to study the spatiotemporal organization of other membrane proteins beyond gram-negative bacterial systems.&nbsp;</p>"

Collect aliquots\u00a0(500\u00a0\u00b5L)\u00a0of\u00a0cells\u00a0by centrifugation (4000 x g, 5 min, 4\u00b0C) and then wash twice in PBS before being resuspended in 500 \u00b5L of PBS. Coat the cover glass bottom chambers of 8-well plates (Sarstedt\u00ae) with 0.01% (v/v) poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae) for 10 min at room temperature and remove excess poly-L-lysine.\nNote\n- It is necessary to optimise the concentration of poly-L-lysine, as higher concentrations would result in multilayers of bacteria, which hinders Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging.\n3. Afterwards, immobilize 200 \u00b5L of\nE. coli\ncells in\u00a0to\u00a0each\u00a0coated\u00a0well\u00a0chamber.\u00a0To\u00a0ensure\u00a0the\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0monolayer\u00a0of\u00a0bacteria, centrifuge the chamber slides (4000 x g, 3 min, 4\u00a0\u00b0 C) and remove the excess cell suspension followed by three brief washes with PBS.\nNote\n- Ensuring the formation of a monolayer of bacteria is critical to perform TIRF imaging.\n4. Fix the monolayer of bacteria with a mixture of paraformaldehyde (2% w/v) and glutaraldehyde (0.2% v/v) in PBS for\u00a05\u00a0min\u00a0at\u00a04\u00b0C\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a0PBS\u00a0washing\u00a0steps\u00a0to\u00a0remove\u00a0excess\u00a0fixatives.\n5. To minimise auto-fluorescence caused by Schiff's bases in glutaraldehyde, treat the samples with freshly prepared 0.1% (w/v) NaBH\n4\ndissolved in PBS for 15 min,\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a0two\u00a0washing\u00a0steps\u00a0with\u00a0PBS.\n6. Where applicable the samples can be permeabilized either with Digitonin (0.001% or 0.01% w/v in PBS) or TritonX-100 (0.001% or 0.01% v/v in PBS) followed by three washing steps with PBS.\nNote\n- Depending on the localization of a particular protein in the cell, reagents for permeabilization may differ. For example, antibody accessibility to inner membrane environment can be increased by using TritonX-100, a much harsher detergent than digitonin.\nImmunofluorescent labelling of\nE.coli\nmembrane proteins\n1. The specificity of an antibody should be tested with a negative control.\nNote\n- In this instant, we have used a monoclonal antibody raised against E.coli membrane protein BamC. The absence of fluorescent signal on\n\u0394\nbamC\nE.coli\nmutants\u00a0confirms the specificity of anti-BamC antibody (Figure 1).\n2. Blocking of non-specific binding\u00a0sites is achieved by incubation in 5% w/v BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature,\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a0incubation\u00a0of\u00a0antisera\u00a0diluted\u00a0to\u00a01:1000\u00a0in\u00a05%\u00a0w/v\u00a0BSA\u00a0in\u00a0PBS,\u00a0for\u00a01\u00a0h\u00a0mixing\u00a0by\u00a0rotary\u00a0inversion\u00a0at\u00a0room\u00a0temperature.\n3. Remove excess ubound primary\u00a0antibodies\u00a0by washing the samples thrice with PBS followed by addition of secondary\u00a0anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 647\u00a0(ThermoFisher\u00ae)\u00a0conjugated\u00a0antibody\u00a0(diluted\u00a01:1000 in 5% BSA in PBS) for 45 min at room temperature. Follow the same washing steps to remove excess unbound secondary antibody. Store the samples at\u00a04\u00b0C in PBS prior to microscopy imaging.\nNote\n- Prior to imaging, a post fixation step can be carried out (with paraformaldehyde, 2% w/v) which ensures the preservation of antibodies in the sample for a long period of time.\n4. Prior to imaging add fiducial markers (TetraSpeck\u2122 Microspheres, 0.1 \u00b5m ; ThermoFisher T7279) to the sample.\nd\nSTORM image acquisition and processing\n1. Collect super-resolution\u00a0images\u00a0for\u00a0Alexa-647\u00a0labelled\u00a0samples\u00a0by\u00a0illuminating\u00a0continuously with 638 nm laser (1-5% laser power) at an appropriate TIRF angle.\nNote\n- When performing dSTROM imaging, take necessary steps to adhere to laser safety guidelines enlisted in your imaging facility.\n2. Drive dyes into the dark state (this takes about 30-60 s for Alexa-647, under 80-90% laser power), and then single molecule blinking time series can be captured. This can be under 10,000-20,000 frames at\u00a0an exposure time of 20 ms and an electron multiplying\u00a0gain of 50. Raw image pixel size with 100x objective and 1.6x magnifier engaged is 100\u00a0nm x 100 nm.\nNote\n- Laser illumination parameters may change depending on the miscrocopy system and the type of fluorophore in use. Therefore it is paramount to optimise these parameters before acquiring images.\n3. To reconstruct the series of to super-resolved images, an out-put pixel size of\n10 nm is recommended. For this we have used the open-source software rapidSTORM version 3.3.1 (Wolter et al., 2012).\nNote\n- You can also use other localization microscopy evaluation programs such as ThunderSTORM (https://zitmen.github.io/thunderstorm/) to achieve the desired resolution output.\n4. Here, we have set the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the fitting point spread function to 350\u00a0nm and fitted point spread functions (PSF) with a local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) < 120.\u00a0Images are first colour coded for temporal appearance of blinks to detect\u00a0sample\u00a0drift,\u00a0then\u00a0(if\u00a0applicable)\u00a0drift correction is acheived by\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0linear\u00a0drift\u00a0correction\u00a0available\u00a0in\u00a0rapidSTORM.\u00a0If fiducial markers are used, use the fiducial based drift correction option in rapidSTORM. Finally, export the file as\u00a08-bit\u00a0greyscale\u00a0images\u00a0for\u00a0further\u00a0image\u00a0processing.\n5. Extract the corresponding localisations files for the single-molecule images from\u00a0rapidSTORM software listing all detected localisations in x,y coordinates and use it for quantification and data\u00a0analysis.\nCluster analysis of Super resolution images\nCluster\u00a0analysis\u00a0procedure\u00a0can be found in\u00a0the following link at Git\u00a0repository; https://github.com/monashmicroimaging/autoclustr."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>In recent years Super-resolution microscopy has become an invaluable tool to noninvasively interrogate the membrane architecture of bacteria to study the spatial organization of proteins associated with membranes, which in turn help us to understand how bacteria have evolved to exploit environmental niches. Model systems like&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Caulobacter cresentus&nbsp;</em>have been used to study the spatiotemporal organization of membrane proteins. Like most gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane of <em>E.coli</em> is populated with \u03b2-barrel proteins, which serve as selective channels where exchange of small molecules take place. Surface exposed domains in these channels provide means to fluorescently label and utilise them for fluorescent microscopy studies to investigate their spatial organization at the outer membrane. Here, we describe a methodology to fluorescently label outer membrane proteins in&nbsp;<em>E.coli</em>&nbsp; and study their spatial organization using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (<em>d</em>STORM).</p>",
