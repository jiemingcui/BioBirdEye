A dataset \\(DNAorigami_3motors.txt) is provided for testing.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Fit the data by clicking the \"Fit\" button. Fittings are performed by a two-step numerical minimization of the objective function, obtained as a weighted sum of the negative log-likelihood plus the entropy. At the end of the analysis the Nmax for which the objective function is the minimum will be shown. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Save the results by clicking the \"Save output\" button, it will generate a *.txt file containing information on the parameters used and the results of the fitting.  \r\n\n\n\u2022 Simulate expected distribution of stoichiometries using the synthetic origami data to test the performance of the method as follows: \r\n\n\nLaunch the deco.m code. Set the \"Type of pdf\" \\(LogNormal or Exponential) you want to use, depending on the calibration data, and set the function parameters. Set N, the \"number of pdfs\" fn that compose your expected distribution. If \"only even components\" is checked, only the even functions \\(i.e. with n=2**k, with k=1, 2,..., floor\\(N/2)) will be considered. The calibration functions will be displayed in the plot on the bottom-left corner of the GUI. By clicking the \"Simulate\" button, a window will pop up, asking for the \"Number of samples\" to simulate and to input the values of the relative weights \\(wn) for the n pdfs to be simulated. By clicking OK, another window will pop up to choose the name and the path of the file to be saved. The file will be saved as **.txt, composed by a column of integers. Fit the simulated data using the deco.m code and compare the fitting results with the known distribution of monomers/dimers. The latter can be quantitate using some goodness of fit estimator. Make sure that the fit produces a reasonable estimation of your expected distribution. If the data are not satisfactorily fitted, try to increase the number of sample."
