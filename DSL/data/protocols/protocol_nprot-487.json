            "content": "Protein kinases are one of the largest families of the protein coding genes: constituting some 2% of the expressed proteins, regulate almost all biochemical pathways and phosphorylate up to 30% of the proteome. More than 400 human diseases have been linked, directly or indirectly, to protein kinases. Deregulated tyrosine kinases have been implicated in neoplastic development. Here, we describe biochemical procedures to monitor the activation of the tyrosine kinases \\(ABL, SRC, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and EGFR).  These kinases and its constitutively activated variants were expressed in mammalian cells and kinase activity was measured by tyrosine phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis.  We also describe the procedure for cellular transformation of BAF3 cells for IL-3 independent cell proliferation, and the development of leukemia in mice. The combination of these procedures is useful to evaluate the activating mutations in kinases and its potential to develop cancer. This protocol can be completed in 3-4 months."

Quickly thaw a vial of 293T cells by swirling in 37 \u00b0C water bath. \r\n  2. Spray vial with 70% ethanol and wipe dry before placing in tissue culture hood. \r\n  3. Gently add 1 ml 293T medium, mix with contents of cryovial and transfer into 15-ml conical tube containing 4 ml 293T medium. \r\n  4. Centrifuge the cells at 1200 rpm at room temperature for 5 min. \r\n  5. Discard the supernatant, resuspend the cells with 5 ml 293T medium into 50-ml conical tube. \r\n  6. Determine the number of 293T cells using a hemacytometer and adjust the concentration to 2x10\n5\ncells ml\n-1\n. \r\n  7. Transfer 3 ml of cell suspension \\(5 x10\n5\ncells) into a 60-mm dish. \r\n  8. Incubate the cells at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\novernight. Cells will be 60\u201370% confluent in 1\u20132 d. \r\n  9. Aspirate medium from 293T cells and replace with 10 ml fresh 293T medium. \r\n  10. For each 60 mm plate, add 6 \u03bcl FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, 90 \u03bcl of DMEM, and mix; incubate at room temperature for 5 min. \r\n  11. Add 1-2 \u03bcg retroviral vector, 1 \u03bcg of pCLECO plasmid. \r\n  12. Mix and incubate at room temperature for 15 min. \r\n  13. Add the transfection reagent: DNA complex to the cells in a dropwise manner. Swirl the dish to ensure distribution over the entire plate surface. \r\n  14. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nfor 48-72 h.\r\n  15.  Day 3: collect retrovirus-containing medium and pass through 0.45-mm filter unit. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Viral transduction of BAF3 cells**\r\n\n\n16. Plate 1 million BAF3 cells in each well of a 6 well plate using fresh BAF3 growth media with 5% WEHI conditioned medium as a source of exogenous IL-3. \r\n  17. Add 3 \u03bcl of 5mg ml-1 of protamine sulphate and 1 ml of filtered viral supernatant that usually has viral titer of 10\n6\n.\r\n  18.  Centrifuge at 2500 rpm for 90 min at 33\u00b0C in a Sorvall RT6000 table centrifuge.\r\n  19. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\n, for 24 h. \r\n  20.  Transduced cells are selected by addition of 3 microliters of 2.5 mg ml\n-1\npuromycin. \r\n  21. After 4-6 days, live cells were harvested by washing the cells with 10 ml of RPMI medium and used for further analysis.\r\n  Oncogenic transformation of BAF3 cells\r\n\n\n22. Five thousands transduced BAF3 cells were plated in quadruplicate in each well of 96 well plate in RPMI media containing only 10% IFBS. Cell growth in the absence of IL-3 is scored as oncogene mediated signaling complementation or cellular transformation. \r\n  23. Plates were incubated at at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\n, 14 days.\r\n  24. Plates were monitored everyday for cell survival and proliferation. Confluent wells were scored as transformed cells.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Tail vein injection and leukemia development**\r\n\n\n25. 10 million transformed cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 % BSA. Quantitate the number of cells present using a Coulter counter or a hemocytometer. \r\n  26. Centrifuge cells at 225g and 20 \u00b0C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant, and re-suspend the cells in PBS with 0.1% BSA at a concentration of 1 x 10\n7\ncells per ml.\r\n  27. Place the recipient BALB/c mice in the anesthesia chamber following the manufacturer's recommended settings.\r\n  28. After a mouse reaches sufficient anesthetic depth, remove it from the chamber and place it \\(ventral side down) in a properly sized nose cone, configured according to the manufacturer's recommended settings, with the dorsal side facing upwards. To confirm anesthetic depth, pinch the rear foot lightly. If no kicking response is present, continue with the procedure.\r\n  29. Agitate the cell suspension to prevent the cells from settling, and withdraw from the sterile tube into a 1-cc TB syringe with the needle removed. \r\n  30. Inject, with a 26 G needle, 0.1 ml of the cell suspension \\(1 x 10\n6\ncells) through tail vein.\r\n  31. Place the animal in a clean cage and observe for 10\u201315 min to ensure recovery from the anesthetic.\r\n  32. Monitor the mice for leukemia development and their survival.\r\n  33. Blood were withdrawn from each mice and analysed for cell count using blood smear slide.\r\n  **Extract preparation and western blotting**\r\n\n\n34. Harvest approximately 4-6 millions of either transfected 293T  or transduced BAF3 cells by centrifugation at 2000 RPM for 5 min.

Centrifuge the cell suspension and aspirate the PBS, and then resuspend in lysis buffer.\r\n  36.  Cell lysates are then homogenized and sonicate dofr 1 minute.
