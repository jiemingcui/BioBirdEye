            "content": "The largest mucosal surface in the body is in the gastrointestinal \\(GI) tract, a location that is heavily colonized by normally harmless microbes. A key mechanism required for maintaining a homeostatic balance between this microbial burden and the lymphocytes that densely populate the GI tract is the production and trans-epithelial transport of poly-reactive IgA1. Within the mucosal tissues, B cells respond to cytokines, sometimes in the absence of T cell help, undergo class switch recombination \\(CSR) of their Immunoglobulin \\(Ig) receptor to IgA, and differentiate to become plasma cells \\(PC)2. However, IgA-secreting PC likely have additional attributes that are needed for coping with the tremendous bacterial load in the GI tract. Here we describe a detailed method to characterize IgA+B220lowCD11clowiNOS+TNF\u03b1+ cells that we named TNF\u03b1-iNOS-producing \\(TiP)-PC in the lamina propria of mice by FACS."

Keep the intestine in a 50ml tube with wash intestine buffer \\(WIB) on ice, try to remove gentlyadditional tissue or fat.\n2. Flush gut with 10ml cold WIB using gavage needle.\n3. In petri dish with WIB remove remaining mesenteric tissue and fat with forceps, using light from a Rx projector.\n4. Locate remaining Peyer\u2019s patches \\(PPs). Excise by pinching PPs with forceps and cutting as close as possible with scissors.\n5. Use flat part of scissors to gently expel remaining mucus and feces.\n6. In new petri dish containing WIB open intestine along the length with scissors.\n7. Cut gut into small pieces \\(5mm) in to a 50ml conical tube with 20ml of cold WIB.\n8. Invert several times, vortexing and pour off supernantant. Refill tube and repeat 2 more times.\n9. Transfer gut pieces to 50ml falcon tubes containing 20ml pre warm \\(37\no\nC) intestinal EDTA buffer.\n10. Vortex and Incubate with shaking platform for 20 minutes at 37\no\nC\n11. Vortex tube on high for 15 seconds.\n12. Allow pieces to settle. Discard supernatant in waste \\(this supernantant contains intraepithelial lymphocytes).\n13. Add 20ml of intestinal EDTA buffer and repeat steps 10-12 at least twice until clear.\n14. Put pieces of tissue in a gauze and wash pieces with WIB twice. EDTA will inhibit collagenase so you must be sure to remove remaining EDTA beforeproceeding.\n15. Transfer pieces to 50ml falcon tubes containing 20ml digestion buffer and add 5mg of collagenase 4 \\(Sigma) and 0.5mg of DNaseI \\(Roche). CAUTION:Concentration of collagenase 4 can be variable even between lots. A titration should be done to determine the optimal concentration to use withoutimpacting cell viability.\n16. Incubate in water bath 1 hr at 37\no\nC. Vortex tube every 15 minutes \\(until the tissue disappear).\n17. Pour supernatant through 70um nylon filter in to 50ml tube.\nOnce LP cells are isolated, we proceed to do staining in four main steps: 1. viability staining, 2. surface marker staining, 3.fixation/permeabilization and 4. intracellular staining, as follows:\nCAUTION: You should use PBS only \\(without proteins) as a buffer during viability staining.\n1. Wash the cells with 5 ml of PBS\n2. Spin at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2\n4. Resuspend cells \\(1-10 million) in to 1ml of PBS\n5. Add 1ml of Aqua and mix well\n6. Incubate at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, protected from the light\n7. Add 1 ml of PBS to wash the cells\n8. Spin at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C\n9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 once\n- Surface staining\n10. Transfer cells into a 96 V well plate. Ensure that you divide cell suspensions into two wells \\(specific and isotype control staining) per sample.Also, you will need some wells for unstained control, Aqua staining only and fluorescence minus one \\(FMO) controls for IgA, B220 as well as CD11cstains. For some intra-cellular stains, isotype controls are \u201cstricter\u201d than FMO. These were used to gauge the level of TNF/iNOS staining.\n11. Add 50ml/well of the following surface antibody cocktail \\(prepare the cocktail in FACS Buffer):\nAntibody\nDilution\nrat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 \\(Fc Block Clone:2.4G2)\nHybridoma supernatant\n1/10\nCD11c PECy7\n1/100\nB220 EF450\n1/300\n12. Incubate at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, protected from the light\n13. Wash 2x in FACS Buffer, spin at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C\n-Fixation/permeabilization\n14. Resuspend cells in 100 ml/well Cytofix/Cytoperm\n15. Incubate for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C\n15. Wash 2x in 1x Perm/wash \\(diluted in water)\n-Intracellular staining\n16. Resuspend in 50 ml of intracellular staining cocktail \\(prepare the cocktail in Perm/wash buffer):\nCAUTION: Spin the cocktail 5000 rpm for 10 min before you use it.\nSpecific Staining\nDilution\nIsotype Staining\nDilution\nIgA FITC\n1/100\nN/A \\(FMO used)\n1/100\nNOS2 AF647\n1/25\nAF647 Mouse IgG1 Isotype\n1/25\nTNF PE\n1/400\nPE Rat IgG1 Isotype\n1/400\n17.

Acquire samples in a LSRII machine. We use BD Compensation beads for compensation as well as application settings to enhance reproducibilitybetween experiments."

As some of the polyclonal antibodies gave high background staining we recommend applying monoclonal antibodies. We have tested several of them, observing the cleanest signal with AF647 NOS2 \\(C-11), which is a monoclonal antibody. Although, the background with this antibody is lower, the background can be variable so it is important to include the isotype staining at the same time for each sample and subtract the background from the specific staining for analysis. \r\n  2. It is really important to titrate the iNOS antibodies used carefully even between lots as we have experienced differences. The shelf-life for the Ab is approximately 3 months.\r\n  3. Spinning the intracellular cocktail before you use it helps to minimize the background."

From this IgA+B220low cells about 3-5% are iNOS+ and 1% are iNOS+TNF+ double-positive, so you need to acquire at least 2 million of total lymphocytes in order to have enough cells to analyze."
