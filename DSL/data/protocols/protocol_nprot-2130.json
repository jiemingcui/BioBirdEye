Adjust to a suitable concentration, e.g. 4x10\n6\n/ml.\r\n  3. Anesthetize the mice with hypno/dormicum intraperitoneally or subcutaneously.\r\n  4. Mix on ice 1125\u00b5l Matrigel + 125\u00b5l tumour cells \\(i.e. 10X dilution).\r\n  5. Inject, subcutaneously, carefully 250\u00b5l ice-cold tumour cell/Matrigel solution using a 1ml syringe with a 0.6mm x 25mm needle \\(This will give 10\n5\ncancer cells per Matrigel plug if the original concentration was 4 x 10\n6\n/ml).\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Preparation of Matrigel samples for extracellular matrix cytokine detection and flow cytometry analysis:**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Note:** During the whole procedure, keep samples on ice as much as possible.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Sacrifice the mice\r\n  2. From each mouse, dissect carefully the Matrigel plug and transfer it into a 50ml tube with 1ml cell medium RPMI1640 supplemented with 0.3mg/ml DNase and 1mg/ml collagenase IV.\r\n  3. Cut the Matrigel plug in small pieces using sterile scissors. \r\n  4. Put sample on ice.\r\n  5. Clean dissection equipment and scissors between each mouse.\r\n  6. Go back to step two until all Matrigel plugs are collected. \r\n  7. Place the tubes in a water bath for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C.\r\n  8. After 30 minutes, place the samples on ice and keep them on ice as much as possible.\r\n  9. Mesh the Matrigel samples through a stainless-steel sieve onto the lid of a 5cm Petri dish, and transfer the solution with a pipette to a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube.\r\n  10. Clean and burn mesh, using 70% ethanol, between each Matrigel sample.\r\n  11. Centrifuge the tubes for 7 minutes 300g.\r\n  12. Remove the supernatant with a pipette and transfer to a clean 1.5ml Eppendorf tube.\r\n  13. Prepare the cell-pellet for flow analysis.\r\n  14. Filter the supernatant through a 0.45\u00b5m filter.\r\n  15. Aliquot the samples in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes \\(e.g. 50\u00b5l per tube). Freeze immediately at -70\u00b0 C or below and keep samples frozen until analysis with ELISA or luminex technology. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Note:** After incubation I _step 7_, you will still observe some Matrigel clumps in the sample. These clumps are easily meshed through the stainless sieve. After meshing \\(_step 9_) you will loose the rest of the Matrigel collagen fibers in centrifugation \\(_step 11_) and filtering \\(_step14_).\r\n\n\nCytokines in Matrigel extracellular matrix are diluted approximately five times in _step 2_ \\(1ml RPMI + ~250\u00b5l Matrigel plug). Final concentration is therefore found by multiplying observed concentration with 5.  A starting volume of 1ml RPMI + Matrigel plug will typically give 400-700\u00b5l filtered supernatant."

These air bubbles are very difficult to get rid of once inside the Matrigel solution in the syringe. Air bubbles in the syringe will give you an incorrect injection volume, and may cause the Matrigel to disintegrate once inside the mouse. \r\n\n\nc) We have experienced that if you thaw the Matrigel overnight at 4\u00b0C, it will be easier to handle.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n**Clogging of the needle:**\r\n\n\na) If the Matrigel/cell mixture reaches room temperature while inside the syringe, it will clog your needle. Keep the syringe and needle on ice before use.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Very low levels of cytokines:**\r\n\n\na) Cytokines are relatively unstable and generally have a short half-life. To prevent degradation of cytokines in your samples, keep samples on ice as much as possible during preparation. This reduces necrotic cell death and the subsequent release of proteases that may degrade the cytokines. \r\n\n\nb) Aliquot the samples before freezing to avoid a reduction in the level of cytokines due to repeated freezing and thawing.\r\n\n\nc) When samples are ready, freeze immediately at -70\u00b0C or below."

Cytokines are generally secreted in small amounts, and are relatively unstable. Therefore, detection and measurement of cytokine local concentrations in a tissue extracellular matrix can be challenging. To investigate cytokines involved in cancer prevention by tumour-specific CD4+ T cells, we have developed a strategy consisting of embedding subcutaneously injected tumour cells in a collagen gel \\(Matrigel) \\[1]. Matrigel is a soluble basement membrane isolated from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swan \\(EHS) tumour \\[2]. This extract resembles the complex extracellular environment found in many tissues. The Matrigel is liquid at 4\u00b0C but when incubated at room temperature, the Matrigel proteins self-assemble forming a gel plug. In short, the Matrigel functions as an extracellular matrix in which infiltrating immune cells \\[3] and secreted cytokines can be analyzed at various time points after s.c. injections \\[1].",
