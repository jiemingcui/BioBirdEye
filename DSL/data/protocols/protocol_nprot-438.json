Zymography using gelatin or casein substrate gels is also useful to monitor gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 or caseinolytic activity of MMP-3 and MMP-7 in each column fraction, although zymography is not suitable for calculation of purification fold and recovery of proteinases."

            "content": "**Collagenase assay for MMP-1** \r\n\n\n1. Mix a small amount of \\[\n14\nC]-labeled collagen \\(2\n3 ml) with unlabeled collagen in 3% \\(vol/vol) acetic acid \\(45 ml; 3 mg/ml) to make the count\n3000 c.p.m. in 50 \u03bcl.  \r\n  2. Dialyze the mixture against 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.02% \\(wt/vol) NaN\n3\nand then 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.02% \\(wt/vol) NaN\n3\nat 4\u02daC, and store the collagen at 4\u02daC.  \r\n  3. For collagen fibril assay, take 50 \u03bcl of the labeled collagen solution into 400 \u03bcl long centrifuge tubes \\(150 \u03bcg/tube), and incubate with 10 \u03bcl of each or combined fraction in TNC or TNC+B buffer, pH 7.5 \\(225 \u03bcl) in the presence or absence of 1 mM APMA \\(15 \u03bcl of 20 mM APMA) at 37\u00b0C \\(total volume of 300 \u03bcl).  \r\n  4. After incubation, spin the tubes at 10,000 g for 15 min using Beckman microcentrifuge and take 200 \u03bcl of the supernatant for counting using a scintillation counter.  \r\n  \u25b2CRITICAL  For the controls, add 250 \u03bcl of TNC or TNC+B buffer, pH 7.5 \\(blank), 10 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcg/ml trypsin and 240 \u03bcl of the buffer \\(negative control) or 10 \u03bcl of 4 mg/ml bacterial collagenase and 240 \u03bcl of the buffer \\(positive control) in the assay.  Activity is calculated as follows: \\(count of enzyme solution digestion \u2013 count of trypsin digestion) / \\(count of bacterial collagenase digestion \u2013 count of trypsin digestion) x 150 \u03bcg/min.  Although we have used \\[\n14\nC]-labeled collagen as a substrate, collagenase assays using FITC-labeled type I collagen \\(collagenase assay kit for collagenase, Chondrex, \"http://www.chondrex.com\":http://www.chondrex.com), fluorogenic peptide substrate \\(MMP-1 Substrate I, Fluorogenic, MERC, \"http://www.merckbioscience.com/\":http://www.merckbioscience.com/) or FRET substrate \\(SensoLyte Plus\u2122 520 MMP-1 assay kit, AnaSpec, \"http://www.anaspec.com\":http://www.anaspec.com) are commercially available and can be used to detect MMP-1 activity.    \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Gelatinase assay for MMP-2 and MMP-9**  \r\n\n\n1. Prepare heat-denatured gelatin by incubation of the \\[\n14\nC]-labeled collagen at 60\u02daC for ~30 min.  \r\n  2. Take 50 \u03bcg of the gelatin solution into 400 \u03bcl long centrifuge tubes, and incubate with enzyme solution in TNC or TNC+B buffer, pH 7.5 \\(135 \u03bcl) in the presence or absence of 1 mM APMA \\(15 \u03bcl of 20 mM APMA) at 37\u02daC \\(total volume of 200 \u03bcl).  \r\n  3. After incubation, add 100 \u03bcl of cold 45% \\(vol/vol) trichloroacetic acid.  Keep samples in ice for at least 10 min and spin at 10,000 g for 15 min.  \r\n  4. Take 100 \u03bcl of the supernatant for counting using a scintillation counter.  \r\n  \u25b2CRITICAL  As for controls, add 150 \u03bcl of TNC or TNC+B buffer, pH 7.5 \\(blank) or 10 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcg/ml trypsin and 140 \u03bcl of the buffer \\(positive control) in the assay.  Activity is calculated as follows: \\(count of enzyme solution digestion \u2013 count of blank) / \\(count of trypsin digestion \u2013 count of blank) x 150 \u03bcg/min.  Although we have used \\[14\nC\n]-labeled gelatin as a substrate, quenched fluorescent peptide substrate \\(EnzChek for gelatinases, Invitrogen, \"http://www.invitrogen.com/\":http://www.invitrogen.com/) is commercially available and can be used to detect MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Carboxymethylated transferrin \\(Cm-Tf) assay for MMP-3 and MMP-7** \r\n\n\n1. Reduce human transferrin \\(Tf) \\(20 mg) by incubation with 20 mM dithiothreitol in 20 ml of 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.6 containing 8 M urea for 4 h at 37\u02daC.  \r\n  2. Apply the reduced Tf to a column of Sephadex G-50 \\(\u03a6 2.5 cm x 20 cm) equilibrated in 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.6 containing 8 M urea at room temperature to remove dithiothreitol, and combine the void volume.  \r\n  3. Incubate the pooled sample with 1 mCi of \\[\n3\nH]iodoacetic acid for 30 min at 23\u02daC, and then with 30 mM iodoacetic acid for 30 min at 23\u02daC to complete carboxymethylation.  \r\n  4. After the reactions, add the same volume of cold 10% \\(vol/vol) trichloroacetic acid to the radiolabeled Tf and obtain the precipitate by centrifugation at 21,000 g for 5 min at 4\u02daC using a benchtop centrifuge.  Repeat this precipitation step three times.  \r\n  5. Dissolve the precipitate in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl at a concentration of 3 mg/ml.  Store the substrate at -20\u02daC in 1 ml portions. \r\n  6.  For the assay, take 10 \u03bcl of \\[\n3\nH]Cm-Tf into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and incubate with 10 \u03bcl of each or combined fraction in TNC or TNC+B buffer, pH 7.5 in the presence or absence of 1 mM APMA \\(10 \u03bcl of 3 mM APMA) at 37\u02daC \\(total volume of 30 \u03bcl).  After incubation, add 200 \u03bcl of cold 3.3% \\(vol/vol) trichloroacetic acid.  Keep samples at room temperature for 15 min and spin at 10,000 g for 5 min.  Take 100 \u03bcl of the supernatant for counting by a scintillation counter.  \r\n  \u25b2CRITICAL  As for controls, add 10 \u03bcl of TNC or TNC+B buffer, pH 7.5 \\(negative control) or 10 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcg/ml trypsin in TNC buffer, pH 7.5 \\(positive control) in the assay.  Activity is calculated as follows: \\(count of enzyme solution digestion \u2013 count of blank) / \\(count of trypsin digestion \u2013 count of blank) x 30 \u03bcg/min.  Although we have used \\[\n3\nH]-labeled Cm-Tf as a substrate, fluorogenic peptide substrates \\(Oncogene, \"http://www.apoptosis.com\":http://www.apoptosis.com or MERCK, \"http://www.merckbioscience.com\":http://www.merckbioscience.com) are commercially available and can be used to detect MMP-3 and MMP-7 activities.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Zymography**  \r\n\n\n1. Make SDS-PAGE gels \\(1 or 2 mm in thickness) containing 0.2% \\(wt/vol) gelatin or 0.1% \\(wt/vol) casein.  \r\n  2. Take 20\n40 \u00b5l of samples from column fractions, and incubate them with equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol for\n30 min at 37\u02daC.  Subject the samples to SDS-PAGE at 4\u02daC.  \r\n  3. After electrophoresis, wash the gels in 2.5% \\(vol/vol) Triton X-100 in TNC buffer, pH 7.5 for 15 min twice and then incubate in the incubation buffer at 37\u02daC for 12 - 24 h under shaking.  \r\n  4. After incubation, stain with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R and destain the gels.  \r\n  \u25b2CRITICAL  Rinsing the gels with 2.5% \\(vol/vol) Triton X in TNC buffer, pH 7.5 is necessary to remove SDS from the gels.  \r\n\n\n\u25b2CRITICAL  Activation of proMMPs with APMA is not necessary for zymography, since proMMPs are spontaneously activated during SDS-PAGE probably because of their conformational changes.  Proteolytic bands corresponding to proMMPs and active MMPs are seen as transparent bands within dark blue background.  \r\n\n\n\u25b2CRITICAL  Inhibitor studies can be done by adding appropriate inhibitors \\(e.g., 15 mM EDTA for MMPs, 2 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride for serine proteinases, 5 mM N-ethylamaleimide for cysteine proteinases and 0.5 mM pepstatin A for aspartic acid proteinases) into the incubation buffer during incubation of the gels."
