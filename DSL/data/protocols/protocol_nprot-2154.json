            "content": "For Lymph/Bile/Serum:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. For each new session:\r\n  \u2022 Prepare fresh acetone w/BHT, new internal STD \\(\uf061-tocopherol acetate, \u03b1-TA), new CM mixture \\(1:3) w/BHT.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Prepare each set of 13x100 and 16x100 test tubes with Teflon caps. Check the mouth of tubes.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Check the accuracy of automatic pipettes and syringes.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Wash the HPLC syringe for sample injection. First wash it with concentrated HCl, then with D.I. water, last with methanol to remove water.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Check windows to maintain the room temperature. This helps to keep the HPLC column condition constant.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Add 150 mg Na\n2\nSO\n4\ninto a 16x100 mm tube. Place the tube into a dessicator to avoid moisture.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Add 100 \u00b5L lymph/bile/serum with a 100 \u00b5L automatic pipette into the tube. Wash the pipette tip with 100 \u00b5L D.I. water. \r\n  Critical step \\(be accurate)\\!\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. Add 2 mL acetone into the tube with a 5mL dispenser. Vortex vigorously 3 times to denature protein.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Add 500 \u00b5L internal standard solution into the tube with a 500 \u00b5L syringe. Vortex the tube vigorously 3 times. Stand 1-2 h for extraction.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Centrifuge the tube 20 minutes to precipitate Na\n2\nSO\n4\n.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Prepare another set of 13x100 mm test tubes. Check the tube mouth carefully. Wash with CM mixture.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. Use a pasteur pipette to transfer the supernatant into a syringe connected to a 0.45 \u00b5m filter. Filter slowly. Wash the tube with 1.5 mL acetone twice. Transfer the washings into the syringe and filter again.\r\n  \r\n\n\n9. Evaporate the mixture under a gentle stream of N\n2\nat 40 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n10. Cap the dry tube and put it in ice for 1-2 minutes. Place the CM mixture \\(1:3 with BHT) flask in ice also.\r\n  \r\n\n\n11. Use a 500 \u00b5L syringe to add 500 \u00b5L CM mixture \\(3:1) into the tube. Vortex the tube 3 times. Wrap the tube with PTFE tape. Place the tube into the freezer to stand for 1-2 hours.\r\n  The sample should be injected at the day of preparation since aTP reduces at 8%/day. However, if the samples are placed in the freezer, it will be OK.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n12. Inject 50 \u00b5L final solution into the HPLC system and run 6.5 minutes. Degased HPLC grade methanol was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Detection was monitored at 292 nm. Characteristic retention times were 4.1 min for \u03b1-tocopherol and 5.3 min for \u03b1-tocopherol acetate. The linear range of the \u03b1TP standard curve was from 50 to 500 ng \\(r = 0.999). \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor tissues \\(except adipose tissues):\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. For each new session:\r\n  \u2022 Prepare fresh acetone w/BHT, new internal STD \\(\u03b1-tocopherol acetate, \u03b1TA), new CM mixture \\(1:3) w/BHT.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Wash grinding vessels and pestles with detergent, D.I. water, and CM mixture.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Prepare 2 sets of 16x100 test tubes with Teflon caps. Check the mouth of tubes.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Check the accuracy of syringes.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Wash the HPLC syringe for sample injection. First wash it with concentrated HCl, D.I. water, then methanol to remove water.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Check windows to maintain the room temperature. This helps to keep the HPLC column condition constant.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Weigh a 5 mL grinding vessel of a pestle tissue grinder \\(around 15 g), use a spatula to add some minced liver into the tube, weigh again, and write down the data. Add 2mL acetone w/BHT into the vessel. Place the vessel into ice.\r\n  Before weighing, the tissue needs to be homogenized by a spatula.\r\n\n\nIt is very important to get accurate weighing data. Place the grinding vessel in the right place and balance it to avoid drifting when reading. When using a small volume grinding vessel, such as a 5 mL one, no drifting occurs.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Add proper amount of internal standard solution into the grinding vessel before homogenization.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Attached a Teflon pestle to a grinding motor and move the pestle up and down in the grinding vessel for 1.5 min in ice.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Use a Pasteur pipette to transfer the first extract into a 16x100 mm test tube. Place the tube in ice.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Wash the grinding vessel with 2 mL acetone w/BHT. Move the pestle up and down in the grinding vessel for 1.5 min. Use the Pasteur pipette to transfer the second extract into the tube. \r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Repeat step 5 twice. Collect the washings in the tube. Centrifuge the tube for 20 minutes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. Use a Pasteur pipette to transfer the supernatant into another 16x100 mm test tube through a syringe connected to a 0.45 \u00b5m filter. Filter slowly. Wash the original tube with 1.5 mL acetone twice. Transfer the washings into the syringe and filter again.\r\n  Don\u2019t wash the tube if HPLC is clogged by the sample injection. Sometimes the filter does not work well enough.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n9. Evaporate the mixture under a gentle stream of N2 at 40 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n10. Cap the dry tube and put it in ice for 1-2 minutes. Place the CM mixture \\(3:1 with BHT) flask in ice also.\r\n  \r\n\n\n11. Use a 500 \u00b5L syringe to add 300 \u00b5L CM mixture \\(1:3) into the tube. Vortex the tube 3 times. Wrap the tube with PTFE tape. Place the tube into the freezer to stand for 1-2 hours.\r\n  Sometimes CM \\(2:1) is needed to dissolve all the lipids stuff.\r\n\n\nThe sample should be injected at the day of preparation since aTP reduces at 8%/day. However, if the samples are placed in the freezer, it will be OK.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n12. Inject 50 \u00b5L final solution into a HPLC system with a C-18 reverse-phase column and run 6.5 minutes. Degased HPLC grade methanol was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Detection was monitored at 292 nm. Characteristic retention times were 4.1 min for \u03b1-tocopherol and 5.3 min for \u03b1-tocopherol acetate. The linear range of the \u03b1TP standard curve was from 50 to 500 ng \\(r = 0.999). \r\n  Use specific column for specific method to avoid potential interactions\\!\r\n\n\nFirst run should be 60 minutes to check if there is any unknown peak at around 30 minutes. This peak will affect the next injection if it is not eluted.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n13. Typical applications for different tissues:\nSee figure in Figures section.\nFor adipose tissues:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Use a syringe to add certain amount of total lipid extracts into a 13x100 mm test tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Use a syringe to add proper amount of internal standard solution into the tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Evaporate the mixture under a gentle stream of N\n2\nat 40 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Cap the dry tube and put it in ice for 1-2 minutes. Place the CM mixture \\(2:1 with BHT) flask in ice also.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Use a syringe to add proper amount of CM mixture \\(2:1) into the tube. Vortex the tube 3 times. Wrap the tube with PTFE tape. Place the tube into the freezer to stand for 1-2 hours.\r\n  The sample should be injected at the day of preparation since aTP reduces at 8%/day. However, if the samples are placed in the freezer, it will be OK.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6. Inject 50 \u00b5L final solution into the HPLC system and run 6.5 minutes. Degased HPLC grade methanol was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Detection was monitored at 292 nm. Characteristic retention times were 4.1 min for \u03b1-tocopherol and 5.3 min for \u03b1-tocopherol acetate. The linear range of the \u03b1TP standard curve was from 50 to 500 ng \\(r = 0.999)."
