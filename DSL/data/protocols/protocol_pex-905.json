            "content": "<p>\tAdvancements in technology have allowed researchers to preform large-scale transcriptomic studies at the level of a single-cell. Droplet-based cell isolation has become a favorite in the field for its scalability and simplicity of use with either in-house fluidic set-ups<sup>1,2</sup>, or commercially available equipment (10x Genomics)<sup>3</sup>. This technique is particularly interesting for tissues with highly heterogeneous cellular compositions like intestine<sup>4</sup>, lung<sup>5</sup>, spinal cord<sup>6</sup>, and brain<sup>7,8</sup>. There has been particular interest in deconvoluting brain architecture and function, which at its base, starts by accurately identifying all the cells types present<sup>9-11</sup>. However, truly harnessing the power of individual cellular transcriptomes comes with assessing differences between those transcriptomes in different physiological states. This is of particular value for complex diseases where multiple genes contribute with additive effects, making it difficult to identify changes in tissues homogenates<sup>12</sup>. The chemical dissociation of tightly interconnected brain cells and other cell-types has been found to alter transcription profiles<sup>13,14</sup>. Given that nuclear transcriptomes closely reflect the cell\u2019s cytosolic profile<sup>15,16</sup>, isolating the nuclei from brain tissue has proven to be an excellent strategy for single-cell level studies. &nbsp;Likewise, other tissues that have either been frozen for long term storage or that are formed by syncytium, such as in skeletal muscles<sup>17,18</sup>, could benefit from this approach.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Development of the Protocol</u></p><p>\tNumerous protocols for isolating nuclei from brain cells have been published; some rely on the additional purification by fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS)<sup>19</sup>, which is costly and not readily available for all researchers, while others have made adjustments to the microfluidics component<sup>10</sup>, which can also be a limiting to many labs. Our protocol has been developed for use with the commercially available Chromium\u2122 Single Cell Controller. This is a highly optimized system that allows scalable single-cell capture. We have adapted our protocol to allow the system to efficiently capture nuclei from archived tissue. Our preparation produces stable and easily quantifiable nuclear suspension even when using archived tissue. We have used this approach to successfully compare the gene expression differences in the post-mortem prefrontal cortex of depressed patients who died by suicide compared to psychiatrically healthy controls<sup>20</sup>. The protocol has also been successfully applied to collect single-nucleus transcriptomic data from surgical samples of glioblastoma<sup>21</sup>.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Overview of the procedure</u></p><p>\tThe experimental workflow (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>) begins with dounce-homogenization in low concentration detergent for cellular lysis. Integral to the protocol are numerous wash steps to reduce ambient nucleic acid contamination. Determination of the nuclei numbers and concentration are assessed by a cell counter or hemocytometer. The concentration of the nuclei suspension is important to reduce aggregation, particularly in tissues that have undergone long-term storage and are thus more likely to be damaged, fragile and inclined to aggregate. &nbsp;</p><p><u>Comparison with other methods</u></p><p>\tAs previously mentioned, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) protocols exist using FACs which is harder to scale, as well as droplet based protocols which use in house set-ups. Early protocols used relatively fresh frozen tissue, which is not available from most tissue banks where samples are likely to have undergone long term storage<sup>9-11</sup>. Moreover, when studying specific phenotypes for which it is hard to obtain tissues, it is not always possible to select for short post-mortem intervals (PMIs) and archival times. Early protocols were also limitedly applied to the high-quality tissue which may not be an option for answering certain types of research questions. </p><p>\tAs with several more recently published potocols<sup>22-24</sup>, we have been able to adapt our nuclear prep to be compatible with a 10X Chromium system which is more likely to be available as a service platform. Furthermore, the wet-lab aspect of the protocol will produce nuclei suitable for multiple post-nuclei capture application such as, whole genome sequencing for the study of somatic mutations or <u>A</u>ssay for <u>T</u>ransposase-<u>A</u>ccessible <u>C</u>hromatin (ATAC-seq) as supported by preliminary results from our lab. </p><p>\tEach of the more recently developed protocols have their own strengths and weaknesses and, in some cases, adaptations for specific tissue types such as macro-dissections for white matter regions<sup>24</sup>. The strength of our protocol is that it is effective and mostly unaffected by variations in PMI or archival times of the samples <strong>(Fig 2)</strong>. Some of these protocols also incorporate ultra-centrifugation<sup>25</sup>, which is time consuming and requires specialized equipment. We are able to circumvent the additional challenges that arise with archived tissue such as, the fragility of the cells and organelles upon thawing which typically results in large amounts of debris and ambient RNA than can either, interfere with droplet formation, or be integrated into droplet increasing background sequencing noise.&nbsp;Here, we show that brain tissue which has been stored at -80<sup>o</sup>C for as long as 25 years, can produce high quality single-nuclei suspensions.</p><p>\tDirectly applying either the cell preparation protocol or the demonstration protocol for nuclei developed from 10x Genomics did not produce useable results (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>) , but is effective for samples from cell culture. The modifications made here are primarily for use with post-mortem tissue that has been archived for long periods of time but can also be applied to any post mortem frozen sample. Similar to previous studies<sup>10,11</sup>, we did apply a few modifications to the standard&nbsp;bioinformatic analysis to addresses a number of issues which arise with droplet-bases single-nucleus sequencing. First, we assembled a pre-mRNA reference to account for unprocessed transcripts found in the nucleus<sup>26</sup>. Second, given that previous studies have consistently shown fewer identifiable transcripts in glial cells<sup>10,11</sup> we performed &nbsp;customized barcode filtering to include cells with a wider range of UMIs but removed noise. With these minor modifications to the analysis our wet lab approach produced much improved data compared to the demonstration protocol from 10X Genomics.</p><p><u>Experimental design</u></p><p>The most important factors to take into consideration while designing single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-seq experiments is the potential batch effects. Given that the Chromium system only allows for the capture of 8 samples at a time and that for many experiments that total number of samples to be analyzed may be greater than eight, it may be preferable to create a balanced experimental design if possible. This will help limit the effects of batch to batch variability. For example, if two phenotypic or treatment groups are to be compared, it would be ideal to include equal numbers of samples from each group in every batch. Moreover, other potential co-variates to take into consideration include age, PMI, and sex. It may be possible to account for the effects of these variables by matching samples by these parameters within each batch. &nbsp;</p><p>In cases where cell-type specific gene-expression data has been previously published, or single-cell or nucleus gene expression datasets are available, these data can be used for comparison to help determine whether that cell-types identified, and single-nucleus transcriptomic profiles detected reflect, previously published literature. In cases where such datasets are not available it may be informative to prepare bulk samples in parallel or to perform sequencing for fluorescence assisted nuclei sorting (FANS) purified populations of expected cell-types based on known markers to validate the cell-type identification from the single-nucleus transcriptomic data<sup>27</sup>. High-throughput <em>in situ</em> hybridization (ISH)<sup>28</sup> and ISH based nuclei sorting<sup>27</sup> have also been used to confirm experimentally determined cell-types from snRNA-seq. In the case of complex tissues, it can be useful to perform careful dissection and even to cryosection the tissue before preparing nuclei to ensure that the approximate cell-type composition for each sample will be comparable<sup>11,24</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another strategy which has been recently applied to increase cost-effectiveness as well as to aid in batch effect correction is combining male and female samples in a single capture followed by using the expression of sex-specific, X-chromosome genes such as <em>XIST</em> and Y-chromosome genes such as <em>SRY</em><sup>29,30</sup><em>, </em>or the chromosome accessibility ratios for sex-chromosome versus autosomes<sup>31</sup><em> </em>to separate the cells from each sample. Since both samples are captured on the same lane of the microfluidic chip, it may be possible to account for lane to lane variability using this approach. Moreover, the use of cryosections of histological grade tissue blocks may be a good strategy for accounting for uniform input from a micro-anatomicallly heterogeneous region such as the cerebral cortex<sup>11,23</sup>. </p><p><u>Expertise needed to implement the protocol</u></p><p>This protocol requires access to a 10X Genomics\u2019 Chromium system and corresponding reagents or an in-house droplet based single-nucleus sequencing system. A hemocytometer or cell-counting microscope will be required for determining proper loading concentration. Wet-lab work will require familiarity with standard molecular biology approaches such as cDNA synthesis, and sequencing library preparation. </p><p><u>Advantages and Limitations</u></p><p>We are unable to get information about cytoplasmic transcription. Some tissue types may require additional processing such as FACS. Representation of all cell types may not be uniform as different cell types are differentially susceptible to lysis during the isolation procedure.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

Gently pipette 8-10 times or until nuclei are resuspended.\n19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a quick estimate of nuclei concentration, mix 10 \u03bcL of the nuclei suspension with 10 \u03bcL of Trypan blue in a separate tube. Load 10 \u03bcL of the mixture onto a Countess hemocytometer slide. Count nuclei on the Countess hemocytometer and measure range of sizes. For human neurons the average diameter of the nuclei should be around 10 \u03bcm. Trypan blue is a live dead stain and properly isolated nuclei should have be marked as dead cells.\n20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using the estimated count from the Countess dilute cells to around 500,000 cells/ mL or 500 cells/ \u03bcL by adding an appropriate volume of nuclei wash buffer. It may be possible to increase these concentrations for capturing more nuclei.\nCRITICAL: If the concentration of nuclei is too high it can result in aggregation which will prevent efficient capture of single nuclei in subsequent steps.\n21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add Hoechst stain to the resuspended nuclei at a 1:2000 dilution.\nNuclei concentration assessment and capture (Timing 45 mins)\nImmediately prior to loading the Hoechst stained nuclei on the Chromium system, check to make sure the nuclei are well segregated (nuclei may clump) and recheck sample concentration using a fluorescent microscope like the Evos FL Auto (Thermofisher)\n22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OPTIONAL: Use a 1mL pipette to take a minimum of 200 \u03bcL of the sample and filter it through a 40\u03bcm Flowmi pipette tip filter before counting and loading.\u00a0This will get rid of the clumped nuclei and large debris that can clog the microfluidics of Chromium chips.\n23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Load 10\u03bcL of sample onto a disposable hemocytometer slide and into the Evos.\nCRITICAL: Make sure to pipette the full volume of the nuclei suspension several times before loading for accurate counts.\n24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Set the Evos to 10X magnification and image the entire hemocytometer grid field of view in DAPI and bright field.\u00a0This image makes counting nuclei easier and serves as a record as well (\nFig. 3g\n).\n25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In parallel to steps 22-24, make the RT Master Mix and\naliquot appropriate volumes of master mix and water into PCR tubes according to the number of nuclei to be targeted for capture, referring to the Chromium protocol CG00052 Rev. D or later.\n?TROUBLESHOOTING\nCRITICAL: The Chromium capture rate for nuclei from archived tissue is lower (~20% less) than the capture rate for cells. To account for this, it is necessary to adjust the count used to determine loading volume. We empirically determined that choosing the loading volume by using a count that is 30% less than observed count worked best for our samples. This adjustment may vary from tissue type to tissue type. For example, if the sample has a concentration of 500 nuclei/\u03bcL, the sample volume should be loaded as if it has 350 cells/\u03bcL (70% of 500 cells) in order to get the targeted nuclei to recover.\nCRITICAL: Resuspend nuclei by pipette mixing the full volume several times immediately before loading to prevent aggregation of nuclei.\n26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Load the Chromium Chip and harvest the nuclei captured in droplet (i.e. GEMs) according to the Chromium protocol CG00052 Rev. D\nLibrary preparation and sequencing (Timing )\n27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reverse transcription, cDNA amplification, and library preparation are performed according to the Chromium protocol CG00052 Rev. D. Libraries can be sequenced on an Illumina sequencer. Sequencing two samples per lane of a HiSeq 4000 machine can yield ~100,000 reads per nucleus based on default CellRanger parameters and provide sufficient information for cell-type identification and differential expression analysis. Downstream analysis options for the sequencing results are described in Box 1.\nBox 1: Downstream data analysis\nAlignment, Demultiplexing, and Generation of Counts Matrix (Time: variable)\nSince our experiments utilized human nuclei, we built a pre-mRNA reference using the cellranger mkref (Cellranger version 2.0.1) command. Default parameters were used, starting with the refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-1.2.0 transcriptome and as per the instructions provided on the 10X Genomics website. For mouse tissue the corresponding pre-mRNA reference would need to be created for the mouse genome. We demultiplexed reads by sample index using the cellranger mkfastq command (Cellranger v2.1.0), aligned FASTQ files to the custom transcriptome, demultiplexed cell barcodes, counted the UMIs corresponding to genes using the cellranger count command and default parameters. These steps may be performed with custom code if desired.\nCustom Filtering to Recover Low Transcript Number Cell Types (Time: variable)\nWhile there are many options for software to be used for downstream analysis of snRNA-seq data such as scater\n33\n, SC3\n34\n, Monocle3\n35\n, etc., we used the Seurat R package (version 2.2.0, 2.3.0)\n36\n.\u00a0Unfiltered gene barcode matrices for each sample were loaded into R using the Read10X function. At this step, cell names can be modified such that the subject name, batch, and biological condition are appended to them. Seurat objects were created corresponding to each sample using the CreateSeuratObject function with the imported unfiltered gene-barcode matrices provided as the raw data. Individual Seurat objects for each sample were combined sequentially using the MergeSeurat function. No filtering or normalization was performed up to this step. Since we were working with a single nucleus dataset, all mitochondrial genes that are transcribed from the mitochondrial genome were removed, along with genes not detected in any cell. More recently several methods have been developed to align multiple datasets of snRNA-seq and other single-cell level data\n28,37\nwhich can be used for combining the data from individual subjects if inter-individual variability or batch effects are deemed to have a large influence on the results.\nFor preliminary filtering, some nuclei with very low number of genes detected (>110) and nuclei with very high numbers of UMIs detected (in the top 0.5%) were removed as low-quality nuclei and potential multiplets respectively. These cut-offs are arbitrary but can be based upon the distribution of the data. For example, in our dataset there was a sharp increase in the number of UMIs from 16,393 at the 99.5\nth\npercentile to 102,583 at the maximum which probably represents the multiplets in the dataset.\nIf the dataset contains multiple cell-types which are expected to be heterogenous in terms of the number of molecules of RNA present per nucleus (such as when the nuclei of different cell-types are known to be of very different size), the following approach can be used for removing low quality cells without unduly biasing the filtering against nuclei which biologically contain fewer molecules . For our dataset, given the known trend for higher number of RNA molecules in neuronal nuclei compared to glial nulcei\n10,11,38\n, the distribution of number of UMIs was fit with three normal distributions using the normalmixEM function from the mixtools\n39\npackage. The rationale is that the filtered barcodes contain a population of low quality \u201cnoise\u201d barcodes that have a very low numbers of UMIs on average, a population of non-neuronal cells that have an intermediate numbers of UMIs and a population of neuronal cells that have a high numbers of UMIs. After fitting\u00a0the normal distributions, only the barcodes with a high probability (> 0.95) of belonging to either the putative \u201cnon-neuronal\u201d or putative \u201cneuronal\u201d distributions, and a low probability (<0.05) of belonging to the \u201cnoise\u201d distribution were retained for further analysis. As an example,\u00a0in our publication, for a subset of 20 subjects, applying our custom filtering approximately doubled the total number of cells but increased the number of non-neuronal cells by almost 6 times\n20\n."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Single-cell and single-nucleus sequencing techniques are a burgeoning field with various biological, biomedical, and clinical applications. Numerous high and low-throughput methods have been developed for sequencing the RNA and DNA content of single cells. However, for all these methods the key requirement is high quality input of a single-cell or single-nucleus suspension. Preparing such a suspension is the limiting step when working with fragile, archived tissues of variable quality. This hurdle can prevent such tissues from being extensively investigated with single-cell technologies. We describe a protocol for preparing single-nucleus suspensions within the span of a few hours that reliably works for multiple post-mortem and archived tissues types using standard lab equipment. Moreover, these preparations are compatible with single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq using the 10X Genomics\u2019 Chromium system.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",
