            "content": "<p>Natural Killer cells (NKs) that comprise between 4-20% of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) <sup>(1)</sup> with a half-life of 7-10 days in the circulation <sup>(2)</sup> are the first line of defense against neoplasms without a need to prior sensitization <sup>(3)</sup>. Mature NKs also are found in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, lung, and omentum and in the uterus during gestation. They are regulated by stimulatory and inhibitory signals and express at least one specific inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) for a self-MHC class I allele to kill cells that lack self-MHC class I molecules <sup>(4)</sup>. In obese patients, there is a different cell homing pattern in adipose tissue (AT) <sup>(5)</sup>. In our laboratory, we found that some patients have increased levels of NKs in their abdominal AT while there is a decrease in NKs count in their peripheral blood (PB) despite no changes in a total number of PB mononuclear cells <sup>(6)</sup>. AT is a primary site of inflammation in obesity, and its macrophages especially M1 have the main role in these processes <sup>(7)</sup>. The AT secrete some hormones, play a role in glucose homeostasis <sup>(8)</sup>, and in addition to adipocytes, pre-adipocytes, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts and etc., <sup>(9)</sup> it harbors immune cell types including macrophages, neutrophils <sup>(10)</sup>, mast cells <sup>(11)</sup>, dendritic cells <sup>(12)</sup>, B cells <sup>(13)</sup>, T cells <sup>(14)</sup>, NK and NKT cells <sup>(15)</sup> (Fig 1). In obese patients a large population of NKs resides in AT which its count exceeds the blood stream NKs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Several protocols have been described in the NKs selection, expansion and activation with many cytokines or co-culture methods. We have tried many of these protocols and modified a new one <sup>(6)</sup>. This protocol is optimized for the human adipose tissue by providing extensive details of the technique to overcome limitations in NK cell purification and activation.</p>"

Resuspend pellet in the buffer for analysis by flow cytometer instrument.\n(It is recommended that side scatter be displayed on a log scale versus forward scatter on a linear scale).\nExpansion and Activation of NK cells\n33. Add purified NK cell from step 27 (1 million cells) to the 10 mL expansion medium in a T25 cell culture flask and incubate it for 3 days by constant shaking in a 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO\n2\n.\n34. After 3 days, harvest the cells by centrifugation at 300 g for 10 min.\n35. Add the cells from step 34 to a culture bag with 80 ml expansion medium and incubate it by constant shaking at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\n.\nNote: From the step 35 the NK cells are expanded in a closed system until the end of the process.\n36.

Keep NK cells in cultures for 2 days under constant shaking at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\n.\n39. Harvest cells as mentioned in step 34. This population that reaches to more than 10\n10\ncells could be used for\nin vitro\nor\nin vivo\npreclinical assays like cytotoxicity evaluation process.\nCytotoxicity evaluation of activated NK cells\nCytotoxicity of NK cells was determined by incubating them with target prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (we have used\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nPTCC 1240 and\nEscherichia coli\nPTCC1398 bacteria and neuroblastoma SKN-SH and CHLA-255 cell lines) at different ratios as follows:\n40.

In obese patients, there is a different cell homing pattern in AT. We have developed a protocol for NK cell isolation and expansion from AT as follows: 1) harvesting stromal vascular fraction, 2) negative selection of NK cells with MACS, 3) Expansion in a closed system bag on the constant shake, 4) Chemokine activation and 5) cytotoxicity evaluation test of the final product. The entire process with a population of ten billion CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells last only less than 16 days. We have noticed that a large population of NK cells entrapped in AT, while there is a decrease in NK cells count in their peripheral blood (PB) despite no changes in the total number of mononuclear cells. NK cell population harvested from AT has a different pattern in the expression of some cytotoxicity receptors. So, the AT is an important source for NK cell immunobiology studies.</p>",
