Keep stirring the mixture with a stir bar till it turned orange without distinct precipitation. \r\n  CAUTION If the reactants added into the ethylene glycol cannot be dispersed easily, ultrasonic treatment on the mixture for 10 min or even longer would help.\r\n\n\n3. 3.6 g Sodium acetate was added into the mixture until the iron source was totally dissolved and the suspension became dark brown.\r\n  4. Appropriate amount of cysteine were added into the mixture during the mixing process respectively.\r\n  5. The mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave in the fume cupboard after being sufficiently stirred and sonicated.\r\n  CAUTION The screws of the stainless steel autoclave should be tightened for guaranteed pressure and safety. \r\n\n\n6. The reaction was conducted at 200\u2103 in an oven for 12 h.\r\n  7. After the reaction was finished, the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was cooled to room temperature.\r\n  8. The products in the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was poured into a 50 mL centrifuge tube with the supernatant discarded. \r\n  9. The products was dissolved in ethanol and washed for several times through centrifugal separation at 5000 g for 5 min until the washings became clear.\r\n  10. The product of Cys-nFeS was obtained after drying at 60\u2103 for 4 h, and then preserved at 4\u2103"
