Read counts per amplicon were represented as reads per million or absolute read counts. The scripts for these steps are available at\nhttps://github.com/UBrau/SPARpipe\n3\n.\n3-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filtering out low-input samples: Before assessing the viral content of the samples, we set a threshold for defining low RNA quality. For this, we computed precision-recall curves for classifying control samples into 'low amplification' and 'high amplification' based on reads mapped to RNA amplicons but ignoring mapping to genomic sequence, if applicable. The \u2018low amplification\u2019 group contained all negative controls (H2O controls) and the \u2018high amplification\u2019 group comprised HEK293T and synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA controls. For each run, we obtained the total mapped read threshold (including reads mapping to both human and viral amplicons) associated with the highest F1 score, representing the point with optimal balance of precision and recall. Samples with reads lower than this threshold were removed from subsequent steps due to insufficient total amplicon read count. The scripts related to this step can be found at\nhttps://github.com/UBrau/ModelPerformance\n4\n.\n4-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determining positive and negative samples: We used viral read counts (total reads mapping to all three viral amplicons) from negative (H2O and HEK293T) and positive (synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA dilutions) internal controls for each run to calculate optimum cut-off for viral reads by PROC algorithm\n5\n, which defines the threshold for optimum PPV (positive predictive value) and NPV (negative predictive value) for diagnostic tests. Thus, a sample was labelled positive if it had viral reads above the viral read threshold; negative if it had viral reads below the viral read threshold and human reads above the mapped read threshold; and inconclusive if it had both viral and human reads below the respective thresholds.\n5-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample classification by heatmap clustering: We used the \u2018pheatmap\u2019 R package (\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap\n) to generate heatmap and hierarchical clustering of the samples. Viral and control amplicons log\n10\n(mapped reads+1), were used to analyze and classify all samples including patient samples, negative and positive controls. Samples that did not pass the RNA QC threshold (analysis steps 3-4) were excluded from the analysis.\n6-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Viral mutation assessment: To assess full length amplicons, paired end reads were stitched together by matching the last 12 nucleotides of read1 sequences to the reverse complement of read2 sequences. The number of full length reads per unique sequence variation were counted for each amplicon per sample by matching the 10 nucleotides from the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 end of the sequence with gene-specific primers. (scripts are available at\nhttps://github.com/seda-barutcu/FASTQstitch\n6\n, and\nhttps://github.com/seda-barutcu/MultiplexedPCR-DeepSequence-Analysis\n7\n). The top enriched sequences (WT or variant) from each sample are then aligned to the reference sequence using CLUSTALW V2.1.\n7-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-specific amplicon assessment: Single-end reads that contain the first 10 nucleotides of the illumina adaptor sequence were counted and binned into relevant forward and reverse gene specific primer pools by matching the first 10 nt of the reads with primer sequences. Relative abundance of the non-specific amplicons was quantified as percentage of the reads corresponding to non-specific amplicon per forward or reverse primer (Scripts are available at\nhttps://github.com/seda-barutcu/MultiplexedPCR-DeepSequence-Analysis\n7\n.\n8-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Computational requirements for the demultiplexing step is 32 GB RAM and minimum 1GB network infrastructure, with a Linux operating system.\nCode Availability\nWe provided the code for demultiplexing and mapping at\nhttps://github.com/UBrau/SPARpipe\n3\n, quality filtering at https://github.com/UBrau/ModelPerformance\n4\n, viral mutation assessment and non-specific amplicon assessment at\nhttps://github.com/seda-barutcu/FASTQstitch\n6\nand\nhttps://github.com/seda-barutcu/MultiplexedPCR-DeepSequence-Analysis\n7\n.\nEthical declarations\nEthical regulation\nPatient samples were obtained from the Department of Microbiology at Mount Sinai Hospital under MSH REB Study #20-0078-E, 'Use of known COVID-19 status tissue samples for development and validation of novel detection methodologies\u2019.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Population scale sweeps of viral pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, require high intensity testing for effective management. This protocol describes the \u201cSystematic Parallel Analysis of RNA coupled to Sequencing for Covid-19 screening\u201d (C19-SPAR-Seq), a multiplexed, scalable, readily automated platform for SARS-CoV-2 detection that is capable of analyzing tens of thousands of patient samples in a single run. To address strict requirements for control of assay parameters and output demanded by clinical diagnostics, we employed a control-based Precision-Recall and Receiver Operator Characteristics (coPR) analysis to assign run-specific quality control metrics. C19-SPAR-Seq coupled to coPR on a trial cohort of several hundred patients performed with a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 91% on samples with low viral loads, and a sensitivity of &gt; 95% on high viral loads associated with disease onset and peak transmissibility. This study establishes the feasibility of employing C19-SPAR-Seq for the large-scale monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.</p>",
