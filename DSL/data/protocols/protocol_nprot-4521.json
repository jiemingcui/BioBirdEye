            "content": "The function of proteins is frequently linked to their subcellular localization. Immunostaining, a common technique to detect cell type-specific gene expression, also monitors changes in protein distribution and abundance \\[1, 2]. In clinical nephrology immunostaining is still essentially limited to the detection of endogenous immunoglobulins and complement pathway proteins on frozen tissue sections. However, immunofluorescence techniques to characterize more architecturally preserved paraffin embedded tissue are increasingly used for research purposes and open the door to a deeper understanding of specific cellular and subcellular events.  \r\n\n\nUnlike chromogenic immunohistochemistry, fluorescence immunostaining of tissues provides high specificity and simplifies multiplexing for the simultaneous detection of several antigens. This multiplexing is particularly useful to analyze heterogeneous organs or tissues that contain different cell types which are identified with specific markers. An example of such a complex organ is the kidney. The cortex and medulla represent major layers of the kidney. Embedded in these layers are different parts of the nephron, including glomerulus, proximal tubule, ascending and descending limbs of Henle, distal tubule and collecting duct \\(reviewed in \\[3]). As a result of the spatial organization of the nephron, the kidney cortex and medulla contain different tubular cell types, which can be distinguished by marker proteins \\[4, 5].  Protein profiles and distribution vary in each tubular segment. For example, aquaporin-1, a water channel in the plasma membrane, is abundant in proximal tubules but absent in other tubular segments \\[6, 7]. \r\n\n\nHealthy cells of the proximal tubule are polarized; their apical and basolateral membrane domains differ in protein composition \\[1]. Under normal conditions, aquaporin-1 is present in high concentrations in the apical domain, but can also be detected in the basolateral domain \\[4]. Disease or aging often compromise the polarized membrane organization of kidney epithelial cells; this may cumulate in the improper distribution of proteins in the plasma membrane domains \\[1]. Such relocation is not limited to plasma membrane proteins, but affects other subcellular compartments as well. Ischemia-reperfusion injury \\(IRI) can result in acute kidney damage and ultimately kidney failure \\[8, 9]. As a consequence of IRI, the polarized organization of proximal tubule cells is impaired, and the separation of apical and basolateral membrane domains becomes compromised.\r\n\n\nReliable protocols are necessary to evaluate the cellular and subcellular changes in the kidney that determine renal function under health and disease conditions. Methods that identify specific kidney cell types and monitor a protein of interest will greatly enhance these analyses. To this end, we describe protocols that are compatible with multi-color fluorescent immunostaining of kidney sections. We used our procedures to assess the subcellular localization of the water channel aquaporin-1 \\[4, 6] and HuR, an RNA-binding protein that promotes renal cell survival upon ischemia \\[10]. Furthermore, these methods were applied to monitor the impact of ischemia on kidney cell morphology and the distribution of aquaporin-1 and HuR."

            "content": "**Application 1.** Effect of ischemia on the distribution of aquaporin-1. Aquaporins control water transport across the plasma membrane in the kidney and other organs \\(reviewed in \\[13]). Different aquaporin genes are expressed in the kidney in a cell-type specific fashion \\[14]. The aquaporin-1 protein is highly abundant in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule. In the proximal tubule, aquaporin-1 concentrates in brush border membranes of the apical domain, which is facing the lumen of the tubule \\[14]. In Fig. 1, we applied our protocol to locate aquaporin-1 in mouse paraffin-embedded kidney sections of controls \\(sham) and ischemic kidneys \\(30min ischemia). Following ischemia, the morphology of tubules was altered, material was found in the lumen of tubules, and aquaporin-1 abundance was similar in the apical and basolateral domains of the cells. These observations are consistent with an ischemia-induced impairment of cell polarization and alteration or loss of the brush border.\r\n\n\nOur protocols conserve the tissue organization under normal and disease-relevant conditions. Thus, they are appropriate to track physiological and pathological changes, as caused by ischemia, while preserving the ability to distinguish specific tubule segments.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Application 2.** Fig. 2 depicts the immunodetection of HuR, a protein located in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and aquaporin-1 in the glomerular and tubular cells. HuR shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm; this nucleocytoplasmic distribution depends on the physiological state of kidney cells \\[10, 15]. Accordingly, the staining protocol needs to detect both the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of the protein. Our protocol accomplishes this task \\(Fig. 2A, 2B, top row), as HuR was detected in different subcellular compartments and in distinct cell types. The presence of HuR in the nucleus is indicated by the overlap with DAPI staining \\(Fig. 2B, bottom row). However, HuR was also located in the cytoplasm, especially for cells outside of the glomerulus.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Application 3.** Detection of nonspecific fluorescence \\(Fig. 3). Nonspecific binding of antibodies and autofluorescence of the specimens can contribute to high background signals. With affinity-purified secondary antibodies these background signals were low for our protocol."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "The proper cellular and subcellular localization of proteins is critical to organ performance under physiological and pathological conditions. Reliable procedures to monitor changes in this distribution are required in experimental medicine and for clinical diagnosis. The kidney is particularly relevant to human health, because its damage is associated with various different diseases. Here, we describe a protocol for immunofluorescent staining of kidney sections. The procedure is performed on two consecutive days; it takes less than 5 hours to complete. Major strengths of the protocol are the conservation of tissue morphology, low background and the possibility to assess multiple proteins at the same time. Our protocol was applied to evaluate the effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury on kidney cells. The methods described by us were used to reveal ischemia-induced changes in cell morphology and protein distribution.",
