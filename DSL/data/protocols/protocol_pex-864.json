            "content": "<p>Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is revolutionizing basic and applied biomedical research. Among diverse applications, scRNA-seq readouts of pooled CRISPR genetic screens, also referred to as CROP-seq or Perturb-seq, enabled to identify the consequences of defined genetic perturbations on gene expression and cellular differentiation (Adamson et al. 2016, Dixit et al. 2016, Jaitin et al. 2016, Datliner et al. 2017). Although this concept has captured widespread attention, its broad applicability has been prohibited due to (1) high sequencing costs, (2) bottlenecks in data analysis, and (3) a lack of sensitivity of scRNA-seq methods.</p><p>Here we overcome these limitations by introducing a protocol for targeted Perturb-seq (TAP-seq) (Figure 1). The method has been established primarily as a readout for pooled CRISPR screens. However, TAP-seq is applicable to diverse single-cell applications in mammalian cell lines and primary mammalian cells, with or without CRISPR perturbations.</p>"

            "content": "Preparation of K562 cells for single-cell RNA sequencing (60 min)\nComment: We describe here a workflow for preparation of K562 cells for 10X Genomics. In general, cells for TAP-seq with 10X Genomics are prepared in the same way as cells for classical 10X Genomics.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Count live cells using cell counter and trypan blue live dead stain\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collect cells by centrifugation (200 g, 5 min, room temperature)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discard supernatant\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend in FACS buffer to achieve a cell concentration of 5-10 million cells per ml\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filter through cell strainer\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add viability dye, e.g. DRAQ7\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sort viable cells by flow cytometry into collection tube containing cell collection buffer (Figure 2).\u00a0All cell sorting can be performed at room temperature. Collected cells are stored on ice until use.\nComment: Flow buffer and cell collection buffer are compatible with 10X Genomics and other single-cell platforms. Same is true for DRAQ7 and other viability stains (validated for DAPI and PI).\nOptional: Cells expressing Cas9 as a fusion protein with a fluorescent tag (e.g. dCas9-BFP-KRAB) can be enriched for BFP-expression. We generally enriched for cells expressing intermediate to high Cas9 expression level (see\u00a0Figure 2).\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If high numbers of cells are available: Sort 0.1-1 million cells into 5 ml FACS tubes containing 300 \u00b5l cell collection buffer. Collect cells by centrifugation (300 g, 7 min, room temperature) and discard supernatant. Resuspend pellet in PBS by pipetting several times and dilute to achieve a cell concentration compatible with 10X Genomics, e.g. 1 million cells per ml. Double-check cell numbers and absence of multiplets by cell counting.\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If low numbers of cells are available: Sort cells directly into 20 \u00b5l cell collection buffer provided in a 1.5 ml tube. Cell numbers are deduced from flow cytometry counts, and by adding a correction factor of ~ 1.5x to 2x (has to be adapted, start with 1.5x). Cells are not counted again.\nExample: The correction factor considers cell loss during handling of cells after sorting, and the dilution factor during 10X Genomics single-cell Master Mix preparation and Chromium run. If 250 cells should be sequenced (and a correction factor 1.5x), sort 250 x 1.5 = 375 cells into 20 \u00b5l cell collection buffer. Approximately 3.5 nl (100 \u00b5m nozzle) or 7 nl (130 \u00b5m nozzle) liquid will be added on top per sorted cell. After sort is finished, vortex quickly to collect cells from tube wall, spin cells shortly, and measure volume. Then fill up with collection buffer to 33.8 \u00b5l, which is the volume added into the 10X Genomics single-cell master mix.\n10X Genomics Chromium run (90 min)\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare single cell master mix on ice according to the 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell 3\u2019 RNA-seq v2 protocol. Mix by pipetting and place on ice. 10X Genomics RT Enzyme Mix can be replaced by Superscript IV RT or not. 10X RT primer (template switch oligo) is replaced by low TE buffer (or H2O).\nRT Reagent Mix\n50 \u00b5l\nlow TE buffer\n3.8 \u00b5l\nAdditive A\n2.4 \u00b5l\nSuperscript IV RT\n10 \u00b5l\nComment: The protocol should be adaptable to Chromium single-cell RNAseq v3, and the more recent NextGEM protocol, since the PCR handle sequence on the 10X bead oligo is identical between all three 10X versions (target sequence of Partial Read 1 primer). Further, the steps until cDNA amplification are largely identical. We here follow the 10X v2 protocol until cDNA amplification.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fill unused wells of a single cell A Chip with 50 % Glycerol, as described in the 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell 3\u2019 RNA-seq v2 protocol.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0Add H2O and cells to single cell master mix (see 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell 3\u2019 RNA-seq v2 protocol cell dilution table), mix by pipetting, and transfer 90 \u00b5l of cell suspension to 10X Chip A well \u201c1\u201d.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0Prepare 10X Genomics beads by vortexing for 30 sec, and slowly dispense 27 to 40 \u00b5l of the bead suspension into 10X Chip A well \u201c2\u201d. 40 \u00b5l loading volume are suggested by 10X Genomics, but volume can be reduced to 27 \u00b5l, since beads are not used up completely during the run.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0Fill 10X Chip A well \u201c3\u201d with 230 \u00b5l partitioning oil, attach 10X gasket, and start run on the Chromium Controller.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0After run, check volume in GEM collection outlet and transfer 110 \u00b5l of GEM emulsion\u00a0into emulsion safe PCR 8-tube strip.\nComment: 10X protocol transfers 100 \u00b5l of the GEM emulsion only, but we generally observe a higher volume of GEMs in the collection outlet, allowing a 10% increase in cell recovery.\n14.\u00a0\u00a0GEM-RT incubation in a thermal cycler [45 min 53\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 5 min 85\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 hold 4\u00a0\u00b0C].

Follow the protocol as described from here on, but omitting the outer and inner primer mix.\nGEM-RT cleanup\n35 \u00b5l\n10 \u00b5M Partial Read 1\n4 \u00b5l\n100 \u00b5M outer primer mix\n2.5 \u00b5l\n12 \u00b5M CROPouter\n10 \u00b5l\nKAPA HiFi\n50 \u00b5l\nH2O\nad. 100 \u00b5l\n17.\u00a0\u00a0Run PCR1 with the following cycling protocol: 95\u00a0\u00b0C 3 min - [98\u00a0\u00b0C 20 sec, 67\u00a0\u00b0C 60 sec, 72\u00a0\u00b0C 60 sec] x12 - 72\u00a0\u00b0C 5 min - 4\u00a0\u00b0C hold\nComment: Exact cycle number has to be determined, but we achieved good results with 11 to 14 cycles. The cycle number depends on the number of cells, the amount of input cDNA, the number of amplified genes, and the expression levels of these genes. As a start, we suggest 12 cycles, which should result in\u00a0\u00b3\u00a010 ng of PCR product. Too high cycle numbers of PCR1-3 might result in a high MW product after PCR3 peaking around 1,000 to 1,500 bp; we generally do not observe any issues from this high MW product after Illumina sequencing and data analysis (product might not cluster efficiently during Illumina run preparation).\n18.\u00a0\u00a0After PCR is finished, collect liquid by short centrifugation and place at room temperature. Add 150 \u00b5l AmpureXP reagent (1.5x) to sample in tube strip and pipette mix 10 times.

After last wash, discard supernatant, spin down, and place back in magnet at low position.

Spin tube shortly to collect bead suspension from tube walls, and incubate 2 min at room temperature.\n23.\u00a0\u00a0Place tube back in magnet in low position and wait until solution is clear. Transfer supernatant into a new 8-strip tube and store on ice. Measure concentration from 1 \u00b5l eluate using Qubit dsDNA HS.\nComment: Typical yields are in the ng range from 10 to 250 ng.\n24.\u00a0\u00a0Samples can be stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 12 h or o/n before proceeding to PCR2.\n25.\u00a0\u00a0Prepare PCR2 on ice, mix by vortexing and collect by short centrifugation.\nComment: Use same amount of inner primer mix as above for PCR1 outer primer mix. The input amount of 10 ng can be used as a starting point, but can be lowered down to 5 ng. Lower input amounts might also work, but were not tested for library representation yet.\nPCR1 cleanup\n10 ng\n10 \u00b5M Partial Read 1\n4 \u00b5l\n100 \u00b5M inner primer mix\n2.5 \u00b5l\n12 \u00b5M CROPinner\n10 \u00b5l\nKAPA HiFi\n50 \u00b5l\nH2O\nad. 100 \u00b5l\n26.\u00a0\u00a0Run PCR2 with the following cycling protocol: 95\u00a0\u00b0C 3 min - [98\u00a0\u00b0C 20 sec, 67\u00a0\u00b0C 60 sec, 72\u00a0\u00b0C 60 sec] x8 - 72\u00a0\u00b0C\n5 min - 4\u00a0\u00b0C hold\n27.\u00a0\u00a0After PCR is done, collect liquid by short centrifugation and place at room temperature.
