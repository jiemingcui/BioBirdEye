            "content": "The normal function of muscle tissue is particularly reliant on mitochondria, to fulfill high energy demand, to regulate calcium \\[1] and to control ROS production \\[2]. Mitochondrial morphology is directly linked to many important cell and tissue functions, and consequently significant organelle remodeling is observed in response to changes in energy demand and cellular environment \\[3, 4]. Changes in mitochondrial morphology are also observed in a range of human pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases and neuromuscular disorders \\[4-6]. Understanding the role of mitochondria in disease pathogenesis has been greatly advanced by the visualisation of these organelles, using a variety of microscopy techniques to image affected tissues \\[5, 6]. Mitochondrial imaging by fluorescence microscopy is often utilised in medical research, but the currently available mitochondrial stains have mainly been limited to uses in live samples. This can be problematic for pathology testing, in clinical studies or in large cohort studies, where tissue samples are not able to be immediately processed for assessment, and tissue preservation by fixation is highly preferable before imaging.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSeveral different detection methods can be utilised to image mitochondria including endogenous fluorescence, small fluorescent molecule and immunochemistry. NAD\\(P)H is known to be associated with mitochondria \\[7] and produce a strong endogenous fluorescence at 489 nm \\(474\u2013504 nm emission interval), when exposured to two-photon illumination at 740 nm \\[8].  However this approach can only be utilized with live tissue or cells and must be performed in approapriate conditions to ensure tissue and cell health. The majority of small fluorescent molecules available for mitochondrial staining are also limited to use in live cells and tissues. These primarily organic fluorophores generally accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix, due to the organelles transmembrane potential. To date, the visualisation of mitochondria in fixed samples has relied on immunochemistry. While antibody detection is sensitive, it is time consuming and requires multiple processing steps that may introduce significant artefacts. Moreover, there are issues with antibody penetration into the sample. Therefore development of small molecule imaging tools that can quickly and effectively image mitochondria in both live and fixed tissue samples would offer greater flexibility in sample preparation. Recently described iridium tetrazolato coordination complex \\[Ir\\(**ppy**)<sub>2</sub>\\(Me **TzPyPhCN** )]+, \\(where **ppy** is a cyclometalated 2-phenylpyridine and **TzPyPhCN** is the 5-\\(5-\\(4-cyanophen-1-yl)pyrid-2-yl)tetrazolate ligand), commercially available as IraZolve-Mito, exhibits a high specificity for mitochondria in live H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts \\[9]. Here we describe a protocol for the application of IraZolve-Mito for the detection of mitochondria in paraformaldehyde fixed and frozen muscle tissue samples, which yields results comparable to well-established detection methods."

The powder should be dissolved in high-quality/sterile/anhydrous DMSO \\(55.1 \u00b5L) to prepare IraZolve-MitoTM stock solution of 10 mM, which can be stored at 4 \u00baC \r\n\n\nStock solution of IraZolve-MitoTM \\(10 mM) should be diluted in either complete sterile DPBS to a final concentration of 20 \u00b5M \\(1:500 dilution of 10mM stock solution). \u25b2 **CRITICAL** Prepare fresh 20 \u00b5M staining solution for each experiment. At the end of experiment, this staining solution should be discarded.\r\n\n\n**MitoTracker\n\u00ae\nRed CMXRos staining solution**\r\n\n\nPrepare 1 mM stock solution by adding 94 \u00b5L of high-quality/sterile/anhydrous DMSO to 50 \u00b5g of the lyophilized MitoTracker\u00ae product \\(MW = 531.52 g/mol). This stock solution can be stored at \u201220 \u00baC for at least one year. We recommend avoiding multiple freeze-thaw cycles. \u25b2 **CRITICAL** This imaging agent is light sensitive, therefore, store it in a dark container. For mitochondrial staining by MitoTracker\n\u00ae\nRed CMXRos, dilute the stock solution at 1:1000 either in complete DMEM media or in DPBS. At the end of experiment, this staining solution should be discarded.\r\n\n\n**4% PFA fixation solution**\r\n\n\nTo 4 g of PFA add 50 mL of distilled water. Add 1 mL 1M NaOH. To dissolve, heat and stir at 60 \u00baC. Once dissolved, add 10 mL 10 \u00d7 DPBS. Allow to cool and adjust to pH 7.4 with 1M HCl. Add distilled water to 100 mL, filter solution and store aliquots at \u201220 \u00baC. **\\!** **CAUTION** PFA is toxic. Please read the MSDS before working with this chemical. Gloves and safety glasses should be worn and solutions made inside a fume hood.\r\n\n\n**Saponin solution \\(10% w/vol)**\r\n\n\nDissolve 1 g of Saponin in 10 mL of sterile DPBS. Store at 4 \u00baC. For permeabilization of the cell membrane, add 100 \u00b5L of 10% Saponin \\(w/vol) in 10 mL of DPBS. This will yield 10 mL of a diluted solution with a final solute concentration of 0.1 %.\r\n\n\n**Blocking solution**\r\n\n\nDissolve 2.5 g of the lyophilized BSA powder in 50 mL of sterile DPBS; stir continuously.

This stock solution can be used for at least a year. For nuclear staining, prepare Hoechst 33258 at 1:1000 dilution in DPBS. \u25b2 **CRITICAL** This imaging agent is light sensitive, so therefore store it in the dark.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**EQUIPMENT SETUP**\r\n\n\n**Nikon A1+ microscope setup.** Essential components are as follows \\(note that while a specialist protocol has been presented, IraZolve-Mito can be imaged on any standard confocal or epifluorescent microscope):\r\n\n\n\u2022 A Nikon A1+ \\(Nikon, Japan) fitted with a LU-N4/LU-N4S 4-laser unit \\(403, 488, 561 and 640 nm), the A1-DUG GaAsP Multi Detector Unit \\(2 GaAsP PMTs and 2 standard PMTs) and a 32 channel spectral detector \\(Nikon, Japan)\r\n\n\n\u2022 An Uno-Combined-Controller, CO\n2\nmicroscope electric top stage incubation system \\(Okolab, Italy) holding 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\n\u2022 Collect images for IraZolve-Mito using a 403 nm laser set to 2 power setting and emission between 505 and 625 detected by the spectral detector, with gain set to 180 for cardiac tissue and 170 for skeletal muscle tissue. \u25b2 **CRITICAL** Note that for epifluorescence microscopy, IraZolve-Mito can be excited by UV/blue light sources with emissions collected using a wideband pass filter, or narrowband pass filter within emission range of 550-650 nm. For two-photon microscopy, IraZolve-Mito can be excited by 800-830 nm excitation wavelengths.

Keep tissues moist, but not mounted in DPBS as this may cause tissues to float away from the imaging surface. For example, mount tissues with a longitudinal cross-section in contact with the imaging surface of the chamber, where possible. Good contact between the sample and the surface can be achieved by gently pressing the tissue down into the chamber. Using samples that are roughly the same size as the chamber, can also help to hold the tissue in place. A dissection microscope can be used to place and orientate the tissues. For snap-frozen tissue add an appropriate amount of mounting media, such as 80% glycerol in PBS, to the section and add a cover slip.\r\n\n\n**?

            "content": "The mitochondrial pattern detected using these approaches should be similar to previous reports where these organelles are in association with each other and form a connected network that provides a conductive pathway for energy distribution throughout the muscle tissue \\[13]. In cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, mitochondria present as a regular network of cylindrical shaped organelles arranged in close proximity to sarcomeres \\(Figure 1). In live tissue MitoTracker <sup>\u00ae</sup> Red CMXRos and IraZolve-Mito staining and NAD\\(P)H detection should produce this characteristic mitochondrial staining pattern. The emission intensity from IraZolve-Mito should not decrease over time in tissue samples, and the protocol can be used for prolonged imaging at normal light intensity with minimal photobleaching due to the photophysical properties of this compound. However, both MitoTracker<sup>\u00ae</sup> Red CMXRos and NAD\\(P)H are prone to photobleaching and thus may be less suitable for these approaches. IraZolve-Mito will also produce mitochondrial staining in paraformaldehyde fixed and frozen tissue samples, producing similar results as antibody probing for the mitochondrial protein Cytochrome C. However the staining protocol for IraZolve-Mito involves significantly fewer steps then immunohistochemistry, which saves both time and money and reduces the risk of introducing artefacts. Additionally, IraZolve-Mito is not species specific, thus should be compatible with tissue from a range of model systems. Although similar results were obtained with these methods IraZolve-Mito has a clear advantage in its compatibility to a range of sample preparations and short protocol time."

Mitochondrial morphology is important for function and altered structure is exhibited in a large number of pathologies. Imaging of mitochondria can therefore provide important information about tissue health and disease presence and progression. Here we describe several approaches to mitochondrial imaging in skeletal and cardiac muscle using confocal and two-photon microscopy including; tissue staining with IraZolve-Mito and MitoTracker<sup>\u00ae</sup> Red CMXRos; antibody probing for Cytochrome C; and endogenous fluorescence detections from NAD\\(P)H localised to mitochondria.",
