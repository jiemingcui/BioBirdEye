            "content": "<p>Characterization of the oligomeric state of membrane receptors continues to be a substantial experimental challenge. Methods based on fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) <sup>1</sup>, such as Photon-Counting Histogram (PCH) analysis <sup>2,3</sup> Number and Brightness (N&amp;B) analysis <sup>4-6</sup>, and Spatial Intensity Distribution Analysis (SpIDA)<sup>7-9</sup> are promising approaches for studying protein interactions. In FFS-based approaches, the signal fluctuations caused by fluorescently labeled molecules diffusing in and out of a microscope focal region are analyzed with statistical methods to reveal properties of the molecules. Originally applied to quantify the diffusion of fluorescently labeled molecules in solution, FFS based approaches have been improved in recent decades to study the abundance and interactions of biomolecules in solutions as well as in living cells, and thereby offer a robust means for measuring both oligomer size and dynamics. However, current FFS-based approaches typically only provide average values of the oligomer size and concentration over mixtures of oligomers with different relative abundances and sizes. </p><p>This protocol describes the steps needed for using two-dimensional fluorescence intensity fluctuation (2D-FIF) spectrometry, a new method that can quantify the relative abundance and concentration dependence of oligomers of differing sizes in the presence or absence of ligands. The 2D-FIF spectrometry method relies on collecting fluorescence images of cells expressing the receptor of choice fused to a fluorescence marker protein. Regions in the fluorescence images where cells are present are divided into smaller subregions, or segments. The intensity fluctuations across the pixels in a given segment are used to calculate an \u201ceffective molecular brightness,\u201d <em>\u03b5</em><sub><em>eff</em></sub> , of each segment. The average intensity of the segment is divided by the effective brightness of a single protomer, <em>\u03b5</em><sup><em>proto</em></sup> , to determine the average concentration of receptors in that segment.&nbsp;By scanning a large number of cells, tens of thousands of segments are collected, and an effective brightness and concentration is calculated for each. From a 2D-map assembled from all the effective brightness-concentration pairs, effective brightness distributions can be generated for a number of different protomer concentrations ranges. Each brightness distribution, or spectrogram, is comprised of contributions from different sized oligomers and can be decomposed to find the relative contributions, or abundance, of each of the different oligomer sizes present across the measured sample. To extract this relative abundance information from each spectrogram, an effective brightness distribution must be generated from measurements on cells expressing a monomeric form of the fluorescent marker as well as cells expressing a tandem-dimer of the fluorescent marker. From the measured monomer and dimer brightness distributions, the brightness distribution for any oligomer of size <em>n</em> can be predicted, as the peak value of the size <em>n</em> oligomer distribution will be simply scaled by the size of the oligomer, i.e. <em>n\u03b5</em><sup><em>proto</em></sup> . Each composite spectrogram is then \u201cunmixed\u201d, with the unmixing components consisting of the various predicted oligomer brightness distributions. The relative abundance of each oligomer species is then computed as the fraction of the total area underneath the composite spectrogram that it occupies. After unmixing the spectrograms obtained from a number of concentration ranges, the trajectory of these relative abundances is plotted as a function of concentration. Along with evaluating the extent of oligomerization as a function of receptor concentration, the method is also can be applied to assess the effects of ligand-inducing shifts in the oligomeric size of membrane receptors of interest.</p><p>\tThe 2D-FIF approach can be implemented using standard laser scanning fluorescence microscopes, including confocal, two-photon excitation, and total internal reflection microscopes. A software package, titled the FIF Spectrometry Suite, is available at <a href=\"https://figshare.com/s/acfd94b21b1105317f56\" target=\"_blank\">https://figshare.com/s/acfd94b21b1105317f56</a> and can be used by following the steps listed in the detailed protocol below. The presented workflow describes the application applied to fixed cells, but the method can be used just as easily to probe protein oligomerization <em>in vivo</em>.&nbsp;</p>"

Generate cell lines stably expressing membrane receptors of interest and cells expressing monomeric or dimeric forms of the fluorescent marker protein; see previously described protocol\n12,13\n2. Maintain a healthy cell culture on T-25 flask. If cells are being revived from deep freeze, allow for at least two cell passages. Subculture cells if they are more than 85% confluent on flask. Subculturing of cells should be performed in a sterile environment using standard cell culture procedures\n3. Lift cells from T-25 flask and plate on poly-d-lysine coated chambered cover glass. Seed between 500-1000\u2219 cells/mm2 of coverslip growth area onto poly-d-lysine coated chambered #1.5 cover glass. The amount of cells seeded will ultimately depend on the doubling time of the cell line being studied. Allow the cells to grow for 36-48 hours in humidified incubator in order to spread out on the glass surface.\n4. Prepare cells for imaging\ni.\nAspirate cell growth medium\nii.\nWash cells twice with PBS\niii.\nIf exposing cells to ligand, add ligand solution to cells for desired time. If no ligand is being used, simply add PBS to cells for same amount time.\niv.\nRemove ligand solution or PBS solution and add 1.5 mL of 4% formaldehyde fixing solution. Leave cells in fixing solution for 20 minutes. Leave room lights off for duration of time\nv.\nRemove fixing solution\nvi.\nResuspend cells in PBS; cells now ready for imaging.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Image Acquisition Protocol\n1. Set the pixel dwell time for the measuring system to be at least a factor of five times shorter than the two-dimensional characteristic diffusion time,\n\u03c4\nD\n, of the receptor under study. The characteristic diffusion time is the average time a receptor molecule will reside within the measurement volume before diffusing out and is related to the laser beam waist,\n\u03c9\n, and the diffusion coefficient,\nD\n, through the following relation\n\u03c4\nD\n=\u03c9\n2\n/4D\n. The laser beam waist is defined as the distance from the center of the focused beam to where the intensity of the beam drops to\ne\n-2\nits maximum value.\n2. Obtain fluorescence images from several hundred cells for each type of experimental condition.\ni.\nSearch for cell/cells using scanning parameters with a reduced power or much shorter exposure time (preview scan) compared to the settings used for the actual data collection (fluorescence scan) so as not to expose cells to too much laser light.\nii.\nFocus on the basolateral membrane of a cell or group of cells using the preview scan.\niii.\nTake fluorescence scan of the focused cell/cells.\niv.\nRepeat steps\ni-iii\nuntil fluorescence images have been acquired from several hundred cells\n3. Obtain fluorescence images from cells separately expressing monomeric and tandem dimer forms of the fluorescent marker which has been fused to receptor of interest. Apply the exact same imaging conditions which were used to collect images of cells expressing fluorescently labeled receptor of interest.\n4. Obtain fluorescence images of sub-diffraction sized fluorescent microspheres for determining the laser beam waist size.\n5. Obtain measurements from a light source with constant intensity (i.e. no temporal fluctuations). Signal from a constant light source can be obtained from a number of different methods:\ni.\nLaser spot scanning the surface of a mirror slide in the plane of focus of the microscope. Remove filters used to eliminate laser light from striking the detector from the detection pathway. Acquire scans for a range of laser powers.\nii.\nTransmitted light illuminator turned on during acquisition. The same integration time settings can be used as was applied to the fluorescence scans. Acquire scans with a range of transmitted light intensity levels\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analysis Protocol\n1. Determine average background intensity of fluorescence images. All fluorescence images must be corrected for background prior to computing brightness values. Contributions to intensity levels due to background include the electronic offset (i.e. bias level) added to the output signal of the detector as well as dark noise. Determine this contribution by measuring the mean intensity in multiple ~10,000 pixel subregions of the acquisitions where there are no cells/fluorophores present and averaging the results from these multiple subregions.\n2. Determine slope and intercept for a plot of variance vs intensity for constant light source measurements.\ni.\nFluorescence intensity traces must be corrected for fluctuations in intensity arising due to the detector\n5,7\n.\nii.\nMeasure both the variance as well as mean intensity from small subregions of the scans taken of the constant light source.\niii.\nConstruct a scatter plot of the variance vs average intensity from all of the subregions measured. The relationship between the detector variance and intensity is linear and therefore the scatter plot can be fit with a straight line of slope\nS\n, and intercept, \u03c3\n2\n.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use FIF Spectrometry Suite to demarcate regions of interest (ROI) on fluorescence images of cells separately expressing monomeric and tandem dimer forms of the fluorescent marker\ni.\nLoad 2D fluorescence images for a given sample\nii.\nSelect ROIs using a polygon tool. Draw the polygon such that it encompasses the majority of the region inside the cell boundary. Multiple ROIs can be selected for each loaded image.\niii.\nSegment each ROI into smaller segments. The segmentation procedure is fully automated, the only user input is the maximum size of each segment. We have used a maximum segment size of 500 pixels.\n4. Use FIF Spectrometry Suite to calculate the effective brightness for each segment generated in the images of cells expressing monomeric and dimeric fluorescent protein constructs. Make sure to input the values for average background intensity,\nS\n, and\n\u03c3\n2\n.\ndetermined in steps C1 and C2 above.\ni.\nDetermine the monomeric effective brightness value,\n\u03b5\nproto\n, from the distribution of monomer and dimer brightness values calculated in C4\nii.\nSimultaneously fit the two spectrograms with Gaussian functions\niii.\nSet the Gaussian peak position simulating the monomer distribution to be\n\u03b5\nproto\nand the Gaussian peak position simulating the dimer peak position to be 2\n\u03b5\nproto\n. Use the same standard deviation for both Gaussian functions, but allow it to vary as a fitting parameter. Use the best fit value of\n\u03b5\nproto\nas the monomeric effective brightness value.\n5. Repeat step C3 for images of cells expressing the receptor of interest under appropriate experimental conditions.\ni.\nUse FIF Spectrometry Suite to extract brightness and concentration from each segment generated in C6\nii.\nCalculate the brightness and concentration of each segment using the mean and standard deviation obtained from the corresponding intensity histograms. The entire procedure of fitting starting at intensity histogram calculation and ending in the calculation of effective brightness and concentration of each of the segments is performed after a click of a single button. Be certain to input the values for\n\u03b5\nproto\n, average background intensity,\nS\n, and \u03c3\n2\ndetermined in steps C1, C2, and C5 above.\niii.\nCreate a two-dimensional surface plot of the frequency of occurrence of each effective brightness-concentration pair for visual analysis of the effective brightness distribution\niv.\nGenerate brightness spectrograms for various concentration ranges. The brightness spectrogram is a partitioning of the surface plot into one dimensional brightness spectrograms for a chosen concentration range.\n6. Use FIF Spectrometry Suite to perform meta-analysis of brightness spectrograms for various concentration ranges and obtain oligomer species fraction plots as a function of protomer concentration\ni. Fit the individual brightness spectrogram for a single concentration range with an array of Gaussian functions,\nS(\u03b5\neff\n)=\u2211A\nn\nexp^[-(\u03b5\neff\n-n\u03b5\nproto\n)\n2\n/(2\u03c3\n2\n)]\nThe mean value of each Gaussian function,\nn\u03b5\nproto\n, corresponds to the peak brightness value from a particular oligomer size\nn\n, and are all linearly related to a multiple of the monomeric molecular brightness,\n\u03b5\nproto\nii. Calculate the area underneath each Gaussian (relative to the area underneath the entire histogram).\u00a0This area reflects the relative abundance of the particular oligomer size corresponding to that Gaussian.\niii.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Current methods for determining membrane protein association in cells are either very time consuming, require complicated procedures, or lack the sensitivity needed to assess the effect of concentration or ligand binding on the observed oligomerization. To overcome these limitations, we provide a detailed protocol for quantifying the relative abundance and stability of oligomers of differing sizes using two-dimensional fluorescence intensity fluctuation (2D-FIF) spectrometry. The approach can be implemented using a standard laser scanning fluorescence microscope along with custom written software for image analysis. This method may be applied to evaluate the extent of oligomerization as a function of receptor concentration and is particularly suited to assess the effects of agonists and antagonists on the oligomeric size of membrane receptors of interest.</p>",
