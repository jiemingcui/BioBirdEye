            "content": "In this method, mature fiber number per cotton seed is determined according to the  ratio of fiber  weight to number. So, to sample representative fibers \\(with a normal length) is much important to get a precise result. Taking this method, we have counted the number of mature fibers from a cultivar of upland cotton, which is 12,318\u00b1462 fibers per seed. Three individual tests by different persons demonstrated  that this protocol is easy to operate, and the result is reproducible. Moreover, it is suitable for lab use, because a small amount of cotton seeds is needed."

Pick out six bundles of fibers \\(each around 1~2 mg) randomly from the fibers gathered. \r\n  3. Tease each fiber bundle by hand and weigh \\(W2).\r\n  4. Separate the ring and cap from the body of a micro-centrifuge tube \\(0.2 ml) by the knife. \r\n  5. Fix fibers of a weighed bundle by fastening the cap to the ring.\r\n  6. Put the bundle in boiling water for 10 min then cool it to room temperature. The treated bundle can be stored in 45% \\(v/v) acetic acid for a short-term \\(2~3 days).\r\n  7. Dry a bundle with dust-free paper then cut in the middle region of the bundle to get three fiber segments \\(the cutting length is about 1~2 mm).\r\n  8. Separate the snippets of each segments in six drops \\(each around 20 \u03bcl) of 45% \\(v/v) acetic acid by tweezers. \r\n  9. Observe and photograph the snippets of each drop by a stereo-microscope \\(MVX-10, OLYMPUS).\r\n  10. Count the snippet number in each drop by software Image-Pro\u00ae Plus. Then the fiber number of a bundle \\(N2) can be determined \\[\\(sum of the snippet number in total 18 drops from three segments of a bundle)/3].\r\n  11. Calculate the mature fibers number per seed \\(N1) according to the equation: N1=\\(W1/20)/\\(W2/N2)."

Estimating mature fiber number exactly is becoming more necessary, because only about thirty percentages of differentiated fiber cells could develop to mature fibers. To date, there is no method for counting mature fibers, except some ones for early fiber cells. Here, we describe a fast and easy approach for counting mature fibers per seed. That would help us finding the change of fiber number during cotton improvement.",
