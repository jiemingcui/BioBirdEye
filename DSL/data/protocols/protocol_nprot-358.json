For isolation of CD4+CD45RB high naive cells, after releasing the beads, incubate the purified CD4+ T cell suspension with \u03b1-biotin microbeads followed by separation using the Auto MACS. In all of our experiments, 99% of these cells were positive for CD4 and high for CD45RB. \r\n\n\n4| For the first intra peritoneal \\(i.p.) injection, inject Thy1.2+ C.B-17 scid mice with 4 \u00d7 10\n5\nfresh Thy1.1+CD25\u2013 CD45RBhighCD4+ congenic cells. \r\n\n\n5| After 6 or 7 days, administer an i.p. injection of PBS or 0.8-1 \u00d7 10\n6\nfreshly isolated Thy1.2+ Treg cells.  Control mice receive PBS in both the injections.  C57BL/6 Rag1\u2013/\u2013 or Rag2\u2013/\u2013 mice \\(CD45.1) can be used as recipients  C57BL/6 donor cells were transferred. After 6 or 7 days, they received an i.p. injection of PBS or 1 \u00d7 10 6 freshly isolated CD45.1+ Treg cells. Cells were transferred in 100ul of PBS/ mouse.  On day 6-10 after Treg cells were transferred, mesenteric lymph node cells or lamina propria cells were isolated \\(using the protocol from Current protocols in Immunology) and Annexin V and Propidium iodide staining was performed to measure apoptosis using flow cytometry.  TUNEL staining was also done on cryo-sections of the gut to measure apoptosis of the effector cells in the lamina propria of the gut followed by confocal immunofluorescence analyses."
