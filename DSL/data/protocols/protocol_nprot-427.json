            "content": "**Abstract**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Agrobacterium tumefaciens_-mediated transformation of filamentous fungi consists of \\(i) induction of _A. tumefaciens_ culture harbouring a binary vector, \\(ii) co-incubation of bacteria with fungal spores on a solid support, and \\(iii) selection of transformants. During the induction, _vir_ genes on the helper component of the binary vector are activated, conditioning _A. tumefaciens_ for transformation. During co-cultivation, T-DNA part of the binary vector system is transferred into fungal nucleus and inserted into the genome. Transformants are selected on a medium with appropriate antibiotic. In order to maximize the number of transformants, the ratio of _A. tumefaciens_ cells to fungal spores and the duration of the co-cultivation need be optimized. The procedure takes two to three weeks for fast-growing fungi.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Introduction**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nKingdom Fungi consists of about two million species<sup>1</sup>, which include pathogens and symbionts of plants and animals and major biomass decomposers essential for all ecosystems. From the human perspective, fungal fruit bodies are consumed directly and many traditional food products are manufactured by fungal fermentation. Industrially produced fungal cultures serve as the source of enzymes, antibiotics, vitamins, amino acids and other substances<sup>2, 3</sup>.\r\n\n\nThe growing number of sequences of fungal genes and entire fungal genomes, together with transcriptomics and proteomics data accumulating on model species, have generated numerous of hypotheses about the biological function of fungal genes. Many of these hypotheses exist as sequence annotations and are based on indirect evidence such as sequence comparisons and data on the regulation of gene expression. Verifying the accuracy of this annotation often is the major limiting step in the analysis of fungal genomes. These hypotheses normally are tested by gene inactivation, which can be achieved either by gene disruption via homologous recombination or by RNAi-mediated gene silencing. A crucial prerequisite for both methods is an efficient genetic transformation protocol. \r\n\n\nThere are four techniques suitable for the genetic transformation of filamentous fungi\r\n\n\ni. treatment of protoplasts with polyethylene glycol,\r\n\n\nii. electroporation,\r\n\n\niii. biolistic methods\r\n\n\niv. _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_.\r\n\n\nBefore de Groot et al.'s introduction of _A. tumefaciens_ into fungal transformation<sup>4</sup>, the most common method for the genetic transformation of filamentous fungi was treatment of a mixture of fungal protoplasts or spheroplasts and DNA with calcium salt and polyethylene glycol. The difficulty of protoplast preparation and regeneration, high batch-to-batch variation in the quality of enzyme cocktails used to digest fungal cell wall, and the low yields of transformants for some species were all important drawbacks. Electroporation and biolistic techniques were used rarely with relatively low yields<sup>5</sup> and unstable transformants<sup>6</sup> being common complaints. Since 1998, _A. tumefaciens_-mediated transformation of fungi has become a viable substitute for protoplast/polyethylene glycol method<sup>7</sup>. \r\n\n\n_A. tumefaciens_ is a soil-borne plant pathogenic bacterium that genetically manipulates its hosts by transferring a fragment of DNA \\(T-DNA) from its plasmid \\(Ti plasmid) into the plant genome<sup>8</sup>. T-DNA contains genes encoding enzymes of biosynthetic pathways for phytohormones and opines. Expression of these genes leads to the formation of tumors which serve the pathogen as an ecological niche and supplies it with nutrients. By replacing these genes with a cassette containing a gene to be transferred into the plant genome and a selectable marker, the _A. tumefaciens_-mediated transformation process can, and has been, used extensively for the past 20 years to genetically engineer plants. Protocols for _A. tumefaciens_-mediated transformation of dicotyledons such as _Arabidopsis thaliana_<sup>9</sup> and soybean<sup>10</sup> and monocotyledons such as maize<sup>11</sup> and rice<sup>12</sup> are well established. Since the discovery by de Groot et al.<sup>4</sup> that chemical treatment of _A. tumefaciens_ also enables this bacterium to genetically transform fungal mycelium, this technique has become available for the manipulation of fungal genomes. Similarly to the plant transformation process, a binary vector system consisting of a small plasmid with T-DNA and a second, large plasmid carrying the genes necessary for the process \\(_vir_ genes) usually is used. The technique is suitable for both large-scale random insertional mutagenesis and targeted gene replacement. Although the majority of fungal species transformed using _A. tumefaciens_ so far were Ascomycetes \\(58 species), the method has also been successfully applied to Basidiomycetes \\(15 species), Zygomycetes \\(4 species) and even fungus-like protists Oomycetes \\(3 species). A direct comparison of the protoplast method with A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation is not possible because the efficiencies are calculated in different ways: the number of transformants per &#xB5;g DNA is used in the former and the number of transformants per plate or experiment in the latter method. In our hands, establishing _A. tumefaciens_-mediated transformation for a new species is faster and easier as compared to the protoplast method. \r\n\n\nFungal transformation mediated by _A. tumefaciens_ consists of three steps: Induction of a bacterial culture harboring appropriate plasmids, co-incubation of the culture with fresh fungal spores on a solid support, and selection of transformants on a medium with a selection agents \\(**figure 1**). We optimized the method extensively and have used it routinely for the transformation of five species during the last six years."

Monitor the growth of the strain until OD600 reaches a value 0.5 to 0.9. Chill the flask on ice for 15 min.\r\n\n\n**Critical**: If cells grow over OD\n600\nof 0.9, dilute with fresh LB broth to an optical density of approx. 0.2 and regrow to desired optical density.\r\n\n\nIII. Pellet the cells in a sterile centrifuge tube at 4000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. \r\n\n\n**Critical**: Do not centrifuge at a higher g-value than needed to pellet the cells. More centrifugal force applied for a longer time reduces the survival rate after electroporation.\r\n\n\nIV.

A single large square subdivided into 16 smaller squares, which are divided into 16 mini squares each \\(0.0025mm\n2\n).\r\n\n\nI. Moisten the external supports with distilled water and push the cover glass gently onto the counting chamber from the front. The formation of interference lines \\(Newton rings) between the external support and the cover glass shows that the cover glass is correctly positioned. \r\n\n\n**Critical**: The cover glass is fragile and is special for this chamber.\r\n\n\nII. Place a drop of a diluted spore suspension into the counting chamber covered by cover glass. The gap between the cover glass and the chamber base fills up due to capillary action. \r\n\n\nIII. Place the counting chamber under a light microscope, select an appropriate  magnification and count spores in 4 small squares \\(figure 3). Spores crossing the border of a square are counted on two sides only for each square. \r\n\n\nIV. The spore concentration is calculated as:\r\n\n\nSpores ml-1 = total spore count in 4 small squares x 2500 x dilution factor. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**BOX 5**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Determination of the concentration of selection agent** \r\n\n\nFungal spores are plated on an appropriate agar medium \\(10\n6\nspores per 9 cm plate) containing a dilution series of hygromycin from 50 to 300 \u00b5g/ml. The lowest concentration at which no growth occur is selected for transformation. The most widely used antibiotic for the selection of fungal transformants is hygromycin B - \"Table 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1021/original/temp.doc. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PROCEDURE**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Preparation of fungal recipient** \r\n\n\n**=> Timing 20 days** \r\n\n\nPreparation of fresh fungal spores is described for _Gliocladium roseum_ \\(_Clonostachys rosea_) as an example. The optimal medium, incubation temperature and time varies with species. For most fungi investigated in the laboratory, culture conditions inducing sporulation are known. Factors enhancing spore production in most species are irradiation with near-UV light, incubation on media with a low nutrient content, e.g. straw extract, and the use of vigorously agitated liquid cultures instead of solid cultures.  \r\n\n\n1. Inoculate _G. roseum_ onto PDA agar and incubate for 20 days at 24\u00b0C. \r\n  2. Wash spores from one Petri dish with 3 ml of sterile tap water. Use a Drigalski spatula to release the spores gently from mycelium.\r\n  3. Collect spore suspension and determine spore concentration as described in BOX3.\r\n  4. Adjust spore density to 107 spores ml-1 with sterile tap water.\r\n  **Critical**: Store spore suspensions for transformation experiments at 4\u00b0C for no more than  50 hours. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Preparation A. tumefacies AGL1 as a donor**  \r\n\n\n**=> Timing 48 hours**\r\n\n\n5. Inoculate 10 ml of LB medium in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing appropriate antibiotics with a single colony of _A. tumefacies_ carrying a transformation vector - \"Table 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1021/original/temp.doc. Grow the strain at 28\u00b0C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm until the OD\n600\nreaches 0.5 to 0.9. For selection of _A. tumefaciens_ carrying Ti-plasmid pTiBo542\u0394T and any binary vector from the list shown in \"Table 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1021/original/temp.doc, supplement the growth medium with kanamycin, rifampicin, and carbenicillin at 50, 50, and 25 \u00b5g ml-1, respectively.\r\n  **Critical step** : _A. tumefaciens_ cultures for transformation experiments should always be grown from a single colony picked from a freshly streaked selective plate. Sub-culturing directly from glycerol stocks, agar stabs or old liquid cultures may lead to unsatisfactory results.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Pre-induction of T-DNA mobilization in _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_**\r\n\n\n**=> Timing 12 hours**\r\n\n\n6. Centrifuge 5 ml of the culture in a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube at 4000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. \r\n  7. Decant the supernatant as soon as the rotor stops. Add 1 ml IM to the cell pellet; pipet up and down or vortex gently until cells are uniformly resuspended.\r\n  8. Transfer the mixture to a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 4000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Wash the cells a second time by resuspending in 500 \u00b5l IM using the same technique. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 4000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. \r\n  9. Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 150 \u00b5l of IM.\r\n  10. Dilute bacterial cells to OD\n600\n= 0.15 with IM supplemented with 200 \u03bcM acetosyringone. Grow cells for 8-12 hours with vigorous aeration in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask at 28\u00b0C until the cells reach OD\n600\n= 0.3.\r\n  **Critical step**: Do not grow cells at temperatures > 28\u00b0C. If the culture develops visible clumps, do not use it. \r\n\n\n**Co-cultivation of _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_ and fungal recipient** \r\n\n\n**=> Timing 60 hours**\r\n\n\n11. Prepare 200 \u03bcl of a 1:1 mixture of the fungal spore suspension \\(10\n7\nml\n-1\n) and the induced _A. tumefaciens_ culture from step 10 and spread onto the surface of a cellophane sheet placed on an IM agar plate supplemented with 200 \u03bcM acetosyringone. \r\n  **Critical**: For uniform distribution use a sterile Drigalski spatula or a glass \"hockey\" stick. \r\n\n\n12. Incubate the plates for 60 hours at 23\u00b0C. \\(Optimal time and temperature may differ by species.) Transformation of all species listed in \"table 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1021/original/temp.doc was successful under these conditions.\r\n  **Critical**: A dense layer of mycelium must be formed at the end of the co-cultivation period \r\n\n\n\\(**figure 4**).\r\n\n\n**? Troubleshooting** \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Selection of transformants**\r\n\n\n**=> Timing: up to 7 days**\r\n\n\n14. After co-cultivation, use sterile forceps to transfer the cellophane membranes onto selection plates containing 200 \u03bcM cefotaxime and hygromycin B \\(or other antibiotic depending on the selection marker used).\r\n  15. After 7-10 days \\(may differ depending on the species), colonies of transformants should be readily visible on the background of decaying mycelium \\(**figure 5**). Transfer the colonies onto fresh selection plates containing the same antibiotics."

It can be used to generate hundreds of independent transformation events in one experiment and is suitable for saturation mutagenesis. \r\n\n\nAdaptation of the protocol to different fungal species is easy. A crucial parameter to determine for each fungal isolate separately is the concentration of the selection agents. No further optimization is needed when a limited number of transformants have to be generated \\(e.g., transformation of overexpression or silencing constructs). For genome-wide mutagenesis, the efficiency of the transformation should be maximized. The most important parameters to optimize are the ratio between A. tumefaciens cells and fungal spores and the duration of the co-cultivation."
