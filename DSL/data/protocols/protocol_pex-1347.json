Moreover, a number of <em>in vitro</em> models have been developed using hESCs/hiPSCs to study early human development, including micropatterned embryonic disc-like structures<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/cy503E/tnuLd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>2</sup></a>, embryonic sac-like structures<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/cy503E/OwGB4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>3</sup></a>, and human gastruloids<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/cy503E/q49wY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>4</sup></a>. This technological and medical revolution has been of great importance for disease modelling, drug screening, and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of several diseases, and embryo and organ development<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/cy503E/3e4Ld+hECPv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>5,6</sup></a>. However, despite the importance for the entire future of the individual on the complex spatio-temporal/cellular and molecular changes occurring during the early phases of blastocyst development, an <em>in vitro</em> integrated model of the human blastocyst has not been reported. While investigating the reprogramming process, we unexpectedly discovered that the reprogramming intermediates, when aggregated, could give rise to blastocyst-like cellular structures, which we termed as the induced blastoids (iBlastoids). Here, we describe a detailed step by step protocol for the generation of iBlastoids by reprogramming of human fibroblasts.</p>"

Primary human adult dermal fibroblasts (HDFa) from different donors can be obtained from Gibco (Catalogue number, C-013-5C) (lot#1029000 for 38F, lot#1528526 for 55F and lot#1569390 for 32F were used in this study).\n2. For recovery of the commercially purchased cryopreserved stock vials, cells are to be thawed quickly at 37\u00baC and then pelleted at 200xg for 5 minutes.\n3. Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of 106 medium (Gibco) supplemented with LSGS (Gibco) and plated into a T75 flask (one cryovial to one T75).\n4. Culture the cells in a 37\u00baC, 5% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\nincubator for expansion. Media are changed every other day and cultures split at a 1:3-1:5 ratio using Trypsin/EDTA Solution (TE) (ThermoFisher) upon confluency.\n5. For cryo-preservation, freeze cells in 90% FBS (Gibco) with 10% DMSO (Santa cruz); we suggest generating a large number of early passage stock for future experiments.\nHuman iBlastoids generation\n1. For somatic cell reprogramming with the Cytotune 2.0 kit, experiments were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen).\n2. To prepare the primary HDFa for reprogramming, seed the cells at a density of ~5-10x104 cells per well of a 12-well plate in fibroblast medium.\n3. After 36 hours, transduce the attached primary HDFa with Sendai viruses in fibroblast medium at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) as follows,\nKOS\nMOI=5,\nc-MYC\nMOI=5,\nKLF4\nMOI=6 in 500 \u03bcl of fibroblast medium per well.\u00a0 The cells are cultured in a 37\u00baC, 5% O2 and 5% CO2 incubator. The day of Sendai virus transduction is counted as day 0.\n4. After 24 hours of transduction (day 1), perform a media replacement with 1 ml/well of fresh and warmed fibroblast medium to remove the viruses.\n5. Perform a media replacement every other day from day 1 of transduction. Starting from day 8 onwards when the reprogramming cells are becoming highly proliferative, daily media replacement with 2 ml/well of fibroblast medium is required.\n6. On day 21 of reprogramming, the cells would be ready for the generation of iBlastoids.\n7. Before dissociating the reprogrammed cells, prepare the AggreWell 400 24-well plate (Stem cell technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, add 500 \u03bcL of Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution (Stem cell technologies) into each well of the AggreWell 400 24-well plate to be used and centrifuge the plate at 1300xg for 5 minutes. Ensure that no air bubbles are present after centrifugation and subsequently aspirate the rinsing solution from the wells. Perform an additional rinsing step with warmed basal medium, then add 1mL of Human iBlastoid medium supplemented with Y-27632 into each well. Place the plate in the incubator to be used later.\n8. For the dissociation of day 21 reprogrammed cells,\na. First aspirate the spent medium and perform a washing step with DPBS.\nb. Aspirate the DPBS and add 500 \u03bcl of TrypLE Express Enzyme into each well.\nc. Place the plate back into the incubator for 5 minutes.\nd. After 5 minutes, gently pipette the contents in each well to ensure that they have been well dissociated.\ne. Add 500 \u03bcL of fibroblast medium to stop the enzymatic reaction.\nf. Collect the cellular contents into a conical tube and centrifuge at 500xg for 3 minutes. If undissociated cellular patches are visible, we recommend filtering the cell suspension using a cell strainer size 40 \u03bcm (Corning) before centrifugation.\ng. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in appropriate volume of Human iBlastoid medium supplemented with Y-27632 for cell counting.\n9. Perform a cell count on the collected cells and dilute accordingly to a cell concentration of 1.2x105 cells/ml with Human iBlastoid medium supplemented with Y-27632.\n10. Take the prepared AggreWell plate out from the incubator and transfer 1 mL of well mixed cell suspension into each well of the plate. Ensure that the cells seeded into the Aggrewell are evenly distributed by pipetting the cell suspension in the well for several times carefully as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n11. Centrifuge the plate at 100xg for 3 minutes to capture the cells at the bottom of microwells.\n12. Observe the plate under the microscope to confirm that cells have been evenly distributed among the microwells.\n13. Carefully transfer the plate back to the 37\u00baC, 5% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\nincubator.\n14. 24 hours later, carefully perform a media replacement with warmed Human iBlastoid medium without Y-27632.\n15. On day 6 of iBlastoid formation in the AggreWell,\u00a0 the iBlastoids would be clearly visible and could be collected into a 15 mL conical tube. We recommend using wide bore p1000 pipette tips for the collection of iBlastoids to prevent any distortion. Alternatively, cut the end of a\u00a0 standard p1000 pipette tips for a wider bore to collect the iBlastoids.\n16. Let the iBlastoids in the conical tube to sediment for 5-10 minutes and carefully aspirate the majority of the supernatant to remove most of the cell debris.\n17. Transfer the sedimented iBlastoids into a 60 mm TC-treated Cell Culture Dish (Corning) filled with 3 mL of Human iBlastoid medium.\n18. Using a dissection microscope, carefully pick the cavitated iBlastoids for subsequent analysis."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>In the human blastocyst, as development progresses, cells of the epiblast (EPI) lineage will develop into the embryo proper and amnion, whereas cells of the trophectoderm (TE) and primitive endoderm (PE) will give rise to the placenta and yolk sac, respectively<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/cy503E/R6iZX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>1</sup></a>. The study of early human development relies on the use of blastocysts donated to research or cell culture systems such as pluripotent and trophoblast stem cells. Altogether, these have been seminal in shedding light on many key differentiation processes. However, simple culture systems lack the necessary complexity to adequately model the spatio-temporal/cellular and molecular dynamics occurring during the early phases of embryonic development. Currently, an <em>in vitro</em> model of the human blastocyst is not available.<strong> </strong>Here, we describe a protocol for the generation of an <em>in vitro</em> integrated model of the human blastocyst obtained by reprogramming fibroblasts, termed iBlastoids.&nbsp;</p>",
