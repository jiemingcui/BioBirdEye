            "content": "The use of human pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs) for disease modeling and drug screening requires rapid, robust and efficient differentiation strategies. This protocol describes the differentiation of hPSCs into endothelial cells, the major component of blood vessels. It is segmented in 2 stages, which recapitulates the developmental processes occurring during embryogenesis. First hPSCs are cultured for 4 days as a monolayer in a chemically defined medium supplemented with a GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor and BMP4 inducing commitment of the cell population to the mesodermal state. Cells are then cultured for 2 days in a different medium containing the vascular endothelial growth factor \\(VEGF). After only 6 days up to 80% of CD144 positive endothelial cells can be sorted and further expanded"

Store at -80\u00b0C or -20\u00b0C for a year.\r\n\n\nForskolin \\(10mM): Dissolve 10mg of forskolin in 2.436ml DMSO. Store at -20\u00b0C for a month.\r\n\n\nNote: Because they are sterile, opening and reconstitution of all recombinant proteins and other compounds should be performed under a hood using aseptic technique. \r\n\n\nAll recombinant proteins and compounds resuspended in DMSO should be pre-warmed for a few minutes in a water bath \\(37\u00b0C) before adding to the differentiation media. \r\n\n\nRecombinant proteins are highly unstable. Repeated freezing-thawing cycles would result in a rapid decreasing of their biological activity. Once thawed, aliquots can be kept at 4\u00b0C for a week.\r\n\n\nFibronectin: Add 1 ml sterile H\n2\nO to 1mg fibronectin and incubate at RT for 30min without shaking.\r\n\n\nAdd 39 ml PBS \\(w/o Ca and Mg) \\(=25\u00b5g/ml)\r\n\n\nAdd 6 ml of this solution in one T75 \\(= 2\u00b5g/cm\n2\n)\r\n\n\nIncubate for one hour at RT. Then wash the flask carefully without scrapping the surface once with sterile water. Coated plates are now ready to use. Plates can also be stored at 4\u00b0C if kept in the fibronectin solution. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Differentiation protocol**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote: This protocol is routinely used to differentiate different hESCs and IPSCs lines. However, some lines may require minor changes such as seeding density and GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor concentration. The example below describes the procedure to follow to differentiate cells in one T175 flask \\(Cat#3292, Corning). If performing differentiation in a smaller plate adjust media volume accordingly \\(for instance 3ml of N2B27 in a 12 well).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Maintenance of hPSCs**\r\n\n\n1. Human pluripotent stem cells are routinely cultured on matrigel in mTeSR1 medium. Cultures are passaged every 3-5 days using Accutase. \r\n  2. An 80% confluent 10cm plate is required to start differentiation in one T175.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Day 0: Plating hPSCs**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Coat one T175 with growth factor reduced matrigel by thawing it on ice and diluting it 1:30. \r\n  2. Incubate the plates at RT for 1h. Aspirate the matrigel, wash once with PBS and add 20ml pre-warmed mTeSR1+ ROCK-Inhibitor \\(final conc. 10\u00b5M).\r\n  3. Aspirate growth medium from an 80% confluent 10 cm plate.\r\n   4. Wash with 10ml pre-warmed PBS \\(Ca\n2+\nand Mg\n2+\nfree).\r\n\n\n5. Add 3 ml pre-warmed Accutase and incubate 3-7 min at 37\u00b0C.\r\n  6. Check cell\u2019s detachment under a microscope.\r\n  7. Add 3ml pre-warmed mTeSR1. \r\n  8. Transfer cells to a 15ml Falcon tube.\r\n  9. Count cells\r\n  10. Centrifuge the suspension at 1000 rpm \\(210g) for 5min.\r\n  11. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml pre-warmed mTeSR1+ ROCK-Inhibitor \\(final conc. 10\u00b5M). \r\n  12. Seed the cells at 37.000-47.000  hPSCs per cm\n2\n.\r\n  13. Incubate the cells at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\novernight.\r\n  Note: Starting cell density influences the yield of the differentiation and should be optimized for each cell line.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Day 1-3: Lateral mesoderm induction**\r\n\n\n1. Replace media with pre-warmed N2B27 Medium supplemented with 6-8 \u00b5M CHIR-99021 or 1 \u00b5M CP21 + 25ng/ml hBMP4 \\(125 ml/T175/ 3 ml/12well). For 3 days without medium change\\! \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Day 4 and 5: Endothelial cells induction**\r\n\n\n1.Replace Media with StemPro-34 SFM medium supplemented with 200ng/ml VEGF and 2\u00b5M forskolin \\(100ml/T175 or 2 ml/12well). Change medium every day\\!\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Day 6: Endothelial cell sorting and replating**\r\n\n\n1. Sort CD144 positive endothelial cells and replate on fibronectin coated plates. \r\n  5. Magnetic separation \\(MACS) of CD144-positive cells\r\n  \r\n\n\nNote: The following protocol describes the enrichment of CD144 positive endothelial cells using an autoMACSpro. Those cells can also be sorted using a manual MACS or by FACS using the PE-CD144 antibody.\r\n\n\nBefore starting sorting coat the appropriate type and number of plates required with fibronectin. Seed 2x10\n6\ncells in 20 ml StemPro34 + 50ng/ml VEGF. Expected yield from a T75 flask: 5-6x10\n7\ncells \r\n\n\n1. Aspirate medium and wash with pre-warmed PBS \\(Ca\n2+\nand Mg\n2+\nfree).\r\n  2. Add 5 ml pre-warmed Accutase.\r\n  3. Incubate for 3-5 min at 37\u00b0C.\r\n  4. Dissociate cells by gently pipetting up and down a few times to ensure single cells detachment.\r\n  5. Add 5 ml cold StemPro-34 Medium.\r\n  6. Transfer cells to a 50ml Falcon tube. \r\n  7. Count cells and calculate the volume of CD144 beads and MACS running buffer required for your sample \\(up to 1x10\n7\ncells in 80\u03bcl cold MACS running buffer + 20\u03bcl CD144-microbeads, see beads data sheet).  \r\n  Note: If checking for differentiation efficiency by flow cytometer keep 3x 105 cells at this stage and follow instructions in section 6. \r\n\n\nFrom this point work fast, keep cells cold and use cold solutions\\!\r\n\n\n8. Centrifuge at 1000 rpm \\(210g) for 5 min.\r\n  9. Aspirate supernatant.\r\n  10. Loosen cell pellet by gently flicking the tube and resuspend it in the appropriate amount of cold MACS-buffer and CD144-microbeads.\r\n  11. Incubate for 20 min at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  12. Remove the unbound beads by adding 5ml cold MACS running buffer and centrifuge at 1000 rpm \\(210g) for 5 min.\r\n  13. Aspirate supernatant, loosen cell pellet by gently flicking the tube.\r\n  14. Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml MACS running buffer.\r\n  15. Filter the cells by placing a 30\u03bcm pre-separation filter \\(Cat#130-041-407, Miltenyi Biotec) on a 15 ml Falcon tube.\r\n  16. Rinse filter with 0.5 ml cold MACS-Buffer to reduce cell loss.\r\n  17. Put the 15ml falcon in the first position of the autoMACSpro tube holder.\r\n  18. Add 2 other falcons in position 2 and 3 for the depleted and eluted cell fractions.\r\n  19. Choose and run program \u201cPosseld2\u201d \\(about 8min/sample).\r\n  20. After sorting count the eluted cells and centrifuge at 1000 rpm \\(210g), 5 min.\r\n  Note: If checking for sorting efficiency by flow cytometry keep 1x 105 cells at this stage and follow instructions in section 6. \r\n\n\n21. Aspirate supernatant, loosen cell pellet by gently flicking the tube and resuspend cells in pre-warmed StemPro34 + 50ng/ml VEGF.\r\n  22. Seed 2x10\n6\ncells in 20 ml StemPro34 + 50ng/ml VEGF on fibronectin coated plates or flasks \\(about 26000 cells/cm\n2\n).\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Differentiation and MACS sorting efficiency \\(optional)\r\n  Note: Differentiation and MACS sorting efficiency can be determined using flow cytometry and the CD144-PE antibody.  \r\n\n\n1. For differentiation efficiency keep 1x 105 as isotype control \\(IgG-Ab) \\(= sample 1), 1x 105 cells as unstained control \\(= sample 2), and label 1x 105 cells with CD144-PE antibody \\(sample 3). \r\n  \r\n\n\n2. For sorting efficiency label 1x 105 cells of CD144 positive and negative fraction with CD144-PE antibody \\(sample 4 and 5).\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Centrifuge the 5 samples in FACS tubes for 5min at 1\u2019000 rpm \\(210g).\r\n  \r\n\n\n4.  Resuspend each sample in 90\u00b5l cold MACS-Buffer.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5.  Keep sample 2 and add 10\u00b5l IgG Isotypic control or CD144-PE antibody in sample 1, 3, 4 and 5.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6.  Incubate for at least 15min at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Add 1ml cold MACS-Buffer and centrifuge 5min at 1\u2019000rpm\r\n  \r\n\n\n8.  Resuspend all samples in 250\u00b5l cold MACS-Buffer\r\n  \r\n\n\n9. Samples are ready for flow cytometry analysis.\r\n  10. \r\n7. Expansion of CD144-positive cells\r\n  1. Culture stem cell derived endothelial cells in StemPro34 + 50ng/ml VEGF until they reach confluency \\(usually 3-5 days). Cells can then be cryopreserved for further use \\(1.5x10\n6\ncell/vial) or expanded for functional assays such as in vitro angiogenesis assay. \r\n  Note: \r\n\n\nFor consistent reproducible results experiments should be conducted always at the same passage. We recommend to use differentiated endothelial cells between passage 3 and 4 and to not use them after passage 5. If compared to primary cells such as HUVECs, differentiated endothelial cells can be cultured in other media such as EGM2 medium \\(Cat# CC-3162, Lonza)."

            "content": "1. Cells are less/more confluent than the protocol picture on day 1\r\n  \r\n\n\nCell confluency on day 1 is one of the keys to differentiation efficiency. Cells should be seeded to look like day 1 picture.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Differentiation medium on day 4 is light yellow and there are a lot of dead cells floating.\r\n  Yellow medium on day 4 is a sign of plenty of differentiated cells. Excessive cell death can be observed when cells were too confluent on day 1.\r\n\n\n3. Differentiation efficiency is low\r\n  Differentiation efficiency lower than 20% could be due to wrong or inactive recombinant protein or wrong differentiation media. Make sure that you prepared your reagents and media correctly and kept them in proper conditions.\r\n\n\nDifferentiation efficiency between 20-50% could be due to an inappropriate seeding density or medium volume. \r\n\n\nMake a seriel dilution series for seeding density and GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor concentration to find optimal cell line specific conditons.\r\n\n\n4. Endothelial cells did not attached after sorting\r\n  Be sure your fibronectin solution was prepared correctly and that the plates were coated for at least one hour.\r\n\n\nWhen detaching the cells for sorting do not incubate the cells for too long in Accutase as it would result in massive cell death. Accutase can be further diluted 1:3 to 1:5 in PBS to avoid cell death.\r\n\n\n5. Endothelial cells are not growing\r\n  Differentiated endothelial cells grow slowly. Make sure to replate them at the correct seeding density \\(2x10<sup>6</sup> cells in 20 ml StemPro34 + 50ng/ml VEGF in one T75 flask). When expanding the cells, do not split them more than 1:4."
