Although proven to be very useful, they do not allow acquiring a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in urothelial homeostasis, differentiation and carcinogenesis.</p><p>In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) organoids have become a powerful tool to study the molecular and cellular basis of epithelial differentiation, allowing consistent culture and&nbsp;perpetuation <sup>1</sup>. Organoids are derived from cells capable of self-renewal and self-organization through cell sorting and lineage commitment in an in vivo-like manner <sup>2</sup>. The Clevers laboratory&nbsp;has pioneered the establishment of organoids from a wide variety of epithelia, including mouse&nbsp;small intestine <sup>1</sup>, liver <sup>3</sup>, prostate <sup>4</sup>, and pancreas <sup>5</sup>. Organoids facilitate studying tissue biology,</p><p>modeling disease, drug screening, and establishing a solid basis for regenerative medicine and gene therapy <sup>6</sup>. The majority of published studies have focused on organoids derived from simple&nbsp;epithelia. Recently, Lee et al. <sup>7</sup> have reported the establishment of organoids from human bladder tumors and Mullenders et al. <sup>8</sup> have described the features of normal mouse basal organoids and human bladder organoids. However, these reports have not leveraged on the potential of urothelial&nbsp;organoids to understand urothelial biology.</p>"

            "content": "1. Mouse bladder is accessed and turned inside-out leaving the urothelial surface exposed.\n2. The urothelium is enzymatically digested with collagenase P in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) in a thermoblock with gentle shaking at 37 \u00baC for 20 min.\n3.Collagenase P is inactivated with 2mM EDTA and 50% FBS.\n4. The cell suspension is collected and a scrapper is used to extract the remaining cells on the urothelium.\n5. After filtration through a 70\u03bcm strainer and centrifugation at 1200rpm for 5min at 4 \u00baC, the pellet is cleaned 2 times with washing medium (Advanced DMEM F12 medium + HEPES + GlutaMAX) and cells are embedded in 100% growth factor-reduced and phenol red-free Matrigel.\n6. Matrigel-cell suspensions (20 \u03bcL drops) are plated onto 6-well plates, allowed to settle in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00baC, 5% CO\n2\n, and overlaid with 2 mL complete medium (CM) (Advanced DMEM/F12, 1x penicillin/streptomycin, HEPES, GlutaMAX, WNT3A conditioned medium, RSPO1 conditioned medium, N2, B27, recombinant human EGF, N-acetylcysteine, recombinant human Noggin and LY-2157299).\n7. Medium is replaced every 2-3 days and cultures are usually expanded at a 1:4-1:6 ratio every 7-10 days.\n8. For organoids maintenance, medium is aspirated from the wells and washed once with PBS.\n9. Then, Cell Recovery Solution is added to the wells and plates placed on ice for 5 min.\n10. Matrigel and cells are collected and transferred to a tube for 30 min on ice.\n11. Cell suspension is washed with PBS, then with washing medium, and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00baC.\n12.Next, organoids are chemically digested with Dispase II solution at room temperature for 15-20 min in a rotating wheel.\n13. Next, the reaction is neutralized with 2 mM EDTA.\n14. Single cells are obtained by mechanical disruption of the organoids with a 21G needle syringe until no macroscopically floating organoids were observed.\n15. After cleaning the pellet twice with washing medium, cells are embedded in fresh ice-cold 100% Matrigel, seeded in 7 drops of 20uL each per 6-well plate, and covered with 2 mL CM unless otherwise specified.\n16. For differentiation experiments, NMU-o are cultured for the first 7 days in CM, reseeded (without disaggregation) in fresh Matrigel, and cultured with either CM or differentiation medium (DM) (lacking WNT3A and RSPO-1 conditioned medium, EGF, LY-2157299 and Noggin) for the following 7 days.\n17. All experiments can are performed without cell sorting based on EpCAM expression, using low-passage cultures (<10).\n18. In order to cryopreserve the organoids, Matrigel is removed from 7-day cultures with Cell Recovery Solution as previously described and are resuspended in freezing medium (10% DMSO in Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with Y-27632) at a density equivalent to 3 confluent drops/500mL.\n19. Cryovials are stored at -80 \u00baC.\n20. For thawing, vials are placed in a 37 \u00baC water bath and the contents washed twice with Advanced DMEM/F12 before reseeding in Matrigel at the required density."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Here we describe the establishment of mouse urothelial organoids from healthy urothelial tissue digests. NMU-o can grow within 7 days in medium enriched in growth factors, without FACS-sorting epithelial populations and can be passaged in culture for more than one year with stable morphology. In the absence of growth factors, NMU-o can differentiate within 14days exhibiting drastic morphological changes (increased diameter and lumen size, and decreased thickness layers) and expressing suprabasal urothelial markers (uroplakins and tigh junctions) both at the mRNA and protein levels. Transcriptomic tools (RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) were preformed further supporting this differences between proliferative and differentiated organoids, allowing the discovery of novel genes involved in these processes.</p>",
