The protocol is modified from the original description by Robert Lehrer et al. \\(1), which is well established for the analysis of antimicrobial peptides with aerobic bacteria. To perform analysis for facultative and strict anaerobes we modified the assay by the addition of the reducing agent DTT to assay medium and performed incubation steps in an anaerobic jar. It was successfully used with analysis of Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, Bacteroides and Escherichia coli \\(2) and might be adapted to other anaerobic bacteria. Several antimicrobial peptides have been tested with that system: while most of them showed less antimicrobial activity under reducing conditions, human beta defensin-1 was only active under these conditions against some of the mentioned strains."

Bacterial Preparation**\r\n\n\n 1. Prepare anaerobic bacteria from kryo-culture\r\n\n\n 2. Incubate on Columbia Blood-Agar plates in an anaerobic jar for about 48 hours\r\n\n\n 3. Transfer bacteria into 50 ml falcon containing 10 ml 1x TSB\r\n\n\n4. Place Falcon without lid into anaerobic jar, incubate for about 16 hours at 37\u00b0C without shaking. \\(Note: Since different bacterial strains behave differently optimal culture conditions should be optimized. Some bacteria might require shorter incubation times while others might require more time to produce optimal numbers of cells required for the assay.)\r\n    \r\n\n\n**C. Modified Radial Diffusion Assay**\r\n\n\n 1. Pre-chill centrifuge at 4\u00b0C\r\n\n\n 2. Place sterile phosphate buffer 10 mM, pH 7.4 on ice\r\n\n\n 3. Melt Underlay gel in microwave \\(Note: Mix gently to produce homogenous preparation.)\r\n\n\n 4. Transfer to 50 ml Falcons with 10-ml aliquots each; maintain gel liquid by placing in 46\u00b0C water bath \r\n\n\n 5. 5 \u2013 20 \u00b5l DTT can now be added into liquid gel from the 1 M stock solution. \\(Note: It is important to use freshly prepared DTT since repeated freezing and thawing impairs its function. Furthermore, some bacterial strains tolerate higher amounts of DTT while others do not. We obtained best results between concentrations of 0.5 and 2 mM \\(final) whereas 10 mM were mostly lethal. Depending on bacteria used different amounts of DTT might lead to best results.\r\n\n\n 6. 10 \u2013 20 \u00b5l resazurine can be added into liquid gel \\(final concentration 1 \u2013 2 \u00b5g/ ml). \\(Note: The addition of this redox-indicator is a good opportunity to control reducing conditions in the underlay-gel. A \u201cclassical gel\u201d should stain light blue while a reduced gel should look pink.)\r\n\n\n 7. Centrifuge bacterial overnight-culture in Falcons for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C and 900 x g\r\n\n\n 8. Wash bacterial sediment in 10 ml ice-cold sterile phosphate buffer 10 mM, pH 7.4\r\n\n\n 9. Centrifuge bacterial culture for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C and 900 x g\r\n\n\n 10. Resuspend sediment in 5 ml ice-cold sterile phosphate buffer 10 mM, pH 7.4\r\n\n\n 11. Determine Optical Density at 620 nm against a buffer control \\(10 mM phosphate buffer)\r\n\n\n 12. Adjust to OD\n620nm\n= 0.1 and use 150 \u2013 300 \u00b5l for assay \\(Note: The optimal volume of bacterial culture should be determined after the first experiments depending on the bacterial lawn obtained after the over-night incubation of the assay plates. In our hands it was optimal to use 150 \u00b5l for Bifidobacteria and 300 \u00b5l for Lactobacilli. For fast-growing bacteria like E. coli the user should refer to the classical protocol of Lehrer et al. \\(1))\r\n\n\n 13. Add bacterial suspension into 10 ml of warm, prepared underlay gel, mix gently. \\(Note: It is important that the gel is not too hot, which would have an effect on or kill bacterial cells, and not too cold since the gel would solidify. A temperature range between 42\u00b0C and 46\u00b0C should be fine for mixing with bacterial cells.)\r\n\n\n 14. Quickly pour the gel containing bacteria into square-petri-dishes, placed on an even surface, and let it solidify for about 30 minutes at room temperature. \\(Note: By letting a small opening between plate and its lid moisture level may be reduced, which improves punching of the wells later on. For strict anaerobic bacteria solidification time should be minimized).\r\n\n\n 15. Punch 6 x 6 wells into the gel and discard gel pieces with a sterile pipette tip or Pasteur-pipette connected to a vacuum pump\r\n\n\n 16. Fill up to 5 \u00b5l of proteins, dissolved in H\n2\nO or 0.01% acetic acid, into the wells. Include negative control \\(H\n2\nO or 0.01% acetic acid) and positive control \\(for example lysozyme, depending on bacteria tested)\r\n\n\n 17. Let protein solutions diffuse into the gel \\(short storage at 37\u00b0C or room temperature) and place plates into anaerobic jar for 3 hours.\r\n\n\n 18. Melt overlay gel in microwave, transfer to 50 ml falcons, 10 ml each, maintain at 46\u00b0C\r\n\n\n 19. Add DTT and resazurine, according to corresponding underlay gel\r\n\n\n 20. Pour 10 ml of nutrient-rich overlay gel onto each underlay gel and let solidify\r\n\n\n 21. Place plate upside-down in anaerobic incubator until bacterial lawn is clearly visible \\(16 to 48 hours)"
