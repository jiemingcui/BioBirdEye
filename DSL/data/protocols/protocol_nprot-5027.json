            "content": "DSBCapture is a substantially improved DSB mapping methodology derived from BLESS<sup>1</sup> that maps DSBs _in situ_ to single-nucleotide resolution. The procedure involves the ligation of a modified Illumina adapter to DSBs in fixed nuclei. The subsequent lysis of the nuclei and the fragmentation of the DNA generates a second free end, to which a second modified Illumina adapter is ligated. PCR amplification of the ligated DNA fragments generates a library that can be directly sequenced on the Illumina platform. DSBs are decoded to single-nucleotide resolution in single-end sequencing, where the first base sequenced identifies the site of _in situ_ DSB formation. The DSBCapture workflow is depicted in **Fig.1**. DSBCapture can be universally applied for the study of DSBs; these can for example be endogenous, drug-induced or nuclease cleavage sites. The complete experimental procedure takes approximately 8 days. We suggest using 20 million cells per sample: 10 million for the full procedure and 10 million for a control performed without T4 DNA ligase in the first ligation reaction. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4619/thumbnail/DSBCapture_workflow.png?1468846387\">See figure in Figures section.</a>"

Invert tubes to mix \r\n  Note: now that cells are in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes centrifuge samples in a bench top microcentrifuge \\(e.g. Eppendorf 5415R).\r\n\n\nCritical steps applying to all centrifugation steps until the nuclei are lysed: the pellet may not be visible in the tube by eye. Centrifuge with the hinge of the Eppendorf tube facing outwards so that the pellet will accumulate against the wall of the tube at the side with the hinge. Knowing the position of the pellet carefully remove as much of the supernatant as possible \\(approximately 50 \u03bcL can be left behind). If the pellet is accidentally removed it may be visible in the pipette tip. Do not discard the supernatant, but transfer it to another Eppendorf tube. Check the supernatant for nuclei \\(see below) \u2013 if the supernatant contains nuclei, centrifuge the supernatant again with a spin speed 1000 g greater than the indicated spin speed. Remove the supernatant and add the recovered nuclei back to the original tube \\(this is most easily done by adding the wash buffer or reaction buffer for the subsequent step to the pelleted nuclei and then transferring the nuclei/buffer solution back the original tube. Also make sure that the supernatant from this repeated centrifugation step is free from nuclei. Different cell types behave differently during the centrifugation steps and thus require slightly different spin-speeds. It is important not to loose material during the wash steps so we recommend checking the supernatant for nuclei after each centrifugation step and to re-centrifuge if necessary. Checking for nuclei: mix 10 \u03bcL of supernatant with 10 \u03bcL trypan blue and visualise nuclei using a light microscope. We use Ibidi slides to aid this process.  \r\n\n\n37.

Quantify DNA \\(e.g. Qubit fluorimeter) \r\n  106. Store samples at -20 \u00b0C or alternatively proceed directly to day 6\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Day 6: Second adapter ligation \\(modified P7 Illumina adapter)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n Work at room temperature unless specified otherwise.\r\n\n\nNote: anneal the modified P7 Illumina adapter with its complement before use \\(see methods in manuscript).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n107. Use 5 \u03bcl Dynabeads MyOne Strepdavidin C1 per 50 \u03bcg of DNA \r\n  Note: 10 million cells should yield over 50 \u03bcg of DNA but if less DNA is available use as much as possible; we have also performed experiments using 20 \u03bcg and observed a similar number of peaks \\(see: **Supplementary Fig. 4c** in the manuscript). \r\n\n\n108. Wash beads twice with 1 mL 1 \u00d7 W&B buffer + 0.1 % Triton X-100 \\(freshly added)\r\n  109. Add an equal volume of 2 \u00d7 W&B buffer + 0.2% Triton X-100 \\(freshly added) to the DNA to create a 1 \u00d7 final concentration  \r\n  110. Add the DNA to the beads \\(50 \u03bcg of DNA to 5 \u03bcl beads/tube, make volume up to 0.6 mL using 1 \u00d7 W&B buffer + 0.1% Triton X-100 \\(freshly added)) and rotate at 7 rpm for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C\r\n  111. Place tubes onto magnetic rack to capture the beads and remove the supernatant \r\n  112. Wash beads 3 \u00d7 in 1 mL 1 \u00d7 W&B buffer + 0.1 % Triton X-100 \\(freshly added)\r\n  Critical step: when washing the beads, replace buffer immediately after removing it. Do not let the beads dry.\r\n\n\n113. Re-suspend the beads in 42 \u03bcl 1 \u00d7 Blunting Buffer, add:\r\n  \r\n\n\n- 0.8 \u03bcl 10 \u00d7 Blunting Buffer\r\n\n\n- 0.25 \u03bcl BSA \\(20 mg/mL) \r\n\n\n- 5 \u03bcl 1 mM dNTPs  \r\n\n\n- 2 \u03bcl Blunting Enzyme Mix\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n114. Incubate for 45 min at 25 \u00b0C, shaking at 800 rpm every 5 min for 10 sec \r\n  115. Wash beads 3 \u00d7 in 1 ml 1 \u00d7 W&B buffer + 0.1 % Triton X-100 \\(freshly added)\r\n  Critical step: when washing the beads, replace buffer immediately after removing it. Do not let the beads dry.\r\n\n\n116. Re-suspend sample in 23 \u03bcl 1 \u00d7 NEBuffer 2 without Triton X-100, add:\r\n  \r\n\n\n- 0.5 \u03bcl 5 mM dATP\r\n\n\n- 1.5 \u03bcl Klenow Fragment exo-\r\n\n\n  \r\n\n\n117. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 45 min, every 10 min shake for 10 sec at 800 rpm\r\n  118. Wash beads 3 \u00d7 in 1 ml 1 \u00d7 W&B buffer + 0.1 % Triton X-100 \\(freshly added)\r\n  Critical step: when washing the beads, replace buffer immediately after removing it. Do not let the beads dry.\r\n\n\n119. Re-suspend sample in 39.4 \u03bcl 1 \u00d7 T4 Ligase Reaction Buffer, add:\r\n  \r\n\n\n- 10 \u03bcl 10 \u03bcM modified P7 Illumina adapter\r\n\n\n- 0.6 \u03bcl T4 DNA Ligase \\(2,000,000 units/mL)\r\n\n\n   \r\n\n\n120. Ligate for 15-20 h at 16 \u00b0C, every 45 min shake samples for 1 min at 1200 rpm \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Day 7: Library amplification**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n121. Wash beads 3 \u00d7 in 1 ml W&B buffer + 0.1 % Triton X-100 at room temperature\r\n  Critical step: when washing the beads, replace buffer immediately after removing it. Do not let the beads dry.\r\n\n\n122. Re-suspend beads in 25 \u03bcl nuclease free water\r\n  123. Place samples on ice\r\n  From this point forward work on ice for the rest of the day unless stated otherwise.\r\n\n\n124. Perform PCR: each 25 \u03bcl sample will make up 5 reactions\r\n  Note: Multiple PCR R \\(reverse) primers are available \\(see end of protocol). Each has a different barcode sequence to enable multiplexing of samples on the Illumina platform during sequencing. If multiple samples will be sequenced together in one sequencing reaction ensure that each sample is amplified with a different PCR R primer. Ensure to record the AD number of the primer used to amplify each sample. The AD numbers reflect Illumina TruSeq adapter sequences and thus DSBCapture libraries can be sequenced like Illumina TruSeq libraries \\(i.e. single index, 6 bp).\r\n\n\n125. PCR reagents per reaction:\r\n  \r\n\n\n- 1.25 \u03bcl 20 \u03bcM F primer\r\n\n\n- 1.25 \u03bcl 20 \u03bcM R primer\r\n\n\n- 5 \u03bcl Beads\r\n\n\n- 17.5 \u03bcl nuclease free water\r\n\n\n- 25 \u03bcl NEBNext High-Fidelity 2 \u00d7 Master Mix\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote: after the addition of all reagents pipette sample up down, do not centrifuge as this will cause the beads to pellet.\r\n\n\n126. Cycling parameters \\(total of 15 cycles):\r\n  \r\n\n\n1. 98 \u00b0C for 30 sec\r\n  2. 98 \u00b0C for 10 sec\r\n  3. 65 \u00b0C for 30 sec\r\n  4. 72 \u00b0C for 30 sec\r\n  Loop back to 2. 14 times, for a total of 15 cycles\r\n\n\n5. 72 \u00b0C for 5 min\r\n  \r\n\n\n127. Centrifuge to pellet the beads and recover PCR product \\(supernatant). Store the PCR product at -80 \u00b0C or alternatively proceed directly to day 8. Beads can now be discarded.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Day 8: Size selection, quantification and sequencing** \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n128. Either pass the PCR sample through a Qiagen MinElute PCR clean up column \\(100 \u03bcl PCR product / column) and then load sample into BluePippin gel extraction system \\(1.5 % agarose cassette) and extract 250-1200 bp OR omit PCR clean up step and directly load PCR product into 2 % hand cast agarose gel; manually extract band at 250-1200 bp and then clean up the DNA using Qiagen MinElute gel extraction kit.\r\n  Note: if performing manual gel extraction: the DNA concentration can sometimes be low and therefore the DNA may not always be visible, in such cases cut the gel using the reference ladder as a guide and continue. The DNA will be visible on the subsequent Bioanalyser profile.\r\n\n\n129. Run sample on Bioanalyser or TapeStation \\(high sensitivity chip) to determine the library size. All negative controls should not contain any DNA. See anticipated results \\(**Fig.3**)\r\n  130. Quantify DNA using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit \r\n  131. Proceed to sequencing and store excess DNA at -20 \u00b0C\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Oligonucleotide sequences**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nModifications: P = phosphorylated, ==*== = phosphorothioate linkage, Btn = biotin\r\n\n\nOligonucleotides are shown in the 5\u2019-3\u2019 orientation \r\n\n\nOligonucleotides have HPLC purity\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Modified P5 Illumina adapter:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBtnA**ATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATC**T\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Control modified P5 Illumina adapter:  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA**ATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATC**T\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Modified P5 Illumina adapter complement / Control modified P5 Illumina adapter complement: \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGCCGTATCATT\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Modified P7 Illumina adapter: \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Modified P7 Illumina adapter complement: \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATC*T\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 PCR Forward primer: \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGA\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nReverse primers contain Illumina barcodes \\(AD); the number refers to the sequence of the barcode. \r\n\n\nNote: PCR amplify each sample with a different reverse primer to enable multiplexing of samples during sequencing.
