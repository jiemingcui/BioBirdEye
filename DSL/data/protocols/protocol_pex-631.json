Top 15 precursors were selected with an isolation window of 1 Da and fragmented with HCD NCE of 30. MS2 scan was recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolving power of 15K. A lower mass limit of 110 m/z was set for DiLeu-labeled peptides. Dynamic exclusion was set at 45 s with a 10 ppm tolerance.\nG.\nData Processing\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw files were processed with Proteome Discoverer 2.1 engine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) with Byonic search engine (Protein Metrics Inc, San Carlos, CA);\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Searching parameters: spectra were searched against the Uniprot\nMus Musculus\nreviewed database with trypsin as the enzyme and maximum two missed cleavages. The parent mass error tolerance was set to be 50 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was 0.02 Da. Fixed modifications included DiLeu labels on peptide N-termini and lysine residues (+145.12801 Da) and carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues (+57.02146 Da). Dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine residues (+15.99492 Da). Identifications were filtered at 1% peptide and protein false discovery rate (FDR). Quantitation was performed in Proteome Discoverer with a reporter ion integration tolerance of 20 ppm for the most confident centroid. Only the peptide spectrum matches (PSM)s that contained all reporter ion channels were considered, and protein quantitative ratios were determined using a minimum of one unique quantified peptide;\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statistical analysis: Reporter ion ratio values for protein groups were exported to Excel workbook and student t-test was performed with biological quadruplicates. Proteins that had >20% fold change and P<0.05 were filtered as significant changes."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Isobaric labeling is one of the wide-spread high throughput proteome quantification strategies, where enzymatically digested protein extracts from different experimental groups are labeled with chemical tags and yield identical mass shift for individual peptides in MS precursor scan, whereas quantitation can be achieved by comparing reporter ion ratios upon fragmentation in tandem MS scan. In addition to commercial tags such as TMT and iTRAQ, we developed 4-plex and 12-plex N,N-dimethyl leucine (DiLeu) tags as cost-effective alternatives with comparable performance <sup>1,2</sup>. DiLeu labeling methods allow multiplexing of samples and enable comparative analysis of acetyl-CoA flux regulated proteomes from different mouse models in the same LC-MS runs, providing statistically reliable data that avoids run-to-run variations. This protocol describes steps including 40 hrs of sample preparation of lysis, tryptic digestion, tag labeling, SCX purification and high pH fractionation, as well as details about LC-MS/MS analysis and data processing. The protocol can be applied to other proteome quantitation systems.</p>",
