            "content": "<p>Antigen-specific T cells play key roles in a number of diseases including autoimmune disorders and cancer<sup>1\u20134</sup>. Assessing the phenotypes and functions of these cells is essential to both understanding underlying disease biology and designing new therapeutic modalities<sup>5\u20137</sup>.&nbsp;To study antigen-specific T cells comprehensively, two sequencing-based approaches have emerged: 1) bulk genomic sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires to assess clonal diversity, and 2) RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) to reveal phenotypic attributes. The TCR recognizes antigenic peptides bound in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptors and mediates CD3-dependent signaling upon cognate recognition; sequencing of the TCR repertoire thus can highlight clonotypic diversity and the dynamics of antigen-dependent responses associated with disease, such as clonal expansion or selection<sup>2,8,9</sup>. RNA-Seq, in contrast, can reveal novel states and functions of disease-relevant T cells through unique patterns of gene expression, albeit without determination of whether those cells are recognizing common antigens<sup>10\u201313</sup>.</p><p>Here, we report a simple process to sequence concomitantly both the transcriptome and receptor sequences of T cells from a single sequencing library generated using a massively-parallel 3\u2019 scRNA-Seq platform, such as Seq-Well or Drop-seq (<strong>Figure</strong> 1). In our approach, a 3\u2019 barcoded whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) is performed using standard protocols for Seq-Well or Drop-seq<sup>14-16</sup>. Next, one fraction of the amplified product is used to generate a 3\u2019 scRNA-Seq library to quantify single-cell mRNA expression levels in individual cells; another is used to perform direct single-cell TCR sequencing.&nbsp;For the latter, TCR transcripts contained within amplified 3\u2019 barcoded WTA products are first enriched by affinity capture using biotinylated oligonucleotide-probes targeting TCR constant regions, and are then re-amplified with the same universal primer site (UPS) used in the original WTA (<strong>Supplementary Table</strong> <strong>1a,b</strong>). Next, the amplified pool is selectively modified by primer extension using a set of oligonucleotides comprising a shared 5\u2019 second universal primer site (UPS2) linked to regions specific for each TCR V-region (<strong>Supplementary Table 2</strong>). The modified products are then further amplified with primers specific for UPS2 and an extended version of the original UPS, which is only present on the 3\u2019 end of the library. This final amplification adds flanking regions of oligonucleotides for sequencing to the TCR enriched library (<strong>Supplementary Table</strong> <strong>1b</strong>). The combination of targeted enrichment and primer extension produces a size-defined, CDR3-enriched library that does not require additional fragmentation before short-read sequencing (e.g., Illumina). The resulting library can then be sequenced using custom primers targeting the constant region of the TCR to directly recover the CDR3 region (<strong>Figure</strong> <strong>1</strong>, bottom right; <strong>Supplementary Table</strong> <strong>1c</strong>). This approach retains the original cellular and molecular identifiers appended during WTA, making it possible to match TCR sequences computationally with corresponding whole transcriptome profiles determined using traditional 3\u2019 scRNA-Seq.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Definition of terms:</strong></p><p><strong>WTA- </strong>Whole transcriptome amplified products.

Sequencing of final TCR libraries\n:\nHere we describe the sequencing condition for sequencing the prepared TCR libraries. For a detailed loading protocol, please consult Illumina.\nWe require the use of two custom sequencing primers (see\nSupplement\n). Due to the large size of the final libraries, we aim to load the flow cells to a lower density\nWe recommend sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq using the 150 cycle kit. For libraries consisting of high number of cells, a NextSeq could also be used.\nSequencing specification:\nRead 1: 150bp\nIndex 1: 20bp\nMiSeq:\nSequencing primers were used at a final concentration of 2.5\u00b5M. We aimed for 8-12 * 10\n6\npass filter reads per lane (cluster density of roughly 450K/mm2). Based on the whole-transcriptome data, we allotted ~6,000 T cells per lane.\nNextSeq:\nSequencing primers were used at a final concentration of 2.5\u00b5M. We aimed for 150-200 * 10\n6\npass filter reads per lane (cluster density of roughly 100K/mm2). Based on the whole-transcriptome data, we allotted ~80,000 T cells per lane.\nFinal fastq will contain TCR sequences in Read 1, and cell barcode with UMI in Index 1.\nAppendix.\nSPRI protocol and notes\nThroughout this protocol, we require purification of amplified products at various steps. In all cases, we aim to purify TCR products > 1kbp in length. Standard SPRI reagents could be used following manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Ampure XP, etc.). Here we provide a homemade alternative taken from Nadin Rohland (Doi:\u00a010.1101/gr.128124.111). Heretofore referred to as Serapure reagent.\nTo make homemade SPRI reagent\n:\n1. In a 50 mL conical using sterile stock solutions, prepare TE (10 mM TrisNHCl, 1 mM EDTA\n= 500 \u00b5L 1 M Tris pH8 + 100 \u00b5L 0.5 M EDTA, fill conical to 50 mL mark with dH20).\n2. Mix SeraNmag SpeedBeads and transfer 1 mL to a 1.5 mL microtube.\n3. Place SpeedBeads on magnet stand until beads are drawn to magnet.\n4. Remove supernatant with P200 or P1000 pipetter.\n5. Add 1 mL TE to beads, remove from magnet, mix, return to magnet.\n6. Remove supernatant with P200 or P1000 pipetter.\n7. Add 1 mL TE to beads, remove from magnet, mix, return to magnet.\n8. Remove supernatant with P200 or P1000 pipetter.\n9. Add 1 mL TE to beads and remove from magnet.\u00a0Fully resuspend and set microtube in\nrack (i.e. not on magnet stand).\n10. Add 9 g PEGN8000 to a new 50 mL, sterile conical.\n11. Add 10 mL 5 M NaCL (or 2.92 g) to conical.\n12. Add 500 \u00b5L 1 M TrisNHCL to conical.\n13. Add 100 \u00b5L 0.5 M EDTA to conical.\n14. Fill conical to ~ 49 mL using sterile dH20.\u00a0You can do this by eye, just go slowly.\n15. Mix conical for about 15 minutes until PEG goes into solution (solution, upon sitting,\nshould be clear).\n16. Add 27.5 uL Tween 20 to conical and mix gently.\n17. Mix 1 mL SpeedBead + TE solution and transfer to 50 mL conical.\n18. Fill conical to 50 mL mark with dH20 (if not already there) and gently mix 50 mL conical\nuntil brown.\n19. Test against AMPure XP using aliquots of ladder (Fermentas GeneRuler).\u00a0I recommend\nthe 50 bp ladder in place of the ultra-low range ladder.\n20. Wrap in tinfoil (or place in dark container) and store at 4\u00b0C.\nTesting\n:\nYou should test the Serapure mixture to ensure that it is working as expected.\u00a0You can do this\nusing DNA ladder (Fermentas GeneRuler \u2013 NEB ladders may cause problems):\n1. Prep fresh aliquots of 80% EtOH.\n2. Mix 2 \u00b5L GeneRuler with 18 \u00b5L dH20.\n3. Add 20 \u00b5L GeneRuler mixture to a volume of Serapure and/or AMPure (the specific\nvolume depends on whether you are trying exclude small fragments or not; see the\nfigure on the next page).\n4. Incubate mixture 5 min. at room temperature.\n5. Place on magnet stand.\n6. Remove supernatant.\n7. Add 200 \u00b5L 80 % EtOH.\n8. Incubate on stand for 1 min.\n9. Remove supernatant.\n10. Add 200 \u00b5L 70% EtOH.\n11. Incubate on stand for 1 min.\n12. Remove supernatant.\n13. Place beads on 37\u00b0C heat block for 3-4 min. until dry.\n14. Rehydrate with 20 \u00b5L dH20.\n15. Place on magnet stand.\n16. Transfer supernatant to new tube.\n17. Mix supernatant with 1 \u00b5L loading dye.\n18. Electrophorese in 1.5 % agarose for 60 min. at 100 V.\nSee\nFigure 4\nfor an example of expected results"

(top) Barcoded cDNA libraries (WTA products) include TCR\u03b1 and \u03b2 chains in addition to other transcripts. A portion of the cDNA is used to construct a sequencing library for transcriptomic sequencing, and analyzed via 3\u2019 gene mapping as previously described22. (bottom) Another portion of the same cDNA library is used for TCR recovery. TCR\u03b1 and \u03b2 transcripts are affinity enriched using biotinylated oligonucleotides specific for the TCR constant regions, followed by primer extension with V-region primer sets and PCR amplification using the UPS2 handles. Finally, the CDR3 region is sequenced using Illumina MiSeq with custom sequencing primers, and merged with the transcriptomic data based on single-cell barcodes.",

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>High-throughput 3\u2019 single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) allows for cost-effective, detailed characterization of thousands of individual immune cells from healthy and diseased tissues. Current techniques, however, are limited in their ability to elucidate essential immune cell features, including the variable sequences of T cell receptors (TCRs) that confer antigen specificity in T cells. Here, we present an enrichment strategy that enables simultaneous analysis of TCR variable sequences and corresponding full transcriptomes from 3\u2019 barcoded scRNA-Seq samples. This approach is compatible with common 3\u2019 scRNA-Seq methods, and adaptable to processed samples <em>post hoc</em>. We applied the technique to resolve clonotype-to-phenotype relationships among antigen-activated T cells from immunized mice and from patients with food allergy. We observed diverse but preferential&nbsp;cellular phenotypes manifest among subsets of expanded clonotypes, including functional Th2 states associated with food allergy. These results demonstrate the utility of our method when studying complex diseases in which clonotype-driven immune responses are critical to understanding the underlying biology.</p>",
