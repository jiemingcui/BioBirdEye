            "content": "Genetic code expansion, using orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs, forms the basis of powerful approaches for synthesizing proteins bearing defined post-translational modifications and complements protein semi-synthesis.\r\n\n\nSerial rounds of positive and negative selection are currently used to discover synthetases with altered specificity. Despite the clear utility of current approaches, they have certain limitations: i) it is not possible to follow the enrichment of individual clones through the selection to identify when substantial enrichment has taken place or which clones are substantially enriched, ii) the activity and specificity of isolated synthetase clones is restricted by the dynamic range of the negative selection; indeed, it is possible that the most active clones are deleted from the gene pool by negative selection, even though the activity of the synthetase they encode in the presence of an added unnatural amino acid may be sufficient to outcompete endogenous amino acid incorporation; iii) it is not possible to directly identify variants of a synthetase that have specificity with respect to many other unnatural substrates, and iv) the individual clones isolated at the end of the selection are picked randomly without regard to their relative enrichment or sequence.  Our ability to find hits is a function of the number of clones we examine and the frequency of the hit in the library following selection.  This is in turn is a function of the library size, the power of the selection steps to enrich the desired hits, the unknown frequency of hits in the library, and stochastic events.\r\n\n\nTo address the limitations of current selection approaches we proposed selecting synthetases using parallel positive selections in the presence and absence of an non-natural amino acid, coupled to deep sequencing and statistical analyses that compare sequencing read counts for each synthetase clone in the presence and absence of a non-natural amino acid. Here we describe a protocol, which details the process to selected aminoacyl synthetase/tRNACUA pairs that incorporate N\u03b5-\\(\\(1-\\(6-nitrobenzo\\[d]\\[1,3]dioxol-5-yl)ethoxy)carbonyl)-L- lysine \\(photocaged lysine, PCK), an amino acid that has been extensively used to optically control diverse protein functions."

Process raw deep sequencing reads using bespoke scripts written in the programming language Python. Each paired end read was first trimmed to 141 nucleotides. Paired end read 1 was concatenated with the reverse-complement of paired end read 2.

For matching sequences, the degenerate sites were extracted and collected into a comma-separated file together with the detected barcode ID\r\n  58. Construct an m x n counts table N of m unique mutants in n conditions. Each entry kij corresponded to mutant i in condition j. To identify the m mutants and their corresponding read counts, all unique rows in the comma-separated file were collected and their occurrences were counted. \r\n  59.

Spread 60 \u03bcl recovered cells onto LB agar plate containing 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin and incubate the plates at 37\u00b0C overnight\r\n  64. Pick three colonies from each plate and inoculate individually into 5 ml fresh LB medium containing 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin and incubate at 37\u00b0C overnight with constant shaking at 220 rpm\r\n  65. Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 4,000 g for 12 min. Extract the plasmids from each cell pellet using Qiagen Miniprep Kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions\r\n  66. Confirm the mutation by sequencing the plasmid\r\n  67. Repeat Steps 60-66 to introduce mutations on codon 241 and codon 313 if necessary\r\n  68.Transform pBAD_sfGFP\\(150TAG)-His6 to MegaX DH10B electrocompetent cells by electroporation and recover in pre-warmed SOC medium for 60 min at 37\u00b0C\r\n\n\n69. Spread 30 \u03bcl recovered cells onto LB agar plate containing 25 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline and incubate the plates at 37\u00b0C overnight\r\n  70. Pick a single colony and inoculate into 5 ml LB medium containing 25 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline and incubate at 37\u00b0C overnight with constant shaking at 220 rpm\r\n  71. Dilute the overnight culture into fresh 1 L LB medium. Prepare electrocompetent DH10B cells by repeating steps 27-31\r\n  72. Aliquot 50 \u03bcl competent cells into 2 mm electroporation cuvette. Add 1 \u03bcl PylS plasmid containing wild type or mutated sequence from Step 66 into each cuvette and electroporate with the setting of 2,500 V. Immediately add 1 ml SOC into each cuvette and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 60 min with constant shaking at 220 rpm. Snap freeze the rest of the competent cells in liquid nitrogen. These cells can maintain their competency for at least 6 months at -80\u00b0C\r\n  73. After incubation, spread 60 \u03bcl recovered cells onto an LB agar plate containing 25 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline and 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin.  Incubate the plates at 37\u00b0C overnight\r\n  74. Pick a single colony from each plate and inoculate into 5 ml fresh LB medium containing 25 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline and 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin.  Incubate at 37\u00b0C overnight with constant shaking at 220 rpm\r\n  75. Dilute 500 \u03bcl overnight culture into 25 ml fresh LB medium containing 10 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline, 25 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin, 0.2% \\(w/v) L-Arabinose, and 1 mM PCK.  Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 16hrs with constant shaking at 220 rpm\r\n  76. Pellet down cells by centrifugation at 7,000 g for 10 min\r\n  77. Resuspend cells in 1 ml His-tag Lysis Buffer and transfer to 1.7 ml eppendorf tube. Rotate end-by-end for 15 min at RT\r\n  78. Centrifuge at 20,000 g for 20 min\r\n  79. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube, add 30 \u03bcl Ni-NTA resin pre-washed three times with His-tag Lysis Buffer. Rotate end-by-end for 10 min at RT\r\n  80. Centrifuge at 1,000 g for 1 min. Carefully remove supernatant without disturbing the resin\r\n  81. Resuspend resin with 1 ml His-tag washing Buffer. Rotate end-by-end a few times by hand\r\n  82. Repeat Step 80-81 for four more times\r\n  83. Centrifuge at 1,000 g for 1 min. Carefully remove supernatant without disturbing the resin. Resuspend resin with 100 \u03bcl His-tag Elution Buffer. Rotate end-by-end a few times by hand. Centrifuge again at 1,000 g for 1 min.\r\n  84. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube. Estimate the protein concentration by Nanodrop.\r\n  85. Dilute the protein to the final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml with H2O and inject 5 \u03bcl to electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. Use 0.2 % formic acid in H2O as buffer A, and 0.2 % formic acid in acetonitrile \\(MeCN) as buffer B. Samples were injected into Phenomenex Jupiter C4 column \\(150 \u00d7 2 mm, 5 \u03bcm) and subsequently into the mass spectrometer using a fully automated system.\r\n  86. Theoretical average molecular weight of proteins with unnatural amino acids was calculated by first computing the theoretical molecular weight of wild-type protein using an online tool \\(http://www.peptidesynthetics.co.uk/tools/), and then manually correcting for the theoretical molecular weight of unnatural amino acids."

The current methods for discovering aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs depend on several rounds of positive and negative selections, which have certain limitations. Here we describe a protocol to address the problem by combining parallel positive selections with deep sequencing and analytical methods from differential expression analysis to create a scalable approach for synthetase discovery.",
