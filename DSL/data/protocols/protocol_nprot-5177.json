            "content": "Oogenesis incorporates a unique sequence of differentiation processes, during which biologically significant events such as meiosis and oocyte growth are orchestrated with communication to surrounding somatic cells. Reconstitution of this process using pluripotent stem cells would provide an efficient tool for uncovering the molecular mechanism underlying oogenesis, as well as to more practically establish an alternative source of gametes for reproduction. Indeed, efforts have been made to reconstitute in vitro oogenesis,<sup>1-3</sup> though none of them succeeded in the production of functional oocytes from pluripotent stem cells. We previously established a culture system that produces primordial germ cell-like cells \\(PGCLCs) from pluripotent stem cells. The PGCLCs were almost identical to primordial germ cells \\(PGCs), the precursor of eggs and sperm, in terms of gene expression, epigenetic status and functionality.<sup>4</sup> Of note, PGCLCs gave rise to sperm and oocytes by transplantation into neonatal testes and adult ovaries, respectively,<sup>4,5</sup> which means that PGCLCs have the potential to give rise to functional gametes. It is also worth noting, however, that the PGCLC culture system reproduces only 4-6 days of embryogenesis, and thus an additional 4-5 weeks of oogenesis, which seem to be more complicated than early PGC differentiation, have remained to be reconstituted. Here, we established a culture system in which the entire process of oogenesis is reconstituted in a dish, yielding in vitro-generated oocytes that are capable of full-term development to healthy pups. Based on previous reports,<sup>5-7</sup> the culture system is composed of 4 periods; PGCLC derivation, IVDi, IVG and IVM, which produce PGCLCs, primary oocytes, fully grown GV oocytes and metaphase II \\(MII) oocytes, respectively. The following is our step-by-step protocol for producing functional oocytes from pluripotent stem cells."

After 2 days of culture, add 1ml collagenase solution on the follicles.\r\n  18. Leave for 10-20 min at 37\u00b0 C.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Generation of functional eggs from pluripotent stem cells in culture would have impacts on reproductive biology and regenerative medicine. We have recently established a novel culture system in which mouse pluripotent stem cells differentiate to mature oocytes in a manner similar to oogenesis in vivo. Importantly, the in vitro-generated oocytes are capable of full-term development. This protocol consists of a culture method that can be mainly divided into four periods: primordial germ cell-like cell \\(PGCLC) derivation, primary oocyte differentiation \\(in vitro differentiation: IVDi), oocyte growth to germinal vesicle \\(GV) oocytes \\(in vitro growth: IVG) and oocyte maturation \\(in vitro maturation: IVM). In each process, a robust number of mouse oocytes can be generated in a dish.",
