            "content": "<p>Upon implantation, the mouse embryo undergoes a series of tissue remodelling events, that transform the pre-implantation blastocyst into the post-implantation egg cylinder. The precise sequence of these events cannot be delineated by analysis of fixed samples, even though these provide valuable insights.&nbsp;</p><p>We adapted the in vitro culture protocol established by our lab(Bedzhov et al., 2014), to optimise this system for blastocyst- and peri-implantation culture. Through this culture method, we have characterised the epiblast tissue morphogenesis from pre- to post-implantation(Bedzhov and Zernicka-Goetz, 2014). Therefore, the entire method was optimised for epiblast growth. This includes removal of a part of the trophectoderm lineage to maximise culture fidelity(Bedzhov et al., 2014).</p><p>To delineate the events driving the blastocyst to egg-cylinder transition, maintenance of both extraembryonic lineages is vital. To enable this, we developed a simple imaging technique for pre-implantation blastocysts, that allows imaging for up to 20h in 10 min time intervals, taking advantage of self-made imaging grids, that allow imaging of multiple positions, without the embryo moving out of position. To study the further development of the peri-implantation blastocyst into the post-implantation egg cylinder for up to 36h live imaging, we developed a simpler method based on thinly spread drops of medium on glass bottom dishes covered with mineral oil, that opens this developmental stage for analysis.</p><p><br></p>"

It is important not to pull the pipets too thin. The drop on the tip of the pipet should have the diameter of roughly 1 mm.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cut 150um nylon mesh into small rectangles of about 0.75 cm\n2\nand place it in a glass bottom dish. Be careful that the nylon does not stick to the side as it charges statically quite easily.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place a small amount of fresh silica in a petri dish.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take 2 glass pipets. With the first, hold down the nylon mesh. With the other, take up small amount of silica and glue the grid onto the glass bottom dish. Do this side by side until the net is held down by silica from all four sides (Figure 1A).\no\u00a0\u00a0Note: It is important, that the grid is pressed down firmly to the bottom of the dish, as otherwise the embryo can get stuck under the grid or move beneath the grid from one position to the next. To be sure, that the grid is attached to the bottom, a small drop of silica can be placed in the middle of the mesh and pressed down\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The silica must solidify overnight (~20h).\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before usage, the grids must be washed for a minimum of 5h, best overnight in ddH\n2\nO.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The grids can be stored and also reused, when washed with EtOH.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preparation for Imaging\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take glass bottom dish with washed grid and pipet 200ul of KSOM medium into the grid. Drop the plate gently from a height of 2-3cm, in order to remove air-bubbles trapped in the grid.\no\u00a0\u00a0Note: If air bubbles remain, use a 200ul pipet and pipet into the single wells, until air bubbles are gone. Then, take up most of the medium and replace with fresh.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cover the medium with mineral oil and incubate the glass bottom dish for 30 min minimum at 37\no\nC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\nto equilibrate the medium (Figure 1B).\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0E3.5 mouse blastocysts are collected as described previously(Bedzhov et al., 2014).\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After collection of blastocysts, mouth pipet them into the imaging plate, distribute blastocysts in one or two rows of the net.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take off medium with mouth pipet. Ensure that embryos are covered sufficiently.\no\u00a0\u00a0Note, if too much medium constitutes the drop on top of the grid, slight movement, exerted when carrying the plate to the imaging microscope, will lead to the embryos to move position.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Imaging\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ensure that imaging chamber is preheated to 37\no\nC and the CO\n2\n-levels are at 5%.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place a drop of oil on the 40x objective and then set imaging dish into the stage.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Imaging is carried out at a time interval of 10 min, which is sufficient to carry out single cell tracking of nuclear staining.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The z-resolution is set to 1um.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The imaging can be carried out for up to 20h.\nPeri-implantation embryo culture and imaging\nRecovery of peri-implantation stages\nRecovery of E4.5 embryos\no\u00a0\u00a0Note: This stage can be flushed as it was described before, but it was found that embryos have established first adhesion sites with the maternal endometrium, which will result in a very low yield when flushed. Also, flushing might result in damage of the mural trophectoderm, which already adhered to the maternal endometrium.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place uteri of E4.5 pregnant females in petri-dish in M2 medium\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove fat tissue with scissors.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sites of initiated implantation are visible under the recovery microscope as light shadows within the uterine tissue\no\u00a0\u00a0Note that at this stage, decidual swellings are not detectable.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cut uterus in pieces, each encompassing one of these hypothetical implantation sites\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove vasculature and carefully open uterus. For this hold down each side with forceps and cut with a sharp needle the uterus open from the inside to the outside.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When opening, a slight decidualisation is visible, where the uterine tissue almost loses. In this area, the embryo is localised in a small crypt.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slight touch with the needle will loosen the embryo out of the crypt and allow pipetting into a medium plate.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use mouth pipets for this stage, pull over an open flame.\nRecovery of E4.75 embryos\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this stage, small decidualisations are visible by bare eye.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clean uterus, then cut in pieces, each encompassing one decidual swelling.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cut off the outer layer of the uterine endometrium\no\u00a0\u00a0Note, that it is not necessary at this stage to remove the entire maternal endometrium. As the decidua is very small at this stage, it is sufficient of remove one side.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hold down either side of the decidua with forceps and open the decidua with a sharp needle.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The embryo has not been engulfed yet from maternal tissue, so it will be facing the opening.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carefully cut it out of the endometrium and remove remaining maternal cells through usage of a --- needle (the fine needle used for Reichert\u2019s removal)\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pipet into plate with medium or the imaging dish.

Note, that the culture was found to provide a higher success rate when not adding the hormones estradiol, progesterone and NAC. For this reason, these components were removed.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place small drops of medium in a culture dish.

Cover droplets with mineral oil and incubate the plate for a minimum of 1h prior to addition of embryos at 37\no\nC and 5% CO\n2\nin a humidified atmosphere.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare microscope: Set CO\n2\nlevel to 5% and temperature to 37\no\nC.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mouth-pipet embryos into drops, up to 6 embryos per drop.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Live visualisation of embryo development is a powerful tool for scientists to understand how morphogenetic events shape the embryo. Here, we report on a culturing technique that allows live imaging of pre- and peri-implantation mouse embryos throughout the process of blastocyst to egg cylinder transition, enabling single cell tracking and delineation of the tissue dynamics accompanying this morphogenetic stage. At the same time, this protocol can be used for pharmacological manipulations of mouse embryos.</p>",
