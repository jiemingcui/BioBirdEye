            "content": "<p>We systematically investigated the basic physics and chemistry of the crosslink-ligation principle; and developed next generation of the PARIS method (PARIS2). In particular, we report amotosalen as a more efficient crosslinker compared to the commonly used psoralen AMT. We discover that crosslinking increases RNA hydrophobicity, rendering it unextractable using the classical AGPC (acid guanidine thiocyanate phenol chloroform) aqueous-organic phase separation method (commercially known as TRIzol, etc.) or silica-based solid phase extraction methods<sup>1,2</sup>. We invent a generally applicable method, TNA (total nucleic acid extraction), to purify crosslinked RNA, enabling targeted analysis of RNAs with antisense enrichment. Given the low efficiency crosslinking, several methods have been developed to enrich crosslinked fragments, including native-denatured two-dimension (ND2D) gel, biotin-tagging and RNase R treatment, however, these approaches are often expensive and inefficient<sup>3</sup>. We develop a denatured-denatured 2D (DD2D) gel system to isolate pure crosslinked RNA without the need for tagging the crosslinker. We also introduce chemical and enzymatic approaches to prevent and bypass photochemical damages to RNA, a fundamental problem in RNA research. Together, these optimizations in PARIS2 resulted in &gt;4000-fold increased efficiency, and importantly, the deep mechanistic insights into photochemistry, RNA chemistry and enzymology for individual improvements are also broadly applicable in RNA studies.</p>"

Cut out the DNA from 175 bp and above (corresponding to > 40 bp insert).\n60)\u00a0\u00a0Use a syringe needle to punch a hole in the bottom of a 0.65 mL tube.\n61)\u00a0\u00a0Transfer the gel slice to 0.65 mL tube and insert into a 2 mL collection tube. Spin at room temperature, 16,000X g for 5 min. The gel slice gets sheared into slurry by passing through the hole.\n62)\u00a0\u00a0Remove the 0.65 mL tube and add 300 \u03bcL Gel elute buffer to the slurry. Shake at 55\no\nC, 1000 rpm overnight in a thermomixer.\n63)\u00a0\u00a0Pass the gel slurry through a Spin-X 0.45 \u03bcm column to recover the DNA library.\n64)\u00a0\u00a0Add 5x volume of Zymo DNA binding buffer and flow-through Zymo concentrator-5 column. Wash with 200 \u03bcL Washing buffer once and elute twice with 8 \u03bcL water (recover ~15 \u03bcL library). Quantify library by a high sensitivity Bioanalyzer assay.\n65)\u00a0\u00a0Barcoded libraries can be pooled together for sequencing if necessary.\n66)\u00a0\u00a0Sequence the libraries on an Illumina sequencer using standard conditions and the P6_Custom_seqPrimer.

            "content": "<p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>1. AMT cross-linked cell pellets should have a darker color than the non-cross-linked ones.&nbsp;</p><p>2. The PK digestion should clarify the solutions to some extent and greatly reduce turbidity. The addition of isopropanol should clarify the solution, resulting in obvious compact and stringy precipitates that contain both DNA and RNA, but little protein.</p><p>3. TNA sample: Most of the TNA sample should be soluble. If there is still some insoluble material, spin down and remove it. The cross-linked samples yield 60-70% of TNA compared to controls, and the A260/A280 ratios are usually in around 1.90, in the middle between the ratios for DNA and RNA. The A260/A230 ratios for the controls samples are usually above 2.1 and the ratios for crosslinked samples are usually below 1.9.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tape Station profile for the TNA from cross-linked samples should show an obvious smear across the entire size range, while controls show three major peaks, namely the small RNAs, the 18S and 28S rRNAs. The controls should have a RIN number close to 10 while the cross-linked ones have a RIN number below 8. Alternatively use bioanalyzer to check size distribution.</p><p>4. Purification of RNA using Trizol/chloroform will lose ~50% of cross-linked RNAs. It is better to extract RNA directly using phenol/isopropanol precipitation method.</p><p>5. After 5 mins of short cut digestion, reaction need to be stopped as soon as possible. Longer reaction time will reduce the RNA fragments size.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Typically, the AMT cross-linked samples have a stronger tail above 100 nt than the control samples.</p><p>7. Mth RNA ligases will tightly bind target RNAs, affecting RNA recovery efficiency. Proteinase K treatment will remove Mth RNA ligases before purification, and increase the recovery efficiency.</p><p>8. UV irradiation will produce heavy RNA damage, such as cyclobutene pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and (6-4) lesion. Absorption of UV photons produce RNA singlet and triplet excited states. In this respect, the characterization of the RNA singlet states are mainly responsible for the formation of pyrimidine photoproducts. Triplet excited states only play a limited role (less than 10%) (1-2). Acridine dyes bind to double strand RNA by intercalating between adjacent base pairs or by exterior ionic bonding, and inhibit the pyrimidine dimer formation. Energy transfer from RNA to acridine is important in the reduction of dimer yields. And singlet states of RNA are responsible for this transfer (3).</p><p>9. Denature treatment and 10% of DMSO will unfold the RNA duplexes and enhance the adapter ligation efficiency.</p><p>10. Due to the modular design of PARIS2, users can apply some of the improvements while not using others. For example, if amotosalen is not available to the user, AMT can be used, in combination with all other improvements. In this case, other improvements will remain effective.&nbsp;</p>"
