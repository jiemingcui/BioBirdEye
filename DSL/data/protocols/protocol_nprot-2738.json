            "content": "Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a severe deficit in motor function, cognitive and psychiatric changes.<sup>1</sup>. Pathogenesis is caused by an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat at the N-terminus region of the huntingtin gene \\(mhtt) <sup>2</sup>.\r\n\n\nIn the earliest stages, the neurodegeneration is highly selective for striatal GABAergic MSNs projecting to the external pars of the globus pallidum <sup>3</sup>. These cells belong to the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia circuitry and express the neuropeptide enkephalin <sup>4</sup>. Neuronal degeneration appears to be anticipated by reduction in enkephalin expression <sup>5</sup>. For these reasons accurate and specific immunodetection of enkephalin-expressing cells is a fundamental tool for the research in the field allowing quantification of peptide level and cell type-specific measurements. Here, we describe a protocol for fluorescent detection of the preproenkephalin \\(Penk1) peptide in mouse brain cryosections. Penk1 represents the precursor of the active form of the opioid peptide met-enkephalin which is obtained upon proteolitic cleavage <sup>6</sup>. Enkephalins represent endogenous ligands for the \u03b4-opioid receptor and are involved in the process of nociception<sup>7</sup>. \r\n\n\nIn our experience, fundamental to the success of the procedure is the fixation of the tissue, and the use of freshly cut cryosections for the immunostaining. Prolonged exposure to crosslinking fixative has the tendency to mask the enkephalin epitope compromising its detection."

Immobilize the fully anesthetized animal on an appropriate surface surrounded by a plastic container for recovery of any biological fluid.\r\n  3. Cut open the chest and secure the tissue in order to obtain visibility of the hart.\r\n  4. Insert a 20-gauge needle hooked up to a perfusion pump into the left ventricle.\r\n  5. Perform a small incision into the left atrium and perfuse the animal at 3ml/min for 3 minutes with TBS.\r\n  6. Switch the perfusion to CS at 3ml/min for additional 3 minutes.\r\n  7. Remove the brain from the skull and postfix it in CS for 1h at RT.\r\n  8. Wash the tissue twice with TBS to remove residual CS and place it in CPB until it sinks to the bottom of the tube.\r\n  9. Wash the brain twice with TBS to remove excess sucrose\r\n  10. Embed the brain in OCT and snap-freeze it using liquid nitrogen. Store blocks \r\n  at -80\u00baC until use.\r\n\n\n11. Prepare cryosections of 30-to-40 \u00b5m thickness in the appropriate orientation using a cryostat. Place free-floating sections in 24 well plates with 300\u00b5l TBS maintaining the sequential order.\r\n  12. Wash the sections twice with 300\u00b5l TBS for 10min.\r\n  13. Incubate for 30min at RT with QS.\r\n  14. Wash three times with 300 \u00b5l WS.\r\n  15. Incubate for 1h at RT with BB.\r\n  16. Remove BB and incubate tissues with 200\u00b5l AIB with 1:200 dilution of anti-preproenkephalin antibody and incubate overnight at 4\u00baC with gentle rocking.\r\n  17.

Here, we describe an immunohistochemical procedure for the detection of the unprocessed precursor of the opioid peptide met-enkephalin, namely the preproenkephalin \\(Penk1), in mouse brain cryosections. The specificity of the immunolabeling has been confirmed by crossing a reporter mouse line whereby EYFP expression is obtained upon Cre-mediated recombination in animals carrying Cre recombinase under the control of the preproenkephalin promoter.",
