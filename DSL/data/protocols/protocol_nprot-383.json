            "content": "Researchers whose work focuses on self-assembled structures in the biological sciences or nanostructures in the materials sciences are interested in high-resolution imaging.  Certain self-assembled structures occupy a size range where the theoretical limit of resolution by light microscopy \\(LM), which is on the order of 160 nm, is not adequate to image them.  The cell creates several types of protrusions.  The filopodium \\(plural, filopodia) is a slender, tapering extension of cytoplasm with a mean width of 50-100 nm.  Filopodia are especially challenging to visualize, because they may broaden to  &gt;160 nm at the base where they integrate with the rest of the cytoplasm.  Although the broader parts of the structures are often used to estimate the prevalence of filopodia on cells, the greatest number of the structures may be missing from the image viewed by LM.  Thus, LM imaging gives inaccurate and misleading results.  To accurately assess their prevalence, filopodia must be imaged with a high-resolution instrument or modality.  The filopodia serve as only one example of a cell surface structure that is at or beyond the LM limit.  Additional features, such as microvilli, coated pits, caveolae, and stereocilia, use self-assembly processes to create structures in the sub-LM range."

Thus, prewarmed fixative and its rapid addition to the cell culture while it is still warm are essential.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7-9.  Repeating the OsO4 exposure after a carbohydrazide step adds more reduced osmium to cellular details and increases the sample conductivity \\(references 1-3).  Carbohydrazide is substituted for the compound used by the workers who originally defined this procedure \\(reference  4).  The conductivity can be increased later in the procedure by using thicker coats of noble metal, but these obscure the details of the cell edge."

This exerts huge surface tension forces and collapses the structure.  Samples are especially vulnerable during steps where they are cut.\r\n  12. The samples are also vulnerable to air-drying during transfer to the critical point dryer.  Hexylene glycol is not volatile.  This makes it better than ethanol to avoid air-drying.\r\n  14. Thick coatings \\(3 nm or greater) will obscure edge details."
