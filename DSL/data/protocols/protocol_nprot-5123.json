            "content": "The ability to site-specifically install post-translational modifications, biophysical probes, unnatural amino acids, isotopic labels, and drug-like small molecules into proteins of any size offers enormous potential for both fundamental and applied biomedical research. Semisynthesis using expressed protein ligation \\(EPL) has been exploited frequently in the construction of proteins containing diverse chemical modifications. In standard EPL, a recombinant protein fragment is fused to an intein, which is then reacted with a thiol to generate the isolated recombinant protein  C-terminal thioester. An N-Cys containing synthetic peptide is then added to the protein thioester which undergoes transthioesterifcation followed by rearrangement to a conventional amide bond. While powerful, the scope of EPL is narrowed by the requirement of a Cys at the ligation junction. \r\n\n\n Subtiligase is an engineered peptide ligase derived from the protease subtilisin that contains mutations \\(S221C, P225A) which alter the mechanism to favor aminolysis over peptidase activity, facilitating the ligation of a peptide containing a C-terminal ester or thioester to a peptide containing an \u03b1-amine.\r\n\n\nWe describe here a general method for generating a protein thioester from a protein-intein fusion, and using subtiligase to ligate it to a synthetic peptide."

Clear the lysate by centrifuging at 15,0000 rpm for 45 min. at 4\u00b0 C. If insect cells were used, incubate the cleared lysate with powdered cellulose to remove chitinase \\(about 1 ml cellulose for every 2 ml lysate).\r\n  5. In a cold room, immobilize the fusion protein on chitin resin and wash to remove impurities.\r\n  6. Treat the immobilized fusion protein with cleavage buffer containing 300 mM MESNA overnight at room temperature and isolate the protein thioester in the eluate. \r\n  7. Exchange the protein thioester \\(by dialysis or ultrafiltration, as needed) into storage buffer.\r\n  8. Concentrate the protein to 1 mg/mL or greater. If not used within a day, flash-freeze for storage.\r\n  9. Mix the protein thioester \\(0.4 mg/mL or greater) with synthetic peptide \\(1-10 mM) and subtiligase \\(0.5-25 \uf06dM) in reaction at room temperature.  \r\n  10.

Here we present a method that employs subtiligase to efficiently ligate Cys-free peptides to protein thioesters.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4735/original/EnzymeEPLschematic.jpg?1472492845\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4735/thumbnail/EnzymeEPLschematic.png?1472492845\" > </a>",
