            "content": "Social recognition is a unique form of learning and memory that utilises distinct neural regions and neurotransmission specific to social cognition<sup>1,2</sup>. Mesolimbic dopamine is involved in reinforcement and reward learning. Concurrent activation of oxytocin or vasopressin and dopamine receptors in the reward centres of the brain during mating results in a conditioned partner preference, observed as a pair bond<sup>3</sup>. Mice usually demonstrate distinct forms of social memory: one transient and the other more enduring<sup>4</sup>. The transient social memories, like those tested in current studies of investigation or maternal behaviour, are normally held for a few minutes to an hour and seem geared more toward the differentiation of conspecifics or pups over short interactions or durations and involve the ability to distinguish between olfactory or visual signatures<sup>5,6</sup>. Here, we present two behavioural tests in males and females on social behavioural responses in wild-type mice or those with gene mutations. Using these paradigms, we have demonstrated that some important social and maternal behaviours<sup>7</sup> are significantly impaired in CD38-knockout mice as compared with wild-type controls<sup>8</sup>. Thus, assessment of behavioural traits described here could be useful when investigating mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with social deficits, such as autistic spectrum disorder<sup>9</sup>."

TIMING 1 min\r\n\n\n2. Begin the first trial by introducing a stimulus female into the home cage of a male mouse for a 1-min interaction. Record investigation time of the female by the male mouse. At the end of the 1-min trial, remove the stimulus animal and return to an individual holding cage. Score behaviour during experiments and  record behaviour on a videotape.

Simply, house each male with a female, which is not used as a stimulus mouse later, for 5 d before the first behavioural tests. Routinely, females are not ovariectomised.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP 2 Across all trials, define investigation as direct, active, olfactory exploration of the stimulus female by the subject male. In general, it consists of nosing and sniffing of the ano-genital region, close following and pursuit. Grooming, aggressive posturing and sexual behaviours, including mounting, are not included in measures of investigation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP 3 In our experiment, at the 3rd or 4th trial, the subject male showed a greater frequency of head-to-head contact, a behaviour that was qualitatively different from the investigation behaviour with an unfamiliar female in step 2.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP 4 Retrieval is defined as the dam picking up a pup in its mouth and transporting it to the nest in wild-type mice. In the case of CD38-knockout mice in our experiment, if the dam picked up and dropped the same pup more than once _en route_ to the nest, the retrieval was not scored until the pup was in the nest or placed within the one third of the cage nearest the original nest. The retrieval test was repeated 4 times with the same 1- to 5-day-old pups."

Mice displaying normal social recognition show a decline in investigation upon subsequent exposure to the same individual, and in the dishabituation trial, investigation times are similar to the initial exposure to the first individual \\(Fig. 1). Mice with defects in social recognition show no decline in investigation time. \r\n\n\n   Wild-type dams retrieved their pups precisely and very quickly to the same small area of the nest \\(Fig. 2a). Primiparous CD38-knockout dams took a long time to begin to retrieve and behaved as if they were not interested in their pups \\(Fig. 2b). They often dropped them during retrieval on the way to the nest, so that pups became scattered in different places showing the dam&#x2019;s abnormal nurturing behaviour \\(Supplementary Figure 4 of ref. 7). However, experienced CD38-knockout dams behaved similarly to wild-type controls \\(Fig. 2c)."
