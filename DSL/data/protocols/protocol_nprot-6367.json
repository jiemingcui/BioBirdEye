            "content": "RNA-protein interactions are pervasive in biological processes and play a critical role in regulating cellular function<sup>1,2</sup>. Approximately 5% of the human proteome has been experimentally identified as capable of binding RNA and recent work has revealed several networks of RNA-protein interactions that regulate genomic stability and cellular signaling in addition to gene expression<sup>3\u20135</sup>. Consequently, there is growing interest in utilizing synthetic RNAs as drugs and as tools to control cellular circuits<sup>6,7</sup>.\r\n\n\nDiscovery and study of RNA-protein interactions has lagged the growing appreciation of their biological importance due to limitations in existing methods. Current methods rely on purifying RNA of interest to discover protein binding partners lead to biases  owing  to  post-lysis  re-assortments  and  generate  high  false  positives \\(Supplementary  Table   1)<sup>8,9</sup>.  RNAs  fold  and  adopt  complex  structures  in  cellular environment  and  such  structures  are  critical  in  mediating  interactions  with  proteins<sup>10</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMethods to study known RNA-protein interactions just as RNA-MaP & RNA-compete are performed in artificial settings that do not provide conditions reflective of RNA-protein interaction in living cells and require specialized equipment \\(Supplementary Table 1)<sup>11</sup>.\r\n\n\nTo overcome these technical limitations, a methodology was developed to directly tag and isolate proteins that bind to specific RNA motifs in intact live cells. A modified promiscuous biotin ligase from E. coli, BirA**, biotinylates proximal proteins within a range of 10nm and has been used to study protein-protein interactions<sup>12,13</sup>. Biotinylation of target proteins permits stringent washing and reduces background. Phage biology was leveraged to design a tool utilizing BirA** to biotin tag proteins bound to RNA motifs in living cells followed by streptavidin pull-down and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins, terming it RaPID for RNA-Protein Interaction Detection."

Here we describe RNA-protein interaction detection \\(RaPID), which uses proximity-dependent protein labeling, based on the BirA** biotin ligase, to rapidly identify the proteins that bind RNA sequences of interest in living cells. RaPID displays utility in multiple applications, including in evaluating protein binding to mutant RNA motifs in human genetic disorders, in uncovering potential post-transcriptional networks in breast cancer, and in discovering essential host proteins that interact with Zika virus RNA. To improve the BirA** labeling component of RaPID, moreover, a new mutant BirA** was engineered from B. subtilis that enables >1000-fold faster kinetics and >30-fold increased signal-to-noise ratio over the prior standard E. coli BirA**, thereby enabling direct study of RNA-protein interactions in living cells on a timescale as short as one minute.",
