            "content": "Photolithography\nWafer preparation:\n- Clean the wafer with acetone in an US bath for 5 minutes.\n- Clean the wafer with IPA in an US bath for 5 minutes\n- Remove the solvents with de-ionized water using a QDR until a resistivity of 12 MOhm cm is reached.\n- Dry the wafer in a spin-rinse-dryer.\n- Bake the wafer at 200 \u00b0C on a preheated hotplate for 5 minutes.\n- Remove the wafer from hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.\nSpin coating:\n- Place the cleaned wafer in a spin coater and dispense 4 mL of resist at the center of the substrate. Coat the wafer using the following steps:\n- Time: 15 seconds; Speed: 500 r.p.m.; Acceleration: 200 r.p.m./s\n- Time: 30 seconds; Speed: 3500 r.p.m.; Acceleration: 300 r.p.m./s\nSoftbake:\n- Bake the coated wafer at 65 \u00b0C on a preheated hotplate for 5 minutes.\n- Increase the temperature of the hotplate to 95 \u00b0C and bake the wafer for additional 30 minutes.\n- After a total of 35 minutes, turn off the hotplate and let the wafer cool down to 75 \u00b0C while still on the hotplate.\n- Remove the wafer from the hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.\nExposure:\n- Measure the energy density (mW/cm2) of the UV lamp at a wavelength of 365 nm.\n- Load the mask and the wafer into the mask aligner and align them.\n- Expose the photoresist until an exposure dose of 260 mJ/cm2 is reached.\nPost-exposure bake:\n- Bake the exposed wafer at 65 \u00b0C on a preheated hotplate for 5 minutes.\n- Increase the temperature of the hotplate to 95 \u00b0C and back the wafer for additional 12 minutes.\n- After a total of 17 minutes, remove the wafer from the hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.\nDevelopment:\n- Develop the wafer in a Petri dish for 15 minutes. Move manually to improve the circulation of the developer.\n- Move the wafer to a second Petri dish with fresh developer for additional 30 seconds.\nRinse, dry and hardbake:\n- Rinse the wafer and the developed SU-8 structures with IPA.\n- Rinse the wafer with de-ionized water.\n- Dry the wafer with a nitrogen gun.\n- Hardbake the wafer at 150 \u00b0C on a preheated hotplate for 5 minutes.\n- Remove the wafer from the hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.\nSilane coating\n- Plate the wafer with the SU-8 structures next to a glass slide in a vacuum chamber.\n- Add three drops (each about 50 uL) of silane on the glass slide.\n- Close the chamber and start the vacuum pump.\n- Once sufficiently low pressure (less than 100 mbar) is reached, turn off the vacuum pump and let silane distribute inside the chamber for 30 minutes.\n- Remove the wafer from the vacuum chamber and bake it on a hotplate at 120 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\n- Remove the wafer from the hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.\nPDMS casting\n- Mix curing agent and pre-polymer with a weight ratio of 1:10 in a disposable cup for 5 minutes.\n- Place the wafer in a Petri dish inside a vacuum chamber.\n- Cover the wafer with the PDMS and apply a vacuum for 30 minutes to degas the polymer and ensure proper molding of the SU-8 structures. Bleed the vacuum occasionally to accelerate the process and to prevent PDMS from overflowing the Petri dish.\n- Cure the PDMS by placing the Petri dish containing the mold and the degassed polymer in an oven and bake it for 1 hour at 80\u00b0C.\n- Remove the Petri dish with the cured PDMS from the oven and let it cool down to room temperature.\nFinal steps\n- Cut the PDMS and peel it off the silicon wafer. If necessary, punch the connectors using a biopsy punch. For 3D access to the manipulated specimen (see associated publication), cut the fabricated PDMS channels perpendicularly.\n- Clean the PDMS, especially the side containing the microchannels, with transparent adhesive tape.\n- Place the PDMS (microchannels facing upwards) next to a glass slide in a plasma asher.\n- Expose the glass slide and the PDMS to oxygen plasma for 30 seconds.\n- Bring the exposed surfaces in contact to chemically seal the structures.\n- Fix a piezoelectric transducer used for subsequent acoustic excitation on the glass slide near the PDMS structure using a suitable glue, e.g., two-component epoxy."
