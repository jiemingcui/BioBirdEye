            "content": "<p>As the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerates around the world, many low- and middle-income countries are still struggling to access the diagnostic tests they desperately need to control the disease. Moreover, passive protection methods such as masks and hydro-alcoholic gels are the first means of defence to avoid chaotic spread of the virus among the population. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a protocol that was taken into consideration in many national legislations.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In France, at the beginning of the pandemic, we applied this protocol to fabricate several dozens of litres of hydro-alcoholic mixture at our institute and the contents of ethanol or isopropanol in grams per grams of solution was determined by&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>H quantitative NMR (qNMR). If the contents of alcohols in liquids gels can be approximatively measured using a simple alcohol-meter, this technic is less appropriate for viscous liquids containing gelling agents. We report here a method of ethanol content measurement using&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>H quantitative NMR (<sup>1</sup>H qNMR). Our intention is to remind the scientific community of this well-known technic.</p>"

Data Points (acquired): 64 K. NS=64. Relaxation delay: D1=60s.\u00a0Acquisition Time: 4s.
