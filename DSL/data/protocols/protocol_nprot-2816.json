            "content": "The anti-HER1 mAb panitumumab \\(Vectibix) is a fully human mAb approved by the FDA for the treatment of EGFR-expressing colorectal cancers.1,2 Currently, it is being evaluated in patients with other types of EGFR-expressing cancers, such as breast, lung, head and neck, renal and ovarian. Zirconium-89 has emerged as a promising positron emitting radionuclide for diagnostic immuno-PET imaging because of its longer half-life \\(78.4 h), which provides a close match to the biological half-life of an intact mAb.3-7 89Zr can be labeled with mAbs via desferrioxamine B chelate \\(Figure 1) resulting in high radiochemical yield and purity.7-11  Recent preclinical studies showed that 89Zr-labeled panitumumab is a promising quantitative PET biomarker of EGFR-expression.10,11 89Zr-panitumumab microPET/CT showed very high uptake to EGFR-expressing tumor and correlated strongly with EGFR-expression levels \\(Figure 2).10 Initial dosimetry estimates suggest that low-dose 89Zr-panitumumab shows favorable human dosimetry and is expected to be clinically feasible.10  This result has encouraged us to develop clinical-grade 89Zr-panitumumab as a PET biomarker for patient selection and monitoring of EGFR-targeted therapies.\r\n\n\n  Recent published 89Zr-panitumumab synthesis procedures are for preclinical studies only.9-11 In this protocol, we report a stepwise ~ 5 h production procedure of the clinical-grade 89Zr-panitumumab. QC data from three qualification runs are provided to show that this is indeed a clinical-grade product for human administration."

The purity was checked using HPLC to compare its retention time with pure authentic panitumumab \\(Figure 3). The conjugate concentration is determined with the Lowry assay,14 and the DFO to mAb molar ratio is determined with radiometal \\(89Zr)-binding assay15 where a trace amount of 89Zr is mixed with 25 mmol solution of non-radioactive ZrCl4. This freshly prepared conjugate is then used to develop a standard calibration curve \\(Figure 4) with HPLC \\(21 \u00b5g/mL to 210 \u00b5g/mL of DFO-panitumumab) to determine the DFO-protein concentration in every batch. The amount of mAb per dose and the specific activity of the final product can also be measured with this calibration curve.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. Probe Synthesis Protocols\r\n  This protocol is for preparing small scale \\(for one to two patients), clinical-grade 89Zr-panitumumab. The overall process flow of synthesis is shown in Figure 5.

Post-Synthesis QC Test Protocols.\r\n\n\n           All the QC tests, except the sterility test of 89Zr-panitumumab, were carried out according to the USP recommendations as detailed below. After successfully meeting all release criteria, doses are released to physicians for human administration.  A post-release sterility test for every batch must be completed and recorded.16 \r\n\n\n4.3.1. Sampling for Quality Assurance.\r\n\n\ni) Assay the product vial for total radioactivity in a dose calibrator.\r\n\n\nii) Visually inspect for particulates and color. The final drug product in the vial should be clear and colorless, without any visible particulates as per USP chapters 823 and 631 on color and achromaticity.\r\n\n\niii) Complete the integrity test of the sterilizing filter. \r\n\n\na) Place the sterilizing filter on a gas line with a pressure gauge and the outlet of the filter under water. \r\n\n\nb) Increase the gas pressure slowly on the inlet to the filter until a steady stream of bubbles is observed at the filter outlet. \r\n\n\nc) The pressure at which the bubble stream begins is recorded and compared with the manufacturer\u2019s pressure rating \\( \u2265 46 psi) for the filter \\(Pall Corp. Ann Arbor, MI).\r\n\n\niv) After a successful filter integrity test withdraw 300 \u00b5L of the product for further QC and sterility testing.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n4.3.2. Chemical and Radiochemical Purity/Identity by HPLC.\r\n\n\nThe purity of the drug product can be determined by HPLC analysis.\r\n\n\ni) A blank injection must be completed before the sample is injected to make sure there are not any UV and/or radiation impurities from the column or the instrument.\r\n\n\nii) Inject 20 \u00b5L of 89Zr-panitumumab \\(auto-injection preferable).\r\n\n\niii) Integrate all of the UV and radiation responses to obtain the peak areas for the \\[89Zr]-panitumumab.\r\n\n\niv) Perform the reverse correlation from the linear equation of DFO-panitumumab to determine the concentration of \\[89Zr]-panitumumab in the final solution.\r\n\n\nTypically, the final concentration of \\[89Zr]-panitumumab in the \\[89Zr]-panitumumab product to be tested will be < 0.2 mg/mL.\r\n\n\nv) Any other 280 nm UV absorbing chromatographic peaks that elute after 3.0 minutes and before 40 minutes post injection should be integrated individually and shown as a sum of less than \u201c10%\u201d in the final product. Assume that the molar UV absorption coefficients for the unknown contaminants are the same as those for \\[89Zr]-panitumumab, and that the \\[89Zr]-panitumumab standard curve is applicable to the unknown contaminants.\r\n\n\nvi) Integrate all of the radioactive peaks in the chromatogram and calculate the percent of the \\[89Zr]-panitumumab radioactivity in the final product. The radioactivity of \\[89Zr]-panitumumab in the final product should be more than 90%.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4.3.3. Radiochemical Purity by ITLC.\r\n\n\ni) Transfer 0.5 mL of the ITLC eluent to a 15 mL centrifuge tube \\(developing chamber).\r\n\n\nii) Using a micro pipette spot ~1 \u00b5L of sample at the origin of the ITLC strip.\r\n\n\niii) Allow the spot to dry prior to placing it in developing chamber.\r\n\n\niv) Develop the ITLC plate by carefully positioning it in the developing chamber.\r\n\n\nv) Allow the solvent front to migrate at least 90% of the length of the ITLC plate. \r\n\n\nvi) Cut the ITLC plate into the middle and place each part in separate counting tubes.\r\n\n\nvii) Count for radioactivity with an appropriate counter \\(Perkin-Elmer gamma counter).\r\n\n\nviii) Calculate the radiochemical purity \\(RCP) using this equation\r\n\n\n         RCP\\(%) = \\(counts of the bottom / counts of \\(top + bottom)) X 100.\r\n\n\nix) The acceptable RCP should be  \u2265 90%.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4.3.4. pH Determination.\r\n\n\n                Because the product volume is small and the product is radioactive, pH test strips are used instead of a pH meter. \r\n\n\ni) The pH test strips are checked by pipetting pH 5 and pH 7 calibrated commercial pH standards onto individual strips. \r\n\n\nii) The color on the strips must match the pH 5 and pH 7 on the color key supplied with the test strips.\r\n\n\niii) Then the 89Zr-panitumumab is pipetted onto another test strip, and the color is checked against the color key. \r\n\n\niv) The measured pH must be between pH 6 to 8.\r\n\n\n   \r\n\n\n4.3.5. Bacterial Endotoxin Test.\r\n\n\nThe levels of bacterial endotoxin in 89Zr-panitumumab were tested and qualified by PTS Limulus Amebocyte Lysate \\(LAL) Test using Endosafe\u00ae-PTS \\(portable test system) from Charles River Laboratories, as described in USP. All of the bacterial endotoxin levels were < 175 EU per batch for the initial qualification syntheses. This testing required approximately 15 min.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4.3.6. Radionuclidic Identity\r\n\n\nHalf-life determination is utilized for verifying the radionuclidic identity of the final product. The USP radioactivity general chapter, 821, states that the half-life can be \u201creadily determined by successive counting of a given source of a radionuclide over a period of time that is long compared to its half-life.\u201d The variation used here is to count for only a fraction of the half-life of 78 hours. To count a sample for more than 78 hours would reduce the radiopharmaceutical dose by more than half.\r\n\n\nFor the test, an aliquot of the product 89Zr-panitumumab or 89Zr-oxalate \\(used for this synthesis) is counted in an ion chamber or gamma counter at least three times at a particular time-point. The half-life of the radioactivity is determined for each activity measurement using the following equation. \r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nThe half-life test result for 89Zr must be between 74 and 82 hours for the dose to pass. \r\n\n\n            \r\n\n\n4.3.7. Sterility Test\r\n\n\nSterility testing can be performed using the direct inoculation method, which is required by USP after releasing the product for human administration. This test requires ~14 days of time."

Panitumumab is used directly from the purchased drug vial for bioconjugation without any solvent exchange. Both bioconjugation and radiolabeling were performed in a lead shielded laminar flow hood having ISO class 5 environment.\r\n\n\nDuring clinical production, the purified conjugate is analyzed by HPLC before radiolabeling to determine its concentration and purity. A calibration curve \\(Figure 4) developed by using different concentration \\(0.021mg to 0.21mg/mL) of DFO-panitumumab conjugate has been used to determine the concentration of purified protein. Isolated yield and purity of the conjugate are typically >75% and > 98% respectively \\(n = 3). For every batch of 89Zr-panitumumab production fresh conjugate is made. \r\n\n\nIf the HPLC purity of the conjugate is > 90%, approximately 1-1.2 mg of the conjugate is added to the reaction vial for radiolabeling with 89Zr-oxalate.  The typical RCY of the crude product is 80 \u00b1 5 % \\(n = 3). The volume of the purified product is typically 1-2 mL and the volume of the formulated 1.5 mCi dose is ~ 5.0 mL. Process flow of the whole synthesis is shown in Figure 5. \r\n\n\nTable -1 shows the composition of the final product.  89Zr-panitumumab is the only active ingredient in the final product. The drug is intravenously injected into the subject in a solution of < 10 mL preservative-free 0.9 % saline \\(USP). The drug product solution is stored at 2-8 \u00b0C in a gray, butyl septum-sealed, sterile, pyrogen-free glass vial with an expiration time of 48 h. The injectable dose of 89Zr-panitumumab for the initial clinical study will be < 1.5 mCi with a specific activity > 1.5 mCi/mg \\( > 220 mCi/\u00b5mol) at the end of the synthesis. The participant will be injected with < 1 mg of panitumumab drug, which is less than 1/420th of the initial therapeutic dose and less than 7 nmoles of panitumumab, well under the microdose guideline for an exploratory IND of 30 nmoles of a protein drug. In our clinical production, the amount of panitumumab per dose was 400 \u00b1 100 \u00b5g \\(n = 3).\r\n\n\nGentisic acid \\(2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid), an active metabolite of salicylic acid degradation, is used during radiolabeling and in the final product purification mobile phase to protect the protein from radiolysis.17 It is a component of the approved kit for TechneScan  HDP. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nUnless otherwise stated all QC process was performed following USP general chapter <823> for PET radiopharmaceuticals. Table 2 along with Figure 6 \\(HPLC analysis) shows the QC results of three 89Zr-panitumumab production batches. \r\n\n\nAmount DMSO has not been determined in the final product. As per FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for Industry,\u201d ICH Q3C, DMSO is a class 3 solvent that the FDA recommends be limited to less than 50 mg/day in pharmaceuticals.18 Only 7 and10 \u03bcL of DMSO solution of DFO is used in the bioconjugation step. Even if all the DMSO remained in the final product, it is still only a trace amount, which is well below the FDA\u2019s guidance. \r\n\n\n89Zr-panitumumab produced using the method described above has been evaluated in-vitro using an EGFR-expressing MDA-MB-468 cell line following the recent literatures.9-10 Specific binding of 89Zr-panitumumab was 64 to 72% \\(n =3) in cells without pretreatment with panitumumab. In blocking experiment when cells were pretreated with excess panitumumab the 89Zr-panitumumab radioactivity bound to the cells was only 4 to 8% \\(n =3).\r\n\n\nThese results clearly demonstrate that binding was specific."

In this protocol, clinical-grade panitumumab is bio-conjugated with desferrioxamine chelate and subsequently radiolabeled with 89Zr resulting in high radiochemical yield \\(> 70 %, n = 3) and purity \\(> 98%, n = 3). All quality control \\(QC) tests were performed according to USP specifications \\(USP general chapter <823>). QC tests showed that the 89Zr-panitumumab met all specifications for human injection. This protocol describes a step-by-step method for the facile synthesis and quality control tests of 89Zr-panitumumab for medical use.  The entire process of bioconjugation, radiolabeling, and all QC tests take about 5 h.",
