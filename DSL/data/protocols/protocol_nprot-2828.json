            "content": "Vertically aligned nanowire/nanorod arrays are promising building blocks for devices such as photodetectors, light emitting devices, and solar cells.<sup>1-4</sup> Deposition of functional materials into nano-porous templates is a facile \u201cbottom-up\u201d technique for the fabrication of vertically aligned nanowire/nanorod arrays.<sup>5</sup> Due to its simple fabrication process and controllable structures, porous anodic alumina \\(PAA) membrane is widely used as the template material. <sup>6,7</sup> In a conventional process, PAA templates are first formed on top of substrates and then precursor materials are deposition into the templates to form nanowires/nanorods by liquid-phase deposition such as electrodeposition or vapor-phase deposition such as chemical vapor deposition \\(CVD) and atomic layer deposition \\(ALD).<sup>8-10</sup> The materials that form the nanowires/nanorods are either from the electrolyte for electrodeposition or from the vapor for CVD and ALD. Alternatively, the metal substrates beneath the PAA templates could be used as the sources to grow metal oxide nanorods in a process called \u201cthrough-mask anodization\u201d.<sup>11,12</sup> This novel anodization method results in nanorods grown directly from the metal substrate having more intimate contact and better mechanical stability, which is more favorable from the practical point of view. \r\n\n\nIn this protocol, we report the fabrication of barium-doped tantalum nitride \\(Ba-Ta<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub>) following the procedure depicted in the flow diagram in figure 1. Starting with a clean tantalum \\(Ta) substrate, a thin layer of aluminum \\(Al) is deposited on the Ta substrate. The Al layer is first anodized thoroughly to form a PAA mask on top of the Ta substrate. Then, though-mask anodization of the Ta substrate is performed after adjusting the pore size of the PAA mask. During the through-mask anodization process, tantalum oxide \\(Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) formed by anodization is partially filled into the nanochannels of the PAA mask. Vertically aligned Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> nanorod array is obtained after selectively etching the PAA mask. After that, bariumTa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> precursor is loaded on the surface of the Ta2O5 nanorods. Finally, vertically aligned Ba-Ta3N5 nanorod array is achieved by nitriding the Ba-loaded Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> nanorod array in ammonia atmosphere. Using the above-described method, vertically aligned Ba-Ta<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub> nanorod array with uniform diameter and length was fabricated on a large scale. As shown in the associated publication, the Ba-Ta<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub> nanorod array modified with a cobalt-phosphate co-catalyst showed high solar energy conversion efficiency when used as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting. This method can also be applied to other materials \\(e.g., Nb, Zr, Ti) to fabricate vertically aligned nanorod arrays of metal oxides/nitrides for different applications.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2711/original/flow_chart.png?1381197932\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2711/thumbnail/flow_chart.png?1381197932\" > </a>"

            "content": "Ba-doped Ta\n3\nN\n5\nnanorods are fabricated following the steps depicted in the flow diagram in Fig. 1. The detailed procedure is as follows:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. _Preparation of Ta substrate._ Ta sheet is cut into desired size \\(e.g., 1 \u00d7 5 cm\n2\n). The Ta substrate is then cleaned in acetone and isopropyl alcohol by sonication, each for 10 min. Finally, it is dried thoroughly with a N\n2\ngun before loading into the evaporation chamber.\r\n  2. _Deposition of aluminum layer._ Aluminum slug with a weight of\n0.5 g is loaded on a tungsten evaporation boat. Ta substrate is put 30 cm above the aluminum source. The evaporation chamber is pumped to a base pressure of\n3 \u00d7 10\n-3\nPa with a diffusion pump. Aluminum layer is evaporated on the Ta substrate at a rate of 10-30 nm/s. The deposition rate and thickness are measured with a quartz crystal thickness monitor. The thickness of the Al layer deposited on the Ta substrate is about 2-3  \u03bcm. \r\n  3. _Growth of PAA mask._ The Al-coated Ta is anodized in 0.3 M oxalic acid solution at 40 V to form a PAA mask. The electrolyte is cooled with a water bath to a temperature of ~5 \u00b0C and under stirring with a magnetic stirrer. The Al layer is anodized thoroughly until the pores reach the Ta substrate. This can be judged from the anodizing current, which decreases to nearly 0 when the anodization of Al is completed. The variation of the diameter of the nanorods can be achieved in this step. PAA masks with different pore sizes can be fabricated by varying the anodizing voltage. Correspondingly, the composition and concentration of the electrolyte should be changed to achieve a stable anodization. \r\n  4. _Widening the pores of the PAA mask._ The pore size of the PAA mask is about 30 nm. To widen the pore size of the PAA mask, the sample is dipped into a 5% H\n3\nPO\n4\nsolution for 90 s. The temperature of the solution is heated to 60 \u00b0C with a water bath. After etching, the sample is rinsed with pure water. The diameter of the nanorods can also be varied in a certain range by changing the etching time. \r\n  5. _Through-mask anodization._ The Ta substrate coated with PAA mask is then anodized in 0.5 M H\n3\nBO\n3\nsolution at room temperature under stirring. The anodizing voltage is ramped from 0-650 V at a rate of 0.1 V/s and kept at 650 V for 1 h. Caution should be taken with the high voltage used here. The length of the nanorods can be varied by either the anodizing voltage or anodizing time.\r\n  6. _Selective etching of the PAA mask._ After the growth tantalum oxide nanorods by through-mask anodization, the PAA mask is selectively etching with a 5% H\n3\nPO\n4\nsolution. The sample immersed in the H\n3\nPO\n4\nsolution is put into a natural convection oven held at 60 \u00b0C for about 4 h. After that, the sample is thoroughly rinsed with pure water and dried with a N\n2\ngun.\r\n  7. _Loading of Ba precursor._ Ba precursor is loaded on the surface of the tantalum oxide nanorods by dipping the sample into a 0.1 M Ba\\(NO\n3\n)\n2\naqueous solution for about 10 s and then dried with a N\n2\ngun. \r\n  8. _Nitridation._ The tantalum oxide nanorods loaded with Ba precursor are then nitrided in a horizontal tube furnace. The sample is loaded into an alumina boat and placed in the center of the heating zone. The tube is sealed with air-tight flanges. Before heating, the tube is purged with N\n2\nto get rid of air. The furnace is then heated at a rate of 20 \u00b0C/min to 1000 \u00b0C under NH\n3\nflow \\(5 sccm). The temperature is kept at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h and then cooled naturally to room temperature. After that, the tube is purged with N\n2\nagain to get rid of NH\n3\nbefore taking out the sample. Caution should be taken with the hazardous NH\n3\n. The furnace is put into a fume hood in case that there is any leak of NH\n3\n. The gas outlet of the tube furnace is connected to a NH\n3\ntrap consisting HCl solution."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "In this protocol, we describe the detailed procedure for fabrication of barium-doped tantalum nitride nanorod array for application in photoelectrochemical water splitting. Tantalum oxide nanorods are first grown in-situ on a tantalum substrate by a through-mask anodization method using porous anodic alumina as a mask. The tantalum oxide nanorods are then converted into tantalum nitride nanorods by nitridation in ammonia atmosphere. The results reported in the associated publication demonstrate that the barium-doped tantalum nitride nanorods show high solar energy conversion efficiency for water splitting after modifying with a cobalt-phosphate oxygen evolution co-catalyst.",
