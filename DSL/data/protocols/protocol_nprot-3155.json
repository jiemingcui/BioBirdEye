            "content": "Surface plasmon resonance \\(SPR) has been the most widely used optical technique for the real-time and label-free detection of biomarkers based on their specific biomolecular interactions with the bound antibodies \\[1-3].  The main SPR-based instruments are the Biacore systems from GE Healthcare, which have been widely used by researchers during the last two decades for a plethora of applications in academia, healthcare and industry. The conventional microtiter plate \\(MTP)-based IA formats, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA), chemiluminescent IA and fluorescent IA, have prolonged assay duration of several hours, which hinders their application for  rapid diagnostic applications. However, SPR-based IAs provide critically shortened assay duration of just a few minutes. A wide range of Ab immobilization strategies \\[4-10] have been employed for SPR IAs, which employ commercial SPR chips that are pre-functionalized with carboxymethyl dextran, streptavidin, nitriloacetic acid, long chain alkanethiol molecules or lipophilic groups \\[11]. A variety of fragment crystallizable \\(Fc)-binding proteins has been considered \\[9, 12, 13], i.e. protein A, protein G and protein A/G, for the oriented immobilization of capture Ab. However, these Ab immobilization strategies require several hours and involve a large number of process steps.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nWe have developed a novel and highly-simplified Ab immobilization strategy, which leads to the leach-proof binding of capture Ab on the Au-coated SPR chips in just 30 min \\[14]. It only involves the dispensing of Ab diluted in APTES onto a cleaned Au SPR chip, where the carboxyl groups of Abs are bound by ionic binding to the amino groups on APTES molecules that bind simultaneously to the hydroxyl groups on the KOH-treated Au SPR chip. The developed Ab immobilization strategy enables rapid and cost-effective SPR IAs as it obviates the need for multiple process steps, additional chemicals required for Ab immobilization, and the costly pre-functionalized SPR chips. The Ab-bound SPR chips are evaluated for the detection of HFA in buffer, diluted human whole blood and plasma, with respect to bioanalytical performance, reusability and storage stability. The bioanalytical performance of the developed SPR IA procedure will also be compared with our previously-developed and commercial CM5 dextran-based SPR IA procedures \\[9]."

Ninety microliters of this capture anti-HFA Ab solution, with a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g mL\n-1\nin 0.5% APTES, was dispensed onto the Au chip and incubated for 30 min at RT in the fume hood.

The RU values obtained for blanks were subtracted from the RU values for HFA detected in the respective flow cells. \r\n  6.  The SPR-based HFA detection curves were plotted with SigmaPlot software, version 11.2 using standard curve analysis based on a four parameter logistic function.

It is the most sensitive SPR IA procedure for HFA. The intra-assay variability, calculated on the basis of five assay repeats \\(in triplicate) in a single day, was in the range of 1.2-5.8, while the inter-assay variability, determined by five assay repeats \\(in triplicate) on five consecutive days, was in the range of 2.1-8.6. The developed SPR IA had an anti-HFA immobilization density of 182.6\u00b11 ng cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was better than that of our previously developed covalent \\(153.6\u00b11 ng cm<sup>-2</sup>) and commercial CM5 dextran chip based Ab immobilization procedures \\(172.8\u00b11.2 ng cm<sup>-2</sup>) \\[9] \\[**Table 2**]. It detected HFA spiked in diluted human whole blood and plasma \\[**Fig. 2a**] with precision similar to that of conventional HFA sandwich ELISA, as shown by the direct agreement of results in the linear range of 1.2-20 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> \\[**Table 3**]. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe Ab-bound SPR chip was reused for 35 consecutive HFA IAs to detect 5 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> HFA \\[**Fig. 2c**]. The leach-proof binding of anti-HFA capture Ab to the Au SPR chip was observed by the highly reproducible detection of HFA in consecutive IAs on the same chip. The Ab-bound SPR chip was regenerated after each HFA detection cycle by treatment with 20 \u00b5L of 10 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. The storage stability of the anti-HFA Ab-bound SPR chip stored at 4\u00b0C was also determined, where the Ab-bound chip was used after every two weeks for the detection of 5 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> HFA. The Ab-bound chips were highly stable for 2 months with only an 18 % decrease in HFA response after 4 months \\[**Fig. 2d**]. The developed Ab-immobilization strategy is highly cost-effective as it enables the preparation of Ab-bound Au chips in just 30 min before their intended use, which will lead to significantly increased bioanalytical performance, obviating the advanced preparation and storage requirements of the Ab-bound Au sensing chip. It is 5-fold more rapid than the conventional Ab immobilization strategies that are being used for the development of SPR IAs \\[9]. The developed SPR IA procedure is generic and can be used for the detection of biomarkers and other analytes in industrial, healthcare and other bioanalytical settings."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "A rapid and highly-sensitive procedure has been developed for surface plasmon resonance \\(SPR)-based immunoassay \\(IA) for human fetuin A \\(HFA). It employs a highly-simplified antibody \\(Ab) immobilization strategy, which only involves sequentially the dispensing of anti-HFA capture Ab diluted in 1% \\(v/v) 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane \\(APTES) onto a potassium hydroxide \\(KOH)-treated gold \\(Au)-coated SPR chip followed by its incubation for 30 min. The devised Ab immobilization strategy enables the leach-proof binding of capture Ab, resulting in highly reproducible and cost-effective HFA IAs. The  SPR IA detected HFA with a dynamic range, limit of detection, and analytical sensitivity of 0.3-20 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, 0.7 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 1 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The detecting chip can be easily regenerated after each analyis by treatment with 10 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. The Ab-bound SPR chip can be stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 4 months without any significant loss of its functional activity. The developed IA procedure has been employed to detect HFA spiked in diluted human whole blood and plasma. Moreover, the developed SPR IA has high analytical precision as its results are correlated well with those of conventional HFA sandwich ELISA.",
