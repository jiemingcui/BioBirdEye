Add another 1,200 \u03bcL of heated Stringent Wash buffer (200 \u00b5L per library) and mix by vortexing.\n13. Incubate on ThermoMixer for 5 mins at 47\u00b0C, 600 rpm.\n14. Briefly spin to collect at bottom of the tube.\n15. Place in magnetic stand and discard all the liquid when clear (~30 sec).\n16. Remove from the stand and add 1,200 \u00b5L of room temp 1x Wash buffer I (200 \u00b5L per library).\n17. Mix by vortexing for 2 min.\n18. Briefly spin to collect at bottom of the tube.\n19. Place in magnetic stand and discard all the liquid when clear (~30 sec).\n20. Remove from the stand and add 1,200 \u00b5L of 1x Wash buffer II (200 \u00b5L per library).\n21. Mix by vortexing for 1 min.\n22. Briefly spin to collect at bottom of the tube.\n23. Place in magnetic stand and discard all the liquid when clear (~30 sec).\n24. Remove from the stand and add 1,200 \u00b5L of 1x Wash buffer III (200 \u00b5L per library).\n25. Mix by vortexing for 30 sec.\n26. Briefly spin to collect at bottom of the tube.\n27. Place in magnetic stand and discard all the liquid when clear (~30 sec).\n28. Remove from the stand and add 240 \u00b5L of PCR grade water (40 \u00b5L per library).\n** SAFE STOPPING POINT \u2013 Store bead bound DNA at -20\u00baC **\nAmplification of Captured DNA (2 hours)\n1. To the 240 \u00b5L of bead bound DNA add, 300 \u00b5L KAPA HiFI HotStart ready Mix (50 \u00b5L per library) and 60 \u00b5L of POST-LM_PCR Oligo 1&2 (10 \u00b5L per library).\n2. Mix by pipetting and separate across 12 PCR tubes (50 \u00b5L each, two tubes per library)\n3. Amplify DNA using the following conditions (Lid: 108\u00baC):\n- Step 1:\n98\u00b0C (45 sec)\n- Step 2:\n98\u00b0C (15 sec)\n- Step 3:\n60\u00b0C (30 sec)\n- Step 4:\n72\u00b0C (30 sec)\n- Step 5:\nGo to Step 2 for 10 total cycles\n- Step 6:\n72\u00b0C (60 sec)\n- Step 7:\n4\u00b0C (Hold)\n4. Transfer PCR tubes to a magnetic rack and allow solution to clear (~30 sec).\n5. Combine amplification reactions into a single microcentrifuge tube 1,080 \u00b5L of AmpureXP Beads (180 \u00b5L per library).\n6. Mix by pipetting up and down 10 times, allow to bind at room temp for 5 min.\n7. Place on magnetic stand, discard liquid when clear (~5 min).\n8. Add 1,200 \u03bcL of fresh 80% ethanol without removing from magnetic stand. Avoid disturbing beads by running the ethanol down the front of tube.\n9. Allow to sit on the magnetic stand for 30 seconds then remove ethanol.\n10. Repeat ethanol wash with a further 1,200 \u00b5L of ethanol.\n11. Remove ethanol, spin tube on a microfuge and replace on magnetic stand.\n12. Remove residual ethanol with a P10 pipette, taking care not to remove any beads.\n13. Air dry at room temperature on magnetic stand until matt in appearance \u2013 take care not to over dry the beads as this will result in increased DNA losses. Cracks will appear when beads have overdried.\n14. Remove from magnetic stand and re-suspend beads in 105 \u03bcL PCR Grade water.\n15. Incubate at room temperature for 2 min to elute.\n16. Place on magnetic stand and allow beads to clear (~5 min).\n17. Recover DNA by transferring 103 \u00b5L to a new microcentrifuge tube.\n18. Assess DNA size using 1 \u00b5L in a D1000 TapeStation with High Sensitivity reagents.\n19. Quantify Captured 3C DNA using 2 \u00b5L in a Qubit HS reaction.\n** SAFE STOPPING POINT \u2013 Store Amplified Captured DNA at -20\u00baC **\nBiotinylated Oligonucleotide Capture 2 (Double Capture)\n** The total DNA recovered is likely <2 \u00b5g and is therefore treated as a single library for double capture. If over 2 \u00b5g of DNA is recovered treat as two libraries. **\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using total amplified DNA from Capture 1, perform the steps described above for\nHybridisation Reaction\n,\nWash Buffer and Bead Preparation\n,\nBinding of Biotinylated Oligonucleotides\nand\nAmplification of Captured DNA\nas described but treating the reaction as a single library (volumes provided) with the following modifications:\nHybridisation Reaction:\n- Use 0.16 \u00b5L of each TS-HE Index oligo (Step 4)\n- Preheat 7 \u00b5L of oligonucleotide pool (Step 8)\n- Incubate at 47\u00baC for between 18 and 22 hours (Step 13)\nAmplification of Captured DNA:\n- Elute in 55 \u00b5L of PCR grade water (Step 14)\n-\nRecvoer 53 \u00b5L of DNA (Step 17)\n- Assess DNA size 1 \u00b5L in a D1000 TapeStation with standard reagents. (Step 18)\n- Quantify Captured 3C DNA using 2 \u00b5L in a Qubit BR reaction (Step 19).\n** SAFE STOPPING POINT \u2013 Store Amplified Double Captured DNA at -20\u00baC **\nLibrary sequencing.\n1. Using Qubit determined concentration dilute 20 \u00b5L of Double Captured DNA to 10 nM.\n2. Use KAPA Library Quantification Kit with 1:10,000 and 1:20,000 dilutions to determine concentration with size correction.\n3. Using the KAPA determined concentration dilute Double Captured DNA to 4 nM (or Sequence Facility specified concentration).\n4. Sequence using paired-end reads. Gold standard sequencing uses 150 bp reads which enable reconstruction of entire indexed fragments and identification of restriction sites. However, 75 bp paired reads are sufficient for analysis and can be considerably cheaper."

The addition of high-throughput sequencing adaptors prior to enrichment allows for multiplexing of replicates and comparison samples. This method is an improvement on the previous NG Capture-C<sup>1</sup> method in that modifications have been made to the <em>in situ</em> 3C method to improve nuclear integrity (Nuclear 3C). Additionally, capture has been optimised to viewpoint complexity through titration, maximising on target sequence specificity.
