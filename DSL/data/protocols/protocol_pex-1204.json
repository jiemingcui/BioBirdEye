            "content": "<p>In this protocol we describe a simple and robust relative quantification method of proteins in cultured cells through chemiluminescence imaging of cells (CLIC). CLIC can be used for relative quantification of complement activation on human cells and bacterial cells, the expression level of membrane receptor proteins, and the shedding of membrane proteins. CLIC can be used to rapidly investigate the efficacy of RNA knockdown at the protein level. Furthermore, it can be used to quantify the relative levels of cytosolic, nuclear, and membrane proteins and quantify differences in protein localization between cytosolic and nuclear compartments.</p><p>In certain instances, using CLIC was advantageous over commonly used immunoassays. Assays that use fluorescence detection methods often suffer from a high background signal due to cell or reagent autofluorescence that makes quantification of subtle changes difficult in adherent cells.</p><p>The minimal manipulation of cells in CLIC helped to yield faster and more reproducible results compared to our previous experience with Western blots and dot blots, likely because CLIC does not use several steps that can adversely affect reproducibility</p>"

The AOI used is typically a circular selection about 60% of the size of the well in the image, placed approximately in the center of each well to avoid the well edges as they are known to cause noise and variability in cell-based assays.\n- The signal in each well is quantified using the\nMeasure\ncommand under the\nAnalyze\ntab. The AOI selection is then dragged to the next well to ensure that the size remained constant, and this process is repeated for each well. The AOI can be saved for future experiments using the \u201cROI manager\u201d tool in ImageJ. The\nIntegrated density\nvalues for each well is then recorded."

We first employed this method to quantify complement activation in cultured mammalian cells, and to quantify membrane protein expression, shedding, binding and internalization. Moreover, through specific membrane permeabilization we were able to quantify both cytosolic and nuclear proteins, and their translocation.&nbsp;We validated the CLIC quantification method by performing parallel experiments with other quantification methods like ELISA, qPCR, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The workflow of the immunoassay was found to be advantageous in certain instances when compared to these quantification methods. Since the reagents used for CLIC are common to other immunoassays with no need for specialized equipment, and due to the good linearity, dynamic range and signal stability inherent to chemiluminescence, we suggest that this assay is suitable for both small scale and high throughput relative protein quantification studies in whole cells</p>",
