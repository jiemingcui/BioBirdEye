            "content": "<p>Organoids are self-organising 3D tissue models comprising stem and differentiated cells<sup>1</sup>. Organoid monocultures typically contain one major cell class (e.g. epithelial) and can be co-cultured with heterotypic cell-types (e.g. mesenchymal<sup>2</sup> or immune cells<sup>3</sup>) to model cell-cell interactions <em>in vitro</em>. When compared with traditional 2D cell culture, organoids more accurately represent their parental tissue and are powerful models for studying multicellular diseases such as cancer<sup>4</sup>.</p><p>While culturing organoids has become increasingly widespread, methods to analyse cell-type specific phenotypes in organoids are limited. Mass cytometry (MC, also known as cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF)) uses heavy metal-conjugated antibodies to measure &gt;35 proteins in single cells<sup>5</sup>. Although MC is traditionally used for high-dimensional immunophenotyping, MC can also measure PTMs in heterocellular systems (e.g. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)<sup>6</sup> and tissue<sup>7</sup>). Here we report a protocol to perform cell-type specific analysis of post-translational modification (PTM) signalling networks in organoids and organoid co-cultures using MC.</p><p>In addition to high dimensional single-cell PTM measurements, a major advantage of MC is its ability to perform multiplexed barcoding of experimental variables. Unfortunately, commercially available Palladium-based barcodes cannot bind organoids <em>in situ</em> as they react with Matrigel proteins commonly used in organoid culture. This means organoids must be removed from Matrigel and dissociated separately before using Pd barcoding. To overcome this, we developed Thiol-reactive Organoid Barcoding <em>in situ</em> (TOB<em>is</em>) to enable high-throughput multivariate single-cell organoid signalling analysis in a single tube.</p><p>Taken together, our protocol demonstrates how traditional MC workflows can be modified to measure cell-type and cell-state specific signal transduction in organoids in a high-throughput multiplexed manner (Figure 1).</p>"

Despite their increasing popularity, no existing methods are suitable for cell-type specific analysis of post-translational modification (PTM) signalling networks in organoids. Here we report a multivariate mass cytometry (MC) protocol for single-cell analysis of cell-type specific PTM signalling in organoid monocultures and organoids co-cultured with stromal and immune cells. Thiol-reactive Organoid Barcoding <em>in situ</em> (TOB<em>is</em>) was developed to facilitate high-throughput comparison of signalling networks between organoid cultures. Taken together, our protocol enables high-throughput multivariate PTM signalling analysis of healthy and cancerous organoids at the single-cell level.</p>",
