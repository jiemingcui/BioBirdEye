        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>On-chip glycan biosynthesis is an effective strategy for preparing useful complex glycan sources and for preparing glycan-involved applications simultaneously. However, current methods have some limitations when analyzing biosynthesized glycans and optimizing enzymatic reactions, which could result in undefined glycan structures on a surface, leading to unequal and unreliable results. In this work, a novel glycan chip was developed by introducing a pH-responsive i-motif DNA linker to control the immobilization and isolation of glycans on chip surfaces in a pH-dependent manner. On-chip enzymatic glycosylations were optimized for uniform biosynthesis of cancer-associated Globo H hexasaccharide and its related complex glycans through stepwise quantitative analyses of isolated products from the surface. Successful interaction analyses of the anti-Globo H antibody and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with on-chip biosynthesized Globo H-related glycans demonstrated the feasibility of the structure-switchable DNA linker-based glycan chip platform for on-chip complex glycan biosynthesis and glycan-involved applications.</p>",
