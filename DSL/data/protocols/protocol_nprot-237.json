            "content": "**Abstract**\r\n\n\nTransient transfection is a useful procedure by which to address the function of regulatory elements and transcription factors involved in gene regulation. However, primary mouse T cells are difficult to transfect. This protocol describes optimized conditions for transient transfection of primary mouse T cells with luciferase reporter constructs under the control of regulatory elements from the murine _Ifng_ locus using the Amaxa Nucleofector &#xAE;. Primary CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>0, T<sub>H</sub>1, and T<sub>H</sub>2 effector T cells were generated in vitro, then transfected with pGL-Firefly luciferase constructs under the control of the _Ifng_ promoter and candidate regulatory elements along with a thymidine kinase- luciferase transfection control. Following a brief rest period, cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies, IL-12 plus IL-18, or a combination of these stimuli and then were processed for dual luciferase reporter assays. While this protocol was designed to evaluate the effects of distal regulatory elements on _Ifng_ expression, it could be adapted for use in other gene expression, signaling, and biochemical analyses of primary mouse T cell function. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Introduction**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRegulation of the immune response at the molecular level requires the closely controlled expression of genes, some of which must be silenced, while others must either be expressed constitutively or only in response to specific stimuli. Thus, proper regulation of gene expression, particularly cytokine secretion, is essential to assure that protective immunity is generated and maintained and inflammatory and autoimmune disorders are avoided. The expression of cytokine genes by T cells is largely governed by exogenous factors. These factors can lead to the rapid and transient induction of cytokines, influence the subset of cytokines a T cell is capable of expressing, or both. These effects are mediated by transcription factors that bind to the promoter and to additional regulatory elements, including enhancers, silencers and boundary elements, which may lie nearby or 50 kb or more upstream or downstream of the gene they help to regulate<sup>1</sup>. The identification of cytokine gene regulatory elements, the transcription factors that bind to them, and the epigenetic processes and modifications that modulate transcription factor binding and thereby influence cell fate and function, are an important area of contemporary immunological investigation<sup>2</sup>. \r\n\n\nNowadays, discovery of distal regulatory elements typically begins with the use of complementary bioinformatic and epigenetic analyses to detect evolutionarily conserved sequences and chromatin and DNA modifications, respectively, that are commonly associated with regulatory elements<sup>3</sup>. These candidate regions must then be evaluated to determine if they do regulate gene transcription, and, if so, if their function is affected by or dependent on specific stimuli and transcription factors. Whereas certain functions of transcriptional regulatory elements can only be detected in situ or in stably transfected or transduced cells, classical enhancer activity can be detected through the use of reporter constructs that are transiently transfected into appropriate cell types. Long-term human or mouse T cell lines are commonly employed for this purpose, because they can be easily, rapidly and reproducibly transfected and studied. It is also possible to determine the effects of specific transcription factors on enhancer activity by co-transfection of reporter constructs with constructs directing the constitutive expression of signaling molecules or transcription factors not present in that cell line. However, receptors involved in T cell activation and the signaling pathways and transcription factors downstream of these receptors may not be expressed or act in these long-term cell lines in a manner that is truly representative of primary T cells. Self-inactivating retroviral-based or lentiviral-based systems have been used to introduce reporter constructs that become stably integrated into the genome of primary mouse and human T cells<sup>4</sup>. However, such constructs may be subjected to integration site effects that can mask or modify the enhancer function or lead to confusion as to whether the effect observed reflects enhancer, silencer or boundary element activity. Furthermore, the development of vectors and production of retroviral stocks can be laborious and poses biohazardous risks. \r\n\n\nThe recent introduction of Amaxa&#xAE; nucleofection technology has allowed efficient and rapid gene transfer into resting and activated primary human and mouse T cells<sup>5,6</sup>. In this study, we describe an optimized nucleofection procedure for the transient transfection of luciferase reporter constructs driven by regulatory elements from the murine interferon-&#x3B3; \\(_Ifng_) locus into primary mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>0, T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells and for determination of their effects on expression following stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies, IL-12 plus IL-18 or the combination of these stimuli. This method should be applicable or adaptable to studies of transcriptional or translational regulation, transcription factor function and signaling in primary murine T cells."

After 1-2 days, the cells will show blast morphology.\r\n\n\n2 Expand cells by splitting 1:2 to 1:4 every 2-3 days in medium containing a 1x solution of the appropriate cytokines. Completely resuspend cells by gently pipetting up and down, using plugged tips to prevent contamination. For the first split, also include neutralizing anti-cytokine antibodies as appropriate for the type of effector T cells being prepared; omit the antibodies but include the cytokines in subsequent splits. Maintain cells at a density of 0.5 - 2.5 x 10\n6\n.\r\n\n\n3 Collect cells for transfection at day 6 \u2013 8 by gently pipetting each well\u2019s contents up and down to resuspend the cells. Wash wells with medium to capture all cells.  Starting with na\u00efve T cells purified by flow cytometry, the purity is generally >99% effector T cells with <0.5% NK1.1\n+\nor MHC class II\n+\ncells.  \r\n\n\n4       \u25b2 CRITICAL STEP To increase the effect of stimulation on reporter expression, wash cells once in medium lacking IL-2 and allow cells to rest prior to transfection. Collect cells by centrifuging at 450xg for 7 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. Resuspend cells in medium lacking IL-2 and repeat centrifugation. Culture cells in tissue culture flasks at 37 \u00b0C in IMDM containing 10% FCS, penicillin and streptomycin for 5 hours prior to transfection, then place the flask on ice for 1 hour. CD4\n+\nT\nH\n0 and T\nH\n1 cells are more prone to apoptosis and often loose viability when washed out of IL-2; if this occurs, do not wash them but do place on ice for 20 minutes prior to transfection. \r\n\n\n5 \u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Prepare Amaxa\u00ae Mouse T Cell Nucleofector Medium and Mouse T Cell Nucleofector solution as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Aliquot 5.0 \u03bcg TK-pRL plus 20.0 \u03bcg of the desired _Ifng_-pGL constructs into a sterile 1.5mL eppendorf tube per transfection. Prepare 1.5 mL cell recovery medium per transfection by adding 10 \u03bcL/mL Amaxa\u00ae Component B to Mouse T Cell Nucleofector Medium and aliquoting 1.5mL/well of a 24-well plat. Equilibrate this plate at 37 \u00b0C, 5%CO2 for at least 30 minutes prior to performing the transfection. Prewarm Mouse T Cell Amaxa\u00ae Nucleofector Solution to room temperature 15-20 minutes before transfection. \r\n\n\n6 \u25b2CRITICAL STEP Count and verify the viability of cells by standard procedures. Optimal culture conditions and cell viability of >90% are necessary prior to transfection; use of overgrown or dying cells results in very low transfection efficiency and viability.  Centrifuge cells at 90xg for 10 minutes at room temp.

If it is necessary to transfect multiple cell types or a large number of samples, leave aliquots of cells on ice prior to adding Amaxa\u00ae Nucleofector Solution.\r\n\n\n8 Using a standard micropipette and plugged tips, gently transfer 100 \u03bcL cell suspension into Eppendorf tubes containing 25 \u03bcg DNA \\(5.0 \u03bcg TK-pRL plus 20.0 \u03bcg of the desired _Ifng_-pGL constructs), mix, then transfer into Amaxa\u00ae Nucleofector cuvette, being careful to avoid air bubbles and to place the suspension all the way to the bottom of the cuvette chamber. \r\n\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP The transfection efficiency and magnitude of expression vary with cell density and amount of DNA. In our studies, 5x10\n6\ncells and 25\uf020\uf06dg total DNA were optimal \\(Fig. 1a). \r\n\n\n9 Select the Amaxa \u00ae Nucleofector X-01 program, insert the cuvette, and press X to transfect.\r\n\n\n10 Immediately add ~500 \u03bcL of pre-warmed medium from the equilibrated 24-well plate \\(see step 5) to the cuvette with the supplied micropipette and gently remove cells to plate, being careful to remove all debris and volume. Press X to reset Amaxa \u00ae Nucleofector and repeat for remaining samples.\r\n\n\n11 Allow cells to recover at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 4 hours. During the last 15 minutes, prepare the 48-well plates \\(see REAGENT SETUP) to be used for stimulation. Aspirate PBS containing anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 and add 100 \u03bcL of Amaxa \u00ae Nucleofector Medium to wells to be used for unstimulated or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 samples. For wells to be used for IL-12 plus IL-18 stimulation or a combination of IL-12, IL-18, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation, add 100 \u03bcL of Nucleofectordium containing 5 \u03bcg/mL IL-12 plus 5 \u03bcg/mL IL-18.  \r\n\n\n12  Stimulation of cells. Gently mix cells using a standard micropipette and plugged tips, avoiding air bubbles. Transfer 345 \u03bcL to each of four wells \\(one each for unstimulated, anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, IL-12 plus IL-18, or all stimuli combined) for stimulation. \r\n\n\n13 Harvest cells 3-6 hours after stimulation by washing wells with 1 mL PBS, transfer cell suspension into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and spin at 1400 rpm for 5 min, 4 \u00b0C.  \r\n\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Luciferase activity varies with time following nucleofection, and in our hands peaks 3-6 hours after stimulation \\(Fig. 1b).\r\n\n\n14 Gently flick cell pellet and resuspend cells in 50 \u03bcL 1x Passive Lysis Buffer \\(PLB; supplied by Dual-Luciferase Assay kit) mixing briefly by gentle vortexing. Set samples on a rocker for 10 minutes \\(~60rpm) at room temperature. Quick spin to collect sample contents at bottom of the tube. PAUSE POINT Sample lysates may be stored for >1 month at -80 \u00b0C without loss of activity. \r\n\n\n15 Perform luciferase analysis as directed by the Dual-Luciferase kit manufacturer\u2019s protocol using 20 \u03bcL of cell lysate."

An example of the results obtained is shown in Fig. 2: Expression of these constructs was low in T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, which do not express IFN-&#x3B3;, under all conditions. In contrast, these _Ifng_ reporter constructs were expressed in CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>0 T cells \\(and T<sub>H</sub>1 T cells, not shown). Expression was enhanced by _Ifng_CNS-6 in CD8 and CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>0 T cells in response to anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, whereas _Ifng_CNS-22 enhanced expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>0 T cells in response to IL-12 plus IL-18.  \r\n\n\nUsing the parameters described in this protocol, we routinely observed light units on the order of 0.5-2.0 x 10<sup>4</sup> for TK-pRL controls and 10<sup>4</sup> to &gt;10<sup>6</sup> light units for _Ifng_-pGL3 constructs, depending upon the cells and stimulation conditions. As a negative control, we also included cells transfected with a pGL3 plasmid lacking a promoter, which typically yielded ~100-2000 light units. Stimulation of cells typically led to increases in TK-pRL activity up to 4-fold compared to unstimulated cells, making this a reasonable but imperfect control. If one normalizes cytokine reporter activity to this value, the actual induction tends to be underestimated. Alternatively, one can carefully aliquot equivalent numbers from each transfection such that the numbers of cells for each stimulation condition is the same, then normalize the results to unstimulated TK-pRL values for that transfection.\r\n\n\nIt may be useful to initially optimize transfection conditions using the pMAX-GFP construct \\(included with the Amaxa&#xAE; kit) to determine transfection efficiency and cell viability. We found GFP<sup>+</sup> 7-AAD<sup>-</sup> cells to constitute between 30-50% of total cells transduced, however the extended expression of GFP precludes its use in optimizing time points for luciferase analysis. If difficulties with cell viability are an issue, we recommend examining transfected cells under the microscope and/or assessing viability using dye-exclusion at all stages of the protocol to determine which stage is creating problems. Although we have optimized the cell numbers and conditions, amounts of DNA, and time points for use of Amaxa&#xAE; nucleofection for reporter assays in primary mouse T cells, use of this protocol in other assay systems may require additional changes in parameters."
