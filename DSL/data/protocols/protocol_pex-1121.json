            "content": "<p>Ruminants obtain nutrients from feeds for milk, meat, and wool production. But nutrient utilization from feeds implies the activity of different digestive processes, in which rumen microorganisms play a central role in. When ruminant consumes forage or concentrates, the carbohydrate and protein molecules enter the rumen and these are initially catabolized by the action of enzymes secreted by rumen bacteria, fungus, and protozoa. The final products of this catabolic process are the volatile fatty acids (VFA) or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The VFA are short carbon chain compounds that are produced during the fermentative degradation of feeds in the rumen. These are absorbed by the rumen wall and converted by anabolic processes into carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids being these largely deposited in milk and meat.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Generally, formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, iso-butyric, 2-methyl butyric, valeric, isovaleric, caproic, and caprylic acids are considered as VFA. However, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids are the main VFA produced during the feed rumen fermentation. Hence, the objective of this protocol is to describe a method to extract, identify, and quantify VFA in rumen fluid samples, using RP HPLC-DAD as a quantification technique.</p><p><br></p>"

From a fistulated cattle, sheep or goat, collect at least 50 mL of rumen fluid filtering it through three cheese-cloth layers. Make the collection in a 39 \u00baC pre-warmed thermos and transport it to the laboratory as soon as possible.\nNotes: 1) to thermos pre-warming, fill it with pre-warmed water at 39 \u00baC, and empty it at the moment to collect the rumen fluid. 2) the rumen fluid sample must be composed of rumen fluid from three rumen regions: front and half of the ventral sac, and from cranial sac (Zijderveld et al., 2011).\n2. In the laboratory, add 2 mL of the previously filtered rumen fluid to a 5 mL centrifuge tube.\n3. Add 2 mL of extraction solution (see section 3.1) to the centrifuge tube plus rumen fluid and stir it in vortex using medium speed for 30 s.\n4. Freeze the sample at -20 \u00baC until analysis.\nNote: if the sample is immediately analyzed after collection, refrigerate the tube at 4 \u00baC for 30 min to allow rumen fluid protein precipitation.\n5.2 Extraction of volatile fatty acids from rumen fluid:\n1. On the day of analysis, thaw samples at room temperature (20 \u00baC).\n2. Centrifugate samples at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature (20 \u00baC).\n3. Recover the liquid phase after centrifugation using a plastic syringe and filter the liquid phase through a 0.45 \u03bcm PES membrane filter. Collect the volume in a plastic tube of 4 mL.\n5.3 Chromatographic analysis:\n5.3.1. Chromatographic analysis of the\ncalibration curve:\n1. Prepare the calibration curve as described in 3.3.2 item of reagents section..\n2. Analyze each point of the curve by RP HPLC-DAD.\n3. Identify and integrate the resulting chromatographic peaks.\n5.3.2 Chromatographic analysis of the ruminal fluid samples:\n1. Place 500 \u03bcL of the final extract in a chromatographic vial.\n2. Add 500 \u03bcL of Milli-Q water.\n3. Analyze by RP HPLC-DAD.\n4. Identify and integrate the resulting chromatographic peaks.\n5.3.3 Chromatographic conditions:\n- Column temperature: 30 \u00baC.\n- Injection volume: 20 \u03bcL.\n- Stationary phase: Hypersil GOLD C18 column (dimensions: 150 x 4.6 mm) equipped with Hypersil GOLD C18 guard column (dimensions: 10 x 4 mm).\n- Working wavelength: 210 nm.\n- Mode: gradient, constant flow: 0.750 mL/min (see Table 2 in supplementary files).\nNote: According to the literature findings, the most suitable column for VFA chromatographic separation by HPLC-DAD is an ion-exchange column. However, the Hypersil GOLD C18 column allows an efficient VFA separation, except for butyric and iso-butyric acids. This condition may constitute a limitation of the Hypersil GOLD C18 column use for VFA determination. However, considering that the concentration of iso-butyric acid is significantly lower than that of butyric acid, a good estimation of butyric acid can be obtained."

Therefore, in case of future optimizations of this method, the use of a mobile phase 100% aqueous must be avoided.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Depending on the rumen fluid sample volume used, the quantities of reagents to be used during the VFA extraction can be proportionally reduced without significant effects on the chromatographic separation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Verify that the concentration of the internal standard in the final rumen samples and the calibration curve point tends to be the same, assuming that internal standard remains constant after VFA extraction.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>In ruminant animals, volatile fatty acids (VFA) or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are derived from the protein and carbohydrate fermentation by rumen microorganism. Hence, the VFA determination in rumen fluid allows the evaluation of the nutritional quality of a diet, as well as its potential impact on the chemical composition of ruminant milk and meat. Thus, we developed a protocol to extract, identify, and quantify acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, and caproic acids in ruminal fluid samples using RP-HPLC-DAD. Despite literature findings had shown that the most suitable column for VFA chromatographic separation under HPLC-DAD is an ion-exchange column, our protocol showed that a C18 column also allows an efficient VFA separation of the aforementioned acid, except for butyric and iso-butyric acids. This condition may constitute a limitation of the Hypersil GOLD C18 column use for VFA determination. However, considering that the concentration of iso-butyric acid is significantly lower than that of butyric acid, a good estimation of butyric acid can be obtained.</p><p><br></p>",
