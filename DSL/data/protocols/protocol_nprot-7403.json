            "content": "We establish a database of oligos supporting DNA FISH probes design, and targeting a substantially larger fraction of the human genome than the available databases. Most importantly, we create a large resource of validated DNA FISH oligo probes and probe design tools\u2014which we name iFISH\u2014that can be freely used by individual researchers, as well as diagnostic laboratories, to visualize multiple regions of the genome at high resolution, as well as to design probes in regions currently not covered by our repository. We provide a user-friendly web interface \\(http://ifish4u.org) that can query available curated databases of oligo sequences, and design probes of variable size and number along the genome of interest. Furthermore, we describe a continuously expanding repository of probes\u2014now containing 380 probes in multiple colors targeting 380 loci on all the human autosomes and chrX\u2014which we make freely available to the community. We expand the repertoire of colors that are typically used in DNA FISH, and show that iFISH probes can simultaneously visualize six distinct genomic loci on the same chromosome, labeled with different fluorescent dyes. Lastly, we show that iFISH probes can be used as chromosome-spotting probes to visualize multiple pairs of chromosomes in the same cells, and propose an analytical approach to quantify the extent of intermingling between heterologous chromosomes."

Features 1\u20133 are used for single probes, whereas all the four features are used to design multiple probes on the same chromosome. Dashed boxes indicate examples of genomic windows, within the region of interest, each containing the same number of oligos (vertical bars), but with suboptimal size (1), homogeneity (2), or centrality (3). In contrast, the central dashed window, with oligos marked in red, represents the window of choice, which best satisfies all the four features. (b) Cumulative distribution of the distances between consecutive oligos in the human 40-mers database used to design all the iFISH probes described in this work.

(2) The oligo-pool is dispensed into n 96-well plates, depending on the total number of probes (p) and colors per probe (c). (3) In each well, the oligos corresponding to the same probe are selectively amplified using a probe-specific PCR primer pair that incorporates the T7 promoter sequence (T7) and a specific color adapter sequence (C), and (4) successfully amplified probes are purified and linearly amplified by in vitro transcription (IVT). (5) Purified IVT products are reverse transcribed (RT), (6) RNA is hydrolized, and finally (7) single-stranded DNA is purified to obtain ready-to-use probes.",

At present, there is a lack of free resources of DNA FISH probes and probe design tools, which can be readily applied. Here, we describe iFISH, an open-source repository currently comprising 380 DNA FISH probes targeting multiple loci on the human autosomes and chromosome X, as well as a genome-wide database of optimally designed oligonucleotides and a freely accessible web interface \\(http://ifish4u.org) that can be used to design DNA FISH probes. We individually validated 153 probes in our repository, and harnessed our probe repository to quantify the extent of intermingling between multiple heterologous chromosome pairs, showing a much higher extent of intermingling in human embryonic stem cells compared to fibroblasts. In conclusion, iFISH is a versatile and expandable resource, which can greatly facilitate the use of DNA FISH in research and diagnostics.",
