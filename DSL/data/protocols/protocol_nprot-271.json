            "content": "To demonstrate the ability of microbial factor-activated PPO activity in clearing the invading pathogen _in vivo_, we infected horseshoe crabs in the presence or absence of PO-specific inhibitor, PTU<sup>1</sup> or kojic acid<sup>2</sup>.  A comparison of the remnant bacterial load under these conditions should help to clarify the specific contribution of PO, if any, to the antimicrobial activity.   Previously, it was reported that HMC/PPO is activated by host intracellular factors released through LPS-dependent degranulation of hemocytes.  To avoid provocation of PPO by such cellular components and to unequivocally demonstrate that the microbial factor-activated PPO contributes to the antimicrobial defense, Gram-positive bacteria lacking LPS were used to avoid LPS-induced hemocyte lysis.  To this end, the _S. aureus_ laboratory strains, PC1839 \\(V8 protease-producing) and AK3 \\(V8 protease inactive mutant), were injected into the animals."

            "content": "1. Culture the Gram-positive bacterial strains under pyrogen-free condition as described in protocols #4 and #5. \r\n  2. Adjust the bacterial population to 10\n6\n-10\n7\ncfu/ml with pyrogen free 3% NaCl \\(isotonic to the horseshoe crab hemolymph). \r\n  3. Inject the horseshoe crab intracardially with 10\n5\n-10\n6\ncfu bacteria /100 gram body, using #23 needle.  \r\n  4. At 30 min post injection, collect hemolymph from the horseshoe crab by cardiac puncture using #18 needle. \r\n  5. Immediately after collection, remove the hemocytes by centrifuging the hemolymph at 150 x g for 10 min at room temperature. \r\n  6. Quantify the remnant bacterial load in the extracellular milieu by applying 100 \u03bcl of the cell-free hemolymph \\(from step 5) to the nutrient agar plate and incubate at 37 \u00b0C overnight. \r\n  7. In order to confirm the contribution of PO activity in the bacterial clearance, include 5 mM PTU or 5 mM kojic acid in the bacterial injection to block _in vivo_ PO activity, if any."

            "header": "Anticipated Results",
            "content": "As shown in Figure 7, at 30 min post-injection, the remnant bacterial load in the cell free hemolymph \\(injected without PTU or kojic acid) is less than 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/ml.  Co-injection of PTU or kojic acid with the bacteria results in significantly higher bacterial load of the extracellular-protease positive strains such as _S. aureus_ PC1839.  In contrast, the clearance of the extracellular-protease-negative strains such as AK3, is unaffected by PTU or kojic acid."

Injection of the _S. aureus_ laboratory strains, PC1839 and AK3, which are active V8 protease-positive and -negative, respectively into the horseshoe crab at 105 cfu/100 gram body weight, in the presence or absence of 5 mM PTU. At 30 min post injection, the remaining bacterial load in the hemolymph was measured. The protease-positive strain which specifically evoked the ROS-production by HMC/PPO, is in turn killed effectively. However, co-injection with PTU inhibited the HMC/PPO activity, and allowed the bacteria to remain viable in the host. On the other hand, the clearance of the V8-inactive strain was unaffected by PTU. This is probably due to the antimicrobial effects of parallel PO-independent mechanisms (see main text for further explanations).",
