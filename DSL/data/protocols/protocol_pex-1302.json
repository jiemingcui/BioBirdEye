            "content": "1\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare a 2% agarose solution in deionised water.\u00a0Microwave until agarose has fully melted.\n2\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use a pair of plastic gel plates, consisting of a front and back plate (Figure 1A).\u00a0The back plate contains the buffer reservoir for electrophoresis (see Figure 1B for side-view of the plate).\u00a0It is important that the plates originated from the same cassette, as the plastic connectors break differently when the plates were separated).\n3\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash plates with warm water (note that hot water will deform the plastic), dry with paper towels.\n4\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Join plates together and lay them flat on an elevated surface such as a pipette tip box (Figure 2A).\u00a0\u00a0This will allow easy access to the gaps between the plate, without lifting them up.\n5\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using masking tape, seal the bottom slit of the front plate.\u00a0Fold over the ends of the tape so that it can easily be peeled off prior to electrophoresis (Figure 2B).\n6\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, place a second piece of masking tape near the top just under the well numbers (Figure 2C).\n7\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flip the gel cassette over and firmly pull tape around and tape on opposing plate, such that the two plates are firmly held together by the tape (Figure 2D). \u00a0Rub fingers firmly on the tape.\n8\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wait for agarose solution to cool to approximately 80\no\nC.\u00a0Take up agarose solution with a 1\u00a0ml pipette, avoiding intake of air bubbles.\u00a0Place the pipette tip on the left side of the gel, and between the two plates close to the gap, as indicated in the Figure 3A.\u00a0Slowly expel the solution in-between the gap. \u00a0During this procedure do not lift up the cassette, instead it must be kept horizontal at all time. \u00a0If parts of the gap are still not filled with agarose, move along the gap and inject agarose solution where needed.\nHot (80\no\nC) agarose solution will allow it to 1) flow easily deeply between the thin gaps, leading to a better seal; and 2) to naturally flow along the seam without needing to move the pipette tip.\n9\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keeping the plate in its horizontal position, repeat procedure, but starting on the right side of the cassette.\n10\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keeping the plate in its horizontal position, repeat the same procedure, but starting from the bottom gap (Figure 3B).\u00a0Since this gap is more narrow, make sure the agarose solution is still hot, to allow it to flow easily into the gap.\u00a0Slowly run the pipette tip back and forth along the gap, and ensure the gap is fully filled with agarose.\u00a0Pipette slowly to avoid air bubbles entering the gap.\u00a0If air bubbles did enter the gap, they can be removed with an empty 200\u00a0\u00b5L tip attached to a pipette, by sucking up the air bubbles.\n11\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do not lift the cassette or move it, until the agarose has solidified.\n12\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place the cassette upright in a peg rack, as shown in Figure 4A.\u00a0Best results are achieved when the cassette fits firmly in the rack.\u00a0This will apply slight pressure on the plates, pressing them against each other, ensuring the acrylamide will not leak out.\n13\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place medium sized bulldog clips on either side of the cassette as indicated in Figure 4B.\n14\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keeping the cassettes in the rack, lift the rack and tilt at a 45\no\nangle as illustrated in Figure 5A below.\u00a0Take up hot agarose solution with a 1\u00a0ml pipette.\u00a0Place the pipette tip on right inside edge of the cassette.\u00a0Allow the agarose solution to flow down along the inside edge and to the bottom.\u00a0Tilt the rack and cassette back to the horizontal position, allowing the agarose solution to continue flowing along the bottom inside edge of the cassettes.\u00a0Repeat on the left side (Figure 5B).\u00a0Repeat the process, until there is at least 2-3mm of agarose along the bottom inside edge of the cassettes (Figure 5C).\u00a0This will require approximately 1.5\u00a0ml of agarose solution in total).\u00a0Allow the agarose to set.\n15\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Test the sealed cassette for any potential leaks by squeezing water into the cassette using a wash bottle (Figure 6A).\n16\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fill up cassette with water (Figure 6B).\u00a0Leave for a few minutes to give time for the sighting of any leaks.\n17\nAfter confirmation that the cassette is note leaking, discard the water by carefully inverting the rack over a sink while holding the cassette in place.\u00a0Place the rack with the cassette back on the bench.\u00a0Insert a strip of blotting/filter paper between the plates to remove any remaining water (Figure 6C).\u00a0Several pieces of absorbent paper may be needed to remove all water.\u00a0Note that stiffer absorbent paper such as Whatman paper works best.\n18\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cassette is ready for pouring the SDS-PAGE gel.\u00a0For pouring a gradient gel see reference (1).\u00a0Cassettes will generally require 15mls of acrylamide to fill.\u00a0Plates that have been used several times may have become bent slightly, meaning that slightly more volume is needed for pouring the gel.\n19\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place the comb into the cassette, between the plates, as far as it can be pushed in (Figure 7A).\u00a0Place the comb slowly between the plates and holding it initially at an angle, this well help to not trap any air bubbles between the teeth of the comb.\n20\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fix the comb to the plates using two large bulldog clips, to hold the comb firmly in place (Figure 7B).\u00a0It is important to place the bulldog clips just above the teeth of the comb as indicated in the image, to prevent acrylamide being squeezed out of the cassette.\n21\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let the acrylamide set, this will take approximately 1.5 hours.\n22\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove cassette from the rack, remove the bull clips, but Do NOT remove the tape.\u00a0Wet a paper towel with water and wrap around the cassette, then wrap tightly in plastic wrap (Figures 8A-8C).\u00a0Store in fridge over night to allow for full polymerisation and best results.\u00a0Gels can be stored for up to two weeks at 4\no\nC with little effect on protein separation.\n23\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before running the gel, carefully remove the tape covering the slit of the front pate, but do NOT remove the second piece of tape holding the plates together.\u00a0Carefully insert the gel cassette into the electrophoresis unit.\u00a0Add running buffer to the top reservoir.\u00a0Add running buffer in the bottom chamber only until the meniscus is approximately 1cm above the slit in the front plate.\u00a0It is important that not more running buffer is added to the bottom reservoir, as otherwise ions could freely move through the sides of cassettes\n24\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After running the gel, remove the tape and separate the plates.\u00a0Remove the SDS-PAGE gel for further processing.\u00a0Remove and discard any excess acrylamide gel and agarose, wash plates in warm water, dry with paper towels, and store until next use."
