            "content": "The environmental conditions to which living organisms are exposed may change constantly. Therefore, animals possess a variety of mechanisms that adapt their physical or behavioral activities to such changes. Temperature causes direct biochemical changes within organisms and is a critical factor for their survival. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits temperature-responsive phenomena. The induction of dauer larvae and thermotaxis are well-known responses to high temperature 1,2,3, but it is not well understood how C. elegans habituates to cold temperature. C. elegans is unable to proliferate below 10\u00b0C but previous reports suggested the existence of cold tolerance in this species. Cold tolerance enabling survival at 2\u20134\u00b0C for a number of hours is regulated by phospholipid saturation and the aging pathway 4,5. Xiao et al reported that culture temperature affects the longevity of cold-sensitive TRPA-1-defective mutants 6. Recently, we reported that light- and pheromone-sensing ASJ neurons detect temperature and control cold-tolerance through insulin signaling 7. This implies that a pair of sensory neurons promotes cold-temperature resistance in other tissues. Here we present our assay for cold tolerance following prior temperature experience. \r\n\n\nAn established state of cold tolerance can be changed within three or more hours incubation at a new temperature, suggesting that the cultivation temperature is stored somewhere and can be replaced within a few hours of a new experience 7. Here we also describe our cultivation-temperature-shifted cold-tolerance assay."

Place two adult nematodes \\(P0) onto the NGM in 60-mm diameter plates, which are the assay plates in the following procedure. \r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Incubate the assay plates at each experimental temperature for 8\u201312 h, until the P0 adults have laid about 100 eggs.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Remove all P0 adults to synchronize the stages of nematodes\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Incubate the assay plates until the progeny develop to the adult stage at their respective temperatures, e.g.: \r\n  15\u00b0C, cultivate for 144\u2013150 hours\r\n\n\n20\u00b0C, cultivate for 85\u201390 hours\r\n\n\n25\u00b0C, cultivate for 60\u201365 hours\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5. Place the assay plates containing fully matured\u2014but not old\u2014adult animals directly onto ice for 20 min. Note that assay plates must be sealed by Parafilm with only half of their agar bottoms in contact with the ice.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Place the assay plates into a plastic container with a lid and transfer them to the refrigerator at 2\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Incubate the assay plates at 2\u00b0C for 48 h.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. Store the assay plates at 15\u00b0C overnight.\r\n  \r\n\n\n9. Count the numbers of dead and live adult animals, and calculate the survival rate. \r\n  \r\n\n\nAt least nine assays \\(steps 1 to 9) are performed for each strain. Calculate mean survival rates and the standard error of the mean \\(SEM) for the data from more than nine assay plates.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIf the growth rates of mutants are slower or faster than wild types, shift the laying day \\(step 2) to synchronize the start of the cold exposures of wild-types and mutants.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIf the mutants have the constitutive dauer-formation phenotype \\(daf-c), cultivate them at 15\u00b0C from eggs to L4 larvae and then cultivate them overnight at the designated temperature \\(20\u00b0C or 25\u00b0C) before cold shock. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCultivation temperature-shifted cold-tolerance assay \r\n\n\nIn this assay, the animals are cultivated from eggs to young adults or L4 larvae at one temperature and then cultivated at a second temperature for some hours before cold shock. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Cultivate C. elegans to adults under well-fed conditions. Place two adult animals \\(P0) onto the NGM in 60-mm diameter plates, which are the assay plates in the following procedure. Three assay plates of the same strain are used for one assay. \r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Incubate the assay plates at the first temperature for 8\u201312 hours until the P0 adults have laid about 100 eggs.    \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Remove all P0 adults to synchronize the stages of the nematodes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Incubate the assay plates until the progeny develop into young adults or adults at the first temperature, e.g.: \r\n   15\u00b0C, cultivate for 132\u2013150 h\r\n\n\n20\u00b0C, cultivate for 72\u201390 h\r\n\n\n  25\u00b0C, cultivate for 52\u201365 h\r\n\n\nIf step 5 involves 18 h incubation above 20\u00b0C, it is best to move to this step when the animals are L4 larvae.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5. Transfer the assay plates to another incubator kept at the second temperature and incubate for several hours \\(e.g., 0, 3, 5, 8, or 18 h).\r\n    \r\n\n\n6. After incubation at the second temperature, place the assay plates on ice for 20 min. Note that the assay plates must be sealed by Parafilm with only half of their agar bottoms in contact with the ice.  \r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Place the assay plates into a plastic container with a lid and transfer them to the refrigerator at 2\u00b0C\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. Incubate the assay plates at 2\u00b0C for 48 h.\r\n  \r\n\n\n9. Store the assay plates at 15\u00b0C overnight.\r\n  \r\n\n\n10. Count the numbers of dead and live adult animals, and calculate the survival rate.\r\n  \r\n\n\nRepeat the assay three times with three assay plates each and calculate the mean survival rates and the standard error of the mean \\(SEM) for the data from more than nine assay plates."

In Japan, these phenotypes change markedly in the rainy season. If the cold tolerance of mutant strains is changed, the cold-shock temperature or cold-shock time should be changed, e.g., 2\u00b0C to 3.5\u00b0C and/or 24 hr to 72 hr.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIf 35-mm diameter NGM plates are used, the number of eggs laid by P0 adults should be reduced to fewer than 100 and the egg-laying time shortened, or the P0 numbers per assay plate reduced.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTemperature stability is is markedly different among different models of incubator or refrigerator. We frequently monitored the internal temperature of the incubators and refrigerator using an HA-100K digital thermometer \\(Anritsum, Japan)."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Temperature is a critical and continuous environmental factor that directly affects biochemical processes within organisms. Animals may habituate to environmental temperature change using a range of mechanisms. To investigate mechanisms of temperature habituation, we exposed Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes to a temperature of 2\u00b0C, which is much colder than their normal growing temperature \\(approximately 10\u201328\u00b0C) and we evaluated their survival rate in recovery from this cold shock. The survival rate after cold shock was different between animals grown at 15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C, suggesting that C. elegans exhibits temperature-habituation-linked cold tolerance. Here we show in detail two protocols: a standard cold-tolerance assay after cultivation at constant temperature; and a multistep temperature-shifted cold-tolerance assay. \r\n\n\n\\(T.U. & A.O. contributed equally to this work.)",
