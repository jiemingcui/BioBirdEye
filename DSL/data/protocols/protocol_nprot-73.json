            "content": "Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis is an actively researched area in medical genetics. The discovery of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma has opened up a new source of fetal genetic materials for molecular analysis<sup>1</sup>. The finding that circulating fetal RNA, in addition to fetal DNA, released by the placenta<sup>2</sup>, is present in maternal plasma has further increased the potential diagnostic applications of plasma nucleic acid analysis. We have recently demonstrated that allelic ratio analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms \\(SNPs) present in such circulating placental mRNA would allow us to determine, with high sensitivity and specificity, the aneuploidy status of the fetus noninvasively<sup>3</sup>. Here, we describe in detail a protocol for carrying out such an analysis, including the blood processing steps, RNA extraction from plasma, RNA quantification by real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction \\(QRT-PCR), and allelic ratio determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry \\(MALDI-TOF MS). In this protocol, the _PLAC4_ gene, which is located on chromosome 21, is used as an example<sup>3</sup>. The allelic ratio determination for _PLAC4_ in maternal plasma can therefore be used as a noninvasive method for detecting trisomy 21."

Transfer plasma into clean polypropylene tubes carefully, so as not to disturb the cellular layer. \r\n\n\n3) Recentrifuge the plasma at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Carefully transfer the supernatant into clean polypropylene tubes without disturbing the cell pellet.

Store the plasma-Trizol LS mixture at -80 \u00b0C until RNA extraction.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP Inadequate vortexing would lead to a lower yield of plasma RNA.\r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT RNA in plasma-Trizol LS mixture is stable at -80 \u00b0C for up to three years\n5\n.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Plasma RNA extraction**\r\n\n\nPerform all procedures and keep all reagents at room temperature unless otherwise specified.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP To minimize the introduction of RNase during the extraction, clean the laboratory bench and the equipment with RNase Away \\(Molecular BioProducts, cat. no. 7000) before each extraction. Use sterile RNase-free plasticware for the procedures.\r\n\n\n5) Thaw 6.4 mL of the plasma-Trizol LS mixture prepared in step 4.\r\n\n\n6) For every 1.6 mL of the plasma-Trizol LS mixture, add 320 \u00b5L of chloroform. Shake the tubes vigorously by hand. Centrifuge the mixture at 12,000g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n7) Transfer the upper aqueous layer into new tubes. The volume of the aqueous layer is approximately 850 \u00b5L for each 1.6 mL of the plasma-Trizol-LS mixture. Add 457 \u00b5L of absolute ethanol per 850 \u00b5L of the aqueous layer and mix by inverting the tubes. \r\n\n\n8) Apply 700 \u00b5L of the mixture into an RNeasy minicolumn.

Centrifuge the column at 16,000g for 1 min.\r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT Store the extracted RNA at -80 \u00b0C if DNase I digestion cannot be carried out immediately.\r\n\n\n16)Perform DNase I digestion\r\n\n\na)Add 4.8 \u00b5L each of 10x DNase I Reaction Buffer \\(provided with the DNase I) and DNase I to 48 \u00b5L of plasma RNA on ice. Mix by pipetting. Incubate the reaction for 15 min at room temperature.\r\n\n\nb)Add 4.8 \u00b5L of EDTA \\(provided with the DNase I). Incubate the reaction for 10 min at 65 \u00b0C and then place the tubes on ice.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP DNase I digestion is performed to eliminate any contaminating genomic DNA, which if present, could adversely affect the observed allelic ratio.\r\n\n\n17) Store the RNA at -80 \u00b0C\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Real-time quantitative RT-PCR \\(QRT-PCR)**\r\n\n\nPlasma RNA sample is firstly quantified with QRT-PCR\n2\nfor _PLAC4_ mRNA. This is to ensure the amount of RNA in the sample is sufficient for the subsequent RNA allelic ratio determination\n3\n.\r\n\n\n18) Prepare a calibration curve by serially diluting the synthetic DNA oligonucleotide into the following concentrations: 2.5 x 10\n6\n, 2.5 x 10\n5\n, 2.5 x 10\n4\n, 2.5 x 10\n3\n, 2.5 x 10\n2\n, 25 and 2.5 copies/\u00b5L.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP Preparation of the calibration curve is a step which has a high contamination risk since each of the constituent dilutions contains a very high concentration of short synthetic oligonucleotide specifying the amplicon. Thus, it is crucial to prepare the calibration curve in an area that is physically separated from the PCR preparation site.\r\n\n\n19) Prepare QRT-PCR reaction master mix with the following components \\(for one reaction):\r\n\n\n5 \u00b5L of 5x TaqMan EZ Buffer\r\n\n\n3 \u00b5L of manganese acetate\r\n\n\n0.75 \u00b5L of dATP\r\n\n\n0.75 \u00b5L of dCTP\r\n\n\n0.75 \u00b5L of dGTP\r\n\n\n0.75 \u00b5L of dUTP\r\n\n\n1 \u00b5L of forward QRT-PCR primer\r\n\n\n1 \u00b5L of reverse QRT-PCR primer\r\n\n\n0.5 \u00b5L of TaqMan MGB probe\r\n\n\n1 \u00b5L of r_Tth_ DNA Polymerase\r\n\n\n0.25 \u00b5L of AmpErase uracil N-glycosylase \\(UNG)\r\n\n\n5.25 \u00b5L of water\r\n\n\n20) Aliquot 20 \u00b5L of the master mix into each well. \r\n\n\n21) Perform duplicated reactions for each sample, no template control \\(NTC) and calibration curve. To the sample wells, add 5 \u00b5L of RNA sample. To the NTC wells, add 5 \u00b5L of RNase free water.\r\n\n\n22) Cover the wells with optical caps.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP To prevent calibration curve-associated contamination, cap both the samples and the NTC wells immediately before adding the calibration curve.\r\n\n\n23) For the calibration curve prepared in step 18, add 5 \u00b5L of the seven concentrations of synthetic oligonucleotide individually into the calibration wells. Cover the wells with optical caps.\r\n\n\n24) Perform QRT-PCR as follows:\r\n\n\n50 \u00b0C for 2 min\r\n\n\n60 \u00b0C for 30 min\r\n\n\n95 \u00b0C for 5 min\r\n\n\n45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 60 \u00b0C for 1 min\r\n\n\n25) Calculate RNA concentration according to the following equation:\r\n\n\n_**C**_ = _**Q**_ x \\(_**V\nRNA\n**_ / _**V\nPlasma\n**_)\r\n\n\nin which _**C**_ represents _PLAC4_ mRNA concentration in plasma \\(copies/mL), _**Q**_ represents _PLAC4_ mRNA concentration of the extracted RNA \\(copies/\u00b5L), which is determined by the sequence detector, _**V\nRNA\n**_ represents total volume of the DNase-treated RNA after extraction \\(62.4 \u00b5L), _**V\nPlasma\n**_ represents volume of plasma used for extraction \\(1.6 mL).  \r\n\n\nFor the NTC, no amplification signal should be observed.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP If the RNA concentration of a particular sample is very low, extra care should be taken when interpreting the result of that sample in the subsequent RNA allelic ratio analysis. It has been shown that when the starting RNA amount of a sample is very low, the chance of inaccurate allelic ratio measurement might increase\n3\n. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Reverse transcription**\r\n\n\n26) Add 4.8 \u00b5L of gene-specific primer and 9.6 \u00b5L of dNTP mixture to 48 \u00b5L of the DNase-treated plasma RNA prepared in step 16. Incubate the mixture at 65 \u00b0C for 5 min and then place on ice.\r\n\n\n27) Add 19.2 \u00b5L of 5x cDNA Synthesis Buffer \\(provided with the ThermoScript enzyme), 4.8 \u00b5L each of dithiotreitol \\(DTT) \\(provided with the ThermoScript enzyme), RNaseOUT and the ThermoScript enzyme into the reaction. Immediately place the mixture in a thermocycler that has been pre-heated at 55 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP Minimize the handling time between ice and 55 \u00b0C incubation to reduce RNA secondary structure formation and non-specific priming by the ThermoScript enzyme. \r\n\n\n28) Incubate the reaction at 55 \u00b0C for 60 min, follow by 85 \u00b0C at 5 min.\r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT Store the cDNA at -20 \u00b0C if PCR amplification cannot be carried out immediately.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**PCR amplification**\r\n\n\n29) Prepare PCR reaction with the following components \\(for one reaction). \r\n\n\n12 \u00b5L of 10x PCR Buffer \\(containing 15 mM MgCl\n2\n)\r\n\n\n2 \u00b5L of dNTP mixture\r\n\n\n4 \u00b5L of forward PCR primer\r\n\n\n4 \u00b5L of reverse PCR primer\r\n\n\n0.8 \u00b5L of HotStar _Taq_ polymerase\r\n\n\n77.2\uf020\u00b5L of water\r\n\n\n100 \u00b5L of synthesized cDNA from step 28\r\n\n\n\\(Since the cDNA product contains significant amount of magnesium salts, and constitutes half of the PCR reaction volume, no additional MgCl\n2\nand less 10x PCR buffer should be added in order to maintain an optimal salt concentration for the PCR reaction)\r\n\n\n30) To control for any PCR product contamination, prepare a NTC tube according to the components in step 29. Replace the cDNA with 100 \u00b5L of water.\r\n\n\n31) Perform PCR as follows:\r\n\n\n95 \u00b0C for 7 min\r\n\n\n55 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 40 s, 56 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min\r\n\n\n72 \u00b0C for 3 min\r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT Store the PCR product at -20 \u00b0C if base extension reaction cannot be carried out immediately. The PCR product can be stored for at most three months. Prolonged storage may adversely affect the RNA allelic ratio.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Base extension reaction**\r\n\n\n32) Dephosphorylate any remaining dNTPs in the PCR product with shrimp alkaline phosphatase \\(SAP). This is to prevent their incorporation in the subsequent base extension assay. \r\n\n\na)Add 0.34 \u00b5L of hME buffer and 0.6 \u00b5L of SAP to 25 \u00b5L of the PCR product and mix thoroughly.\r\n\n\nb)Incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 40 min, followed by 85 \u00b0C for 5 min.\r\n\n\n33) Prepare base extension reaction with the following components \\(for one reaction):\r\n\n\n0.4 \u00b5L of ddATP/ddCTP/ddTTP/dGTP mixture\r\n\n\n1.68 \u00b5L of extension primer\r\n\n\n0.036 \u00b5L of Thermosequenase\r\n\n\n6.884 \u00b5L of water\r\n\n\n5 \u00b5L of SAP-treated PCR product from step 32\r\n\n\n34) Perform the reaction as follows:\r\n\n\n94 \u00b0C for 2 min\r\n\n\n100 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 5 s, 52 \u00b0C for 5 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 5 s\r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT Store the base extension product at -20 \u00b0C if MALDI-TOF MS analysis cannot be carried out immediately.

Table 1 shows the molecular masses of the two base extension products corresponding to the respective _PLAC4_ SNP alleles.\r\n\n\n For a heterozygous sample, the relative amounts of the two SNP alleles are represented by the ratio of the peak areas for the two corresponding base extension products \\(Figure 1), which are determined by the SpectroTYPER software \\(Sequenom). The SNP allelic ratio is then calculated by dividing the relative amount of the higher-mass allele, allele G, to the relative amount of the lower-mass allele, allele A. As shown in Figure 2, the SNP allelic ratios of trisomy 21 samples are deviated from those of the euploid samples. For NTC, only a primer peak should be observed in the mass spectrum."
