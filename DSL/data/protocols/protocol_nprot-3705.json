            "content": "Acrylamide \\(AA) is a chemical compound extensively used in the industry for the production of polyacrylamide polymers. Increased interest in acrylamide has been noted since 2002, when the Swedish National Food Agency in collaboration with scientists from the Stockholm University published for the first time data on the high content of acrylamide in high-carbohydrate products undergoing thermal processing. \r\n\n\nAcrylamide is rapidly absorbed and, owing to its very good solubility in water, rapidly distributed to various tissues. It is metabolised through two main metabolic pathways: epoxidation to glycidamide and glutathione conjugation to mercapturic acids. The conversion of acrylamide to glycidamide, its main metabolite, is catalysed by an enzyme of cytochrome P450 \\(isoenzyme CYP2E1). Both acrylamide and glycidamide form adducts with haemoglobin. Acrylamide adducts with N-terminal valine in the haemoglobin molecule \\(AA-Hg) are considered as  biomarkers of long-term exposure to acrylamide. Higher levels of AA-Hg were found in smokers and persons exposed to acrylamide at work. Additionally, glycidamide forms a number of DNA adducts, this is why glycidamide is considered to play a critical role in the carcinogenic action of acrylamide.  \r\n\n\nBoth compounds are conjugated with glutathione and further metabolized to form mercapturic acids: acrylamide to N-acetyl-S-\\(2-carbamoylethyl)-L-cysteine \\(AAMA) and glycidamide to N-acetyl-S-\\(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-L-cysteine \\(GAMA) and N-acetyl-S-\\(3-amino-2-hydroxy-3-oxopropyl)-cysteine. Acrylamide and glycidamide metabolites in the form of mercapturic acids are excreted in the urine. \r\n\n\nSeveral papers published so far presented the results of studies on urinary levels of mercapturic derivatives of acrylamide and glycidamide in humans. The possibility of use of the mercapturic derivatives levels for the assessment of exposure to acrylamide from food and tobacco smoke was also presented."
