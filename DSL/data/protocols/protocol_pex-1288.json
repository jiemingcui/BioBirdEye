Best results are achieved using the 0.5 mL 30 kDa MWCO spin filter (\nMillipore-Sigma\n). A concentration >2 \u00b5M in a volume of 50 \u00b5L yields adequate signal intensity for MS\n1-3\n.\n2.\tFilter is first conditioned by spinning 500 \u00b5L of 150 mM ammonium acetate for 3 mins at 13,000 xg. Upon completion of spin, empty the filter of any remaining liquid.\n3.\tAdd up to 500 \u00b5L of Nuc sample into the filter \u2013 topping off with ammonium acetate \u2013 and spin for 5 mins at 13,000 xg or until sample is concentrated at or below 100 \u00b5L.\n4.\tFor sample desalting, add ammonium acetate up to the 500 \u00b5L mark and spin sample for 5 mins at 13,000 xg. Repeat desalting process 10-15 times for best results.\n5.\tFor final spin, centrifuge for 10 minutes to concentrate sample >2 \u00b5M in <50 \u00b5L.\nNuc-MS\nData Acquisition\n1.\nInstrumentation\n: Given the high mass of Nuc particles, the Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer with Extended Mass Range (QE-EMR) and Q Exactive HF Ultra-High Mass Range (QE-UHMR) instrumentation are best for Nuc-MS analysis. Other instruments with up to 8000 m/z transmission and detection range may also be suited for Nuc-MS.\n2.\tXCalibur QualBrowser 4.0.27.10 (\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n) is used for MS data acquisition.\n3.\tNative electrospray ionization (nESI) can be achieved with commercial Nanospray and Nanospray Flex Ion Sources with a static NSI probe (\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n) as well as a capillary-based ion source as described previously [1].\n4.\tOnce stable electrospray is achieved, the MS\n1\n(intact mass of Nuc particle) can be collected using the following parameters in positive ion mode (QE-EMR ; QE-UHMR):\na.\nInjection time\n: Fixed at 50 ms ; Fixed at 200 ms\nb.\nNumber of microscans\n: 10 ; 10\nc.\nResolution (MS\n1\n)\n: 15,000 at 400 m/z ; 17,500 at 200 m/z\nd.\nUltra-High Vacuum (UHV) Pressure\n: 4 V: 1.65E-9 mBar ; 2-4 V: 7.7E-11 to 1.55E-10 mBar\ne.\nSource Induced Dissociation (SID)\n:\u00a025 V ; 5 V\nf.\nIn-Source Trapping (IST)\n: Not available ; 25 to 50 V\ng.\nHCD trapping energy\n: 10 V ; 0 V\nh.\nCapillary temperatur\ne: 330 \u00baC ; 300 \u00baC\n5. Ejection of histones (MS\n2\n) is achieved with high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) activation of an isolated nucleosome charge state for synthetic Nucs or isolation of the entire charge state distribution for endogenous mononucleosomes. The isolation window using the quadrupole mass filter should be optimized based on heterogeneity of the sample and signal intensity output. The following parameters are recommended once the desired species/population is isolated (QE-EMR ; QE-UHMR):\na.\nInjection time\n: Fixed at 500 ms ; Fixed at 500 ms\nb.\nNumber of microscans\n: 10-20 ; 10-20\nc.\nResolution (MS\n2\n)\n: 120,000 at 400 m/z ; 100,000 at 200 m/z\nd.\nUltra-High Vacuum (UHV) Pressure\n: 2 V: 7.11E-10 mBar ; 2 V: 7.7E-11 mBar\ne.\nSource Induced Dissociation (SID)\n:\u00a05 V ; 0 V\nf.\nIn-Source Trapping (IST)\n: Not available ; 25 to 50 V\ng.\nHCD trapping energy\n: 120 V ; 5-30 V (Normalized Collision Energy, NCE)\n6. For histone ejection at the source in preparation for pseudo-MS\n3\n, the following parameters are recommended (QE-EMR ; QE-UHMR):\na.\nInjection time\n: Fixed at 100-300 ms ; Fixed at 100-300 ms\nb.\nNumber of microscans\n: 2 ; 2\nc.\nResolution (MS\n2\n)\n: 120,000 at 400 m/z ; 100,000 at 200 m/z\nd.\nUltra-High Vacuum (UHV) Pressure\n: 2 V: 7.11E-10 mBar ; 1-2 V: 4.67E-11 to\n7.7E-11 mBar\ne.\nSource Induced Dissociation (SID)\n:\u00a050-150 V * ; 0 V\nf.\nIn-Source Trapping (IST)\n: Not available ; 150 to 200 V\ng.\nHCD trapping energy\n: 0 V ; 0 V (Normalized Collision Energy, NCE)\nh. *Note that histone ejection at the source using SID on the QE-EMR is not as efficient as IST on the QE-UHMR. A 50-150 V SID range is provided given that some DNA fragmentation occurs which must be balanced with histone ejection.\n7. For fragmentation of source-ejected histones (MS\n3\n/ pseudo-MS\n3\n), the desired histone proteoform charge state is manually isolated using the quadrupole mass filter with an isolation window of 5-10\nm/z\n. The following parameters are recommended once stable signal is achieved for the isolated species (QE-EMR ; QE-UHMR):\na.\nInjection time\n: Fixed at 1000-2000 ms ; Fixed at 1000-2000 ms\nb.\nNumber of microscans\n: 10 ; 10\nc.\nResolution (MS\n2\n)\n: 120,000 at 400 m/z ; 100,000 at 200 m/z\nd.\nUltra-High Vacuum (UHV) Pressure\n: 2 V: 7.11E-10 mBar ; 2 V: 7.7E-11 mBar\ne.\nSource Induced Dissociation (SID)\n:\u00a050 V ; 0 V\nf.\nIn-Source Trapping (IST)\n: Not available ; 150 to 200 V\ng.\nHCD trapping energy\n: 120 V ; 30-40 V (Normalized Collision Energy, NCE)\nData Analysis\n8. MS\n1\nand MS\n2\ndata at medium-resolution (not isotopic) can be deconvoluted and visualized using MagTran 1.03 [2] (mass range: 15-300 kDa; max no. of species: 10-15; S/N threshold: 1; mass accuracy: 0.05 Da; charge determined by: charge envelop only) and UniDec 3.2.0 [3] (Charge Range: 20 \u2013 50, Mass Range: 15 \u2013 300 kDa, Sample mass every 0.5 Da).\n9. Isotopically resolved MS\n2\ndata can be analyzed using Xtract (Signal-to-Noise threshold ranging from 1-30,\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n) and mMass 5.5.0 (\nwww.mmass.org\n).\n10. MS\n3\ndata can be processed using Xtract (Signal-to-Noise threshold ranging from 1-30,\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n), which provides the monoisotopic masses for the detected fragment ions. mMass 5.5.0 (\nwww.mmass.org\n), ProSight Lite 1.4 [4] (precursor mass type: average; fragmentation method: HCD; fragmentation tolerance: 10-15 ppm), and TDValidator 1.0 [5] (max ppm tolerance: 25 ppm; cluster tolerance: 0.35; charge range: 1-10; minimum score: 0.5; S/N cutoff: 3; Mercury7 Limit: 0.0001; minimum size: 2) are used to assign recorded fragment ions to the primary sequence of the subunits.\n11. For careful fragmentation analysis, ProSight Lite and TDValidator are used to analyze spectra in medium throughput to assign and validate\nb\nand\ny\nfragment ions to the histone sequences, and for generating a p-score. mMass generates\nin silico\na list of theoretical fragment ions for a target proteoform and is thus used to interrogate individual fragment ions within a spectrum not identified by TDValidator or ProSight Lite.\n12. Unexplained mass shifts (\u0394\nm\n) observed at the MS\n1\n, MS\n2\n, and MS\n3\nlevels were manually interrogated using the UNIMOD database (\nhttp://www.unimod.org/modifications_list.php\n) as a reference for candidate modifications."
