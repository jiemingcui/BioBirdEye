            "content": "MicroRNAs \\(miRNAs) are 21~22 nucleiotide \\(nt) small regulatory RNAs in plants and animals. They are processed from their precursors, as short hairpin-loop structures within the long endogenous primary transcripts \\(pri-miRNA)<sup>1</sup>. MiRNAs can be incorporated in RNA-Induced Silencing Complexes \\(RISCs), and bind to target transcripts for post-transcriptional regulation based on partial or near complete base-pairing. In animals, miRNA target genes are usually repressed at translation. In plants miRNA target transcripts are mainly cleaved at miRNA complementary sites, followed by transcript degradation<sup>2</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMiRNA-mediated down-regulation is an important gene regulation mechanism in animals and plants, and its mechanisms of action and application in genetic modification have been investigated and explored<sup>2,3,4</sup>. Sequence alteration of miRNA and its complement \\(miRNA**) did not disturb miRNA biogenesis as long as the hairpin-loop structure in the precursor was unaffected<sup>5</sup>. Therefore, the native miRNA and miRNA** can be substituted by artificially designed sequences to produce artificial miRNA \\(amiRNA). Similar to miRNA, amiRNAs are processed from primary transcripts \\(pri-amiRNA) of amiRNA transgenes in transgenic plants, animals and human cell lines, and may cause knock-down of any transcript that contains an amiRNA complementary site<sup>5,6,7,8</sup>. Compared to other gene knock-down techniques such as antisense RNA or RNA interference \\(RNAi), amiRNA sequence may be more specific because its sequence is very short, and therefore, it can be designed to minime the targeting of possible homology sequence within un-targeted transcripts. This is especially ture for organism with whole genome sequence or whole transcriptome information<sup>6</sup>. In addition, the amiRNA induced gene knock-downs are dominant negative regulators, and can exhibit single or multiple mutant phenotypes \\(depending on the number of targeted genes) in a single generation after transformation<sup>6</sup>. AmiRNA-based platforms are also better suited for therapeutic gene knock-down in animals<sup>9</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor successful application of the amiRNA technique, it is important to be able to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of amiRNA expression, which is important to guarantee the efficiency and specificity of amiRNA mediated target gene knock-down. At present, the most widely adopted method for detecting amiRNA is Northern blot hybridization<sup>6</sup>. However, this method is labor intensive and needs large amount input RNA, such as 10 ug total RNA for abundant miRNA. Northern blot hybridization also requires hazardous or expensive reagents for probe preparation, such as radioisotopes, or lock nucleic acids \\(LNA)<sup>10</sup> to increase the  sensitivity and specificity in detecting small sized RNAs.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn a previous report, we presented a poly\\(A)-tailing-based reverse transcription PCR \\(RT-PCR) method for analyzing small RNAs, such as miRNA<sup>11</sup>. This method is also useful for analyzing amiRNA and has additional advantages over northern hybridization and other RT-PCR approaches. Poly\\(A) tailing-based RT-PCR requires only 200ng total RNA for cDNA synthesis, and each PCR reaction uses cDNA amounts to less than 1ng total RNA. Poly\\(A) tailing-based RT-PCR can be conducted the same way as 3\u2019 rapid amplification of cDNA Ends \\(RACE) to obtain partial sequences of amiRNA 3\u2019, and thus, can validate the accuracy of an expressed amiRNA<sup>12</sup>. Previous reports have shown size heterogeneity of expressed amiRNAs differing only at their 3' ends<sup>6</sup>. Although other RT-PCR methods, such as primer extension based RT-PCR<sup>13</sup>, and loop RT-PCR<sup>14</sup> have been developed for small RNAs detection, these methods can not provide sequence information for tested small RNAs. Finally, poly\\(A) tailing-based RT-PCR can be adopted to analyze transcripts of pri-amiRNA, miRNA target genes and other related genes with an efficiency similar to that of standard RT-PCR, and therefore, the same cDNA sample can be used for analyzing  amiRNA related transcripts<sup>12</sup>. Ths feature is espically useful for evaluating amiRNA-mediated gene knock-down in plant species where target transcripts are designed to be degraded followed by cleavage at amiRNA binding site. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Experiment design:**\r\n\n\n**RNA sample materials.** Although total RNAs can be extracted from plant or animal tissue using a wide range of reagents or kits, most column based RNA purification kits are not efficient in recovering both large RNAs and small RNAs spontaneously. We prefer precipation based method, such as using TRizol or Plant RNA reagent \\(invitrogen) or equivalent kit. Protocols of small scale RNA extraction from 50-100 mg of fresh tissue should provide enough RNA for RT-PCR analysis<sup>12</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Poly\\(A) tailing and reverse transcription.** The major limitation of the amiRNA for RT-PCR analysis is the small size of the amiRNA. Therefore, amiRNA sequences should be extended in RT-PCR analysis. AmiRNAs extended by poly\\(A) tailing can be reverse transcribed into cDNA along with mRNAs in a reverse transcription reaction primed by a standard poly\\(T) anchor adaptor \\(  \"Table 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2059/original/Table_1.txt?1328118394 ), and therefore, providing cDNA for followed PCR analysis \\( \"Fig. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2061/original/Figure-1_Chiang_s.jpg?132811087 ). The RNA poly\\(A) tailing and reverse transcription reaction can be done in the same tube and reacts as \u201cspontaneously\u201d. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Primer design.** The primers designed for amplification of the poly\\(A) tailed amiRNA are similar to those for miRNA<sup>11</sup>. The reverse primer is a universal primer that anneals to the adapter sequence, and the forward primer is an amiRNA specific primer \\( \"Fig. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2061/original/Figure-1_Chiang_s.jpg?132811087 ).  The amiRNA specific forward primer is designed to contain 15 to 18 nt from the 5\u2019 end of the amiRNA, because obtaining the partial 3\u2019 sequence of tested amiRNA for sequence verification is one of the goals of this protocol \\(  \"Table 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2059/original/Table_1.txt?1328118394, \"Fig. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2061/original/Figure-1_Chiang_s.jpg?132811087 ). The remaining 3 to 6 nt of the 3\u2019 unpaired sequence is detected by cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR product.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor determination of pri-amiRNA transcript level, the primer set includes an amiRNA specific forward primer and a reverse primer specific to the amiRNA primary transcript. All primers designed for amiRNA target genes, reference genes, such as actin and other protein coding genes are gene specific primers that follow the general primer design guidelines for conventional real time RT-PCR \\(  \"Table 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2059/original/Table_1.txt?1328118394, \"Fig. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2061/original/Figure-1_Chiang_s.jpg?132811087 )\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Validating expression of amiRNA.** There are three ways to validate the expression of an amiRNA. The signal of real time RT-PCR products of amiRNA can be detected during the amplification process. SYBR green can emit a fluorescence signal after binding to double strand DNAs. The more abundant amiRNA templates, the fewer PCR cycles are needed to reach a specific amount of PCR product, which can be evaluated by the fluorescence emitted from the SYBR green band to PCR products. Once the amplification signal reaches a threshold level, the cycle number \\(CT) can estimate the abundance of tested amiRNA. Dissociation curve analysis of PCR products can also confirm the expression of tested amiRNA. Successful amplification of tested amiRNA should show a unique peak in dissociation curve analysis. The melting temperature \\(Tm) of the peak should be around 70 \u00baC. At last, the amiRNA can be validated by sequence of the cloned PCR products. If sequences of amiRNA PCR products were identical to the designed amiRNA, then the amiRNA has been correctly processed, at least at the 3\u2019 end.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Analysis of transcript abundance of target and related genes.** Target gene expression can be determined using the same cDNA prepared from poly\\(A)-tailed total RNA by real time PCR. The primer set design should follow guidelines for conventional real time PCR."

The amiRNA expression was validated by the dissociation curve analysis. Each showed a unique peak with a Tm value around 70 \u00baC \\( \"Fig. 2b\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2062/original/Figure-2_Chiang_s.jpg?1328110875 ). Further verification by sequencing of the cloned PCR products indicated that the 3\u2019 portion of these amiRNA RT-PCR products was the identical to designed sequence \\( \"Fig. 2c\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2062/original/Figure-2_Chiang_s.jpg?1328110875 ). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe also measured the expression of pri-amiRNAs using poly\\(A) tailing based RT-PCR<sup>11</sup> and found pri-amiRNA transcripts were usually less abundant than those of the amiRNA12\\( \"Fig. 2a\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2062/original/Figure-2_Chiang_s.jpg?1328110875 ). The poly\\(A) tailing based RT-PCR can also be applied to estimate transcript abundance of amiRNA targets and other genes. We compared the efficiency of this method with the standard RT-PCR using the protocols recomanded by manual of TaqMan\u00ae Reverse Transcription Reagents kit.  Poly\\(A) tailing based RT-PCR has similar efficiency to standard RT-PCR<sup>12</sup>. Therefore, both amiRNA and mRNA can be analyzed using the same cDNA from poly\\(A) tailed RNA<sup>12</sup>. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn experiments with amiRNA mediated gene knock-downs, we found amiRNA target gene transcript levels were significantly reduced. For example, amiRNA-palA target genes _PAL2, PAL4_ and _PAL5_ are all down-regulated in amiRNA-palA transgenic plants, and amiRNA-palB target genes _PAL1_ and _PAL3_ are also down-regulated in amiRNA-palB transgenic plants<sup>12</sup> \\( \"Fig. 3\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2063/original/Figure-3_Chiang_s.jpg?1328110879 ). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTo evaluate the specificity of amiRNA mediated gene knockdown, the transcript levels of the similar off-target genes that should be considered<sup>12</sup>. If the amiRNA mediated gene knock-down is specific, then the expression levels of similar nontarget genes should not be affected. For example, _PAL2, PAL4_ and _PAL5_, are not designed to be the targets of amiRNA-palB. The transcript levels of these three PALs were found to be affected at a much lesser extent than the targets _PAL1_ and _PAL3_ in amiRNA-palB transgenic trees. _PAL1_ and _PAL3_, which is untargeted by amiRNA-palA were found to be substantially up-regulated in transgenic trees<sup>12</sup> \\( \"Fig. 3\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2063/original/Figure-3_Chiang_s.jpg?1328110879 ). This phenomenon has also been found in Arabidopsis _PAL_ mutants.

Total RNAs, including amiRNA, are poly\\(A) tailed using E.coli. poly\\(A) polymerase. Poly\\(A) tailed amiRNA can be converted into cDNA along with mRNAs in a reverse transcription reaction primed by a standard poly\\(T) anchor adaptor. AmiRNA can then be amplified and quantitated by real-time PCR using an amiRNA specific forward primer and a universal adaptor primer. Because the amiRNA forward primer is designed without annealing to the 3\u2019 end of the amiRNA, the precise 3\u2019 end sequence of the amiRNA can be obtained by sequencing the PCR product and used as verification of the accuracy of expressed amiRNA.
