            "content": "On the 7<sup>th</sup> day of human embryo development, the free-floating blastocyst must implant into the uterus to allow the organisation of the embryonic \\(epiblast) and extra-embryonic \\(hypoblast and trophoblast) tissues, and the formation of the future body plan. Despite its basic and clinical importance, the morphogenesis of the human embryo at the time of implantation remains largely unknown, because _in vivo_ experiments are not feasible and a system to culture human embryos beyond day 7 _in vitro_<sup>1</sup> has not been developed.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStudies on the development of monkey embryos have provided some understanding of the major morphogenetic events that take place at the time of implantation<sup>2-4</sup>. However, whether similar events happen in human embryos remains an open question. Here, we have established a system that allows human embryos to develop _in vitro_ through implantation stages, using a method that we recently developed to culture mouse embryos through implantation<sup>5</sup> as a starting point. By comparing embryos developing _in vitro_ with the Carnegie series of human embryos developing _in vivo_<sup>6</sup>, we have uncovered the major morphogenetic events of human implantation morphogenesis, including: segregation of embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages, formation of the pro-amniotic and yolk sac cavities, and generation of a bi-laminar structure. Remarkably, all these events happen _in vitro_ in the absence of maternal tissues, indicating that human embryos have a previously underappreciated self-organizing potential.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis protocol describes in detail how human cleavage-stage or blastocyst-stage embryos are thawed and cultured through pre- to-post-implantation stages _in vitro_ and how they can be analysed by immunofluorescence. In addition, we also provide a detailed protocol on how to generate hPSC 3D cultures that recapitulate the process of cavitation of the pluripotent lineage. We anticipate that the methods presented here will be instrumental to understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape the future human body at implantation. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCAUTION: This protocol should be used only with strict adherence to the internationally recognised guidelines on human embryonic research \\(see ISSCR guidelines http://www.isscr.org/docs/default-source/hesc-guidelines/isscrhescguidelines2006.pdf), and following approval by the appropriate institutional and government bodies."

A day before thawing human embryos, supplement the human embryo culture medium with 10% \\(vol/vol) human embryo culture protein supplement and incubate in a 21% O\n2\n/ 5% CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C to equilibrate over night.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Human embryo thawing. Follow one of the options below based on the embryo stage and the freezing procedure.\r\n  \r\n\n\nA. Origio Embryo Thawing Pack\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3A. Pre-warm the vials with thawing solutions 1-4 for 2 hours at room temperature and pre-warm autoclaved water at 30\u00b0C. Prior to starting the thawing procedure, prepare a 4-well dish with thawing solutions 1, 2, 3, and 4 in separate wells, \\(400 \u03bcL per well).\r\n\n\n4A. Remove the straw containing a slow-frozen cleavage-stage embryo from the liquid nitrogen and keep the straw in air at room temperature for 30 seconds. Immerse the straw into the pre-warmed water at 30\u02daC for 1 min.\r\n\n\n5A. Open the straw according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, release contents on a dry dish and immediately locate the embryo under the dissecting microscope.\r\n\n\n6A. Transfer the embryo to the solution from Vial 1 and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\r\n\n\n7A. Transfer the embryo to the solution from Vial 2 and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\r\n\n\n8A. Transfer the embryo to the solution from Vial 3 and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\r\n\n\n9A. Transfer the embryo to the solution from Vial 4 for a quick wash. \r\n\n\n10A. Wash the embryo three times in drops of pre-equilibrated complete human embryo culture medium.\r\n\n\n11A. Culture the embryo in a drop of human embryo culture medium under mineral oil until blastocyst stage in a 21% O\n2\n/ 5% CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nB. Kitazato Thawing Media Kit\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3B. A day before starting the procedure, pre-warm 1 mL of TS solution in a 37\u02daC incubator.\r\n\n\n4B. Prior to starting the thawing procedure, prepare a 35 mm dish with pre-warmed TS solution and a 4-well dish with DS, WS1 and WS2 solutions in separate wells \\(400 \u03bcL per well).\r\n\n\n5B. Remove the straw containing a vitrified blastocyst-stage embryo from the liquid nitrogen and open the straw according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\r\n\n\n6B. Immediately immerse the straw in the pre-warmed TS solution for 1 min and locate the embryo under the dissection microscope.\r\n\n\n7B. Transfer the embryo to the DS solution and incubate at room temperature for 3 min.\r\n\n\n8B. Transfer the embryo to WS1 solution and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. \r\n\n\n9B. Transfer the embryo to WS2 solution and incubate at room temperature for 1 min.\r\n\n\n10B. Wash the embryo three times in drops of pre-equilibrated complete human embryo culture medium.\r\n\n\n11B. Culture the embryo in a drop of pre-equilibrated complete human embryo culture medium for a minimum of two hours before removing the _zona pellucida_. This allows the embryo to recover from the thawing procedure. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nC. Quinn\u2019s Advantage Thaw Kit\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3C. Prior to starting the thawing procedure, prepare two 35mm dishes with 3 mL of 0.5 M Sucrose Thawing Medium and 3mL of 0.2 M Sucrose Thawing Medium, and pre-warm at 37\u00b0C. Prepare a dish with 7 drops of 100\u03bcL Freeze/Thaw Diluent Solution under mineral oil.\r\n\n\n4C. Remove the straw containing a slow-frozen blastocyst-stage embryo from the liquid nitrogen and hold the straw in the air at room temperature for 30-40 seconds. \r\n\n\n5C. Immerse the straw for 1 minute in 30-35\u00b0C water.\r\n\n\n6C. Release the contents on a dry dish and immediately locate the embryo under a dissection microscope.\r\n\n\n7C. Transfer the embryo to pre-warmed 0.5 M Sucrose Thawing Medium at 37\u00b0C and incubate for 5 min. \r\n\n\n8C. Transfer the embryo to pre-warmed 0.2 M Sucrose Thawing Medium at 37\u00b0C and incubate for 10 min. \r\n\n\n9C. Wash the embryo carefully through 7 drops of pre-warmed Freeze/Thaw Diluent Solution at 37 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n10C. Transfer the embryo to a drop of pre-equilibrated complete human embryo culture medium under mineral oil. \r\n\n\n11C. Culture the embryo in a drop of pre-equilibrated complete human embryo culture medium for a minimum of two hours before removing the _zona pellucida_. This allows the embryo to recover from the thawing procedure. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Culture of human embryos through pre- to post-implantation _in vitro_**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNOTE: This protocol starts when the human embryos reach the blastocyst stage \\(day 6 of development).\r\n\n\n12. A day before plating human embryos for pre- to post-implantation culture, place complete human embryo culture medium in a 21% O\n2\n/ 5% CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C to equilibrate over night. \r\n  13. On the day of the experiment \\(_in vitro_ culture day 0), prepare IVC1 and equilibrate it in 21% O\n2\n/ 5% CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C for a minimum of 1 hr.\r\n  Then, pipette 300 \u03bcL of the pre-equilibrated IVC1 per well of an ibiTreat 8-well \u03bc-plate. Add 300 \u03bcL of sterile PBS in each well that will not be used for embryo culture. \r\n\n\n14. Place Acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution at 37\u00b0C for a minimum of 15 min. Next, prepare a dish with a few 40 \u03bcL drops of pre-warmed Acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution and a few 40 \u03bcL drops of pre-equilibrated complete human embryo culture medium \\(to wash out the Acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution after removal of _zona pellucida_). \r\n  15. Use an EZ Squeeze pipette to place an embryo in the first Acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution drop. To aid in the dissolution of the _zona pellucida_ move the embryo to the next drop of Acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution until the _zona pellucida_ has dissolved. Immediately after, transfer the embryo to the human embryo culture medium drop and wash off the Acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution by moving the embryo through a few culture medium drops. \r\n  CRITICAL STEP: Minimize the culture medium content while embryos are transferred into the Acidic Tyrode\u2019s drops, as the buffers present in the culture medium neutralize the Acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution. Observe the embryo under the dissection microscope at all times, to minimise the exposure time to Acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution. Keep the Acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution warm \\(ideally at 37\u00b0C), as the efficiency of this reagent decreases at lower temperatures. \r\n\n\n16. Transfer the _zona pellucida_-free embryo into a well of the ibiTreat 8-well \u03bc-plate containing the pre-equilibrated IVC1 and immediately place the slide in a 21% O\n2\n/ 5% CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C. \r\n  17. On the _in vitro_ culture day 2 \\(about 48h after plating), prepare IVC2 and place it in a 21% O\n2\n/ 5% CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C to equilibrate for a minimum of 1 hour.\r\n  18. Carefully remove 150 \u03bcL of medium from the well using a sterile pipette tip and add 200 \u03bcL of pre-equilibrated IVC2. Immediately place the slide in 21% O\n2\n/ 5% CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C.\r\n  CRITICAL STEP: Embryos typically adhere on ibiTreat 8-well \u03bc-plate during _in vitro_ culture day 2 or 3. Therefore, it is important to observe the embryo during the first medium change.\r\n\n\n19. From _in vitro_ culture day 3 until the culture is terminated, change medium every day by removing 150 \u03bcL and adding 200 \u03bcL of pre-equilibrated IVC2 medium.\r\n  CAUTION: Following internationally recognised guidelines, cultures must be stopped on day 14 of development or prior to any signs of primitive streak\n7\n. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Human embryo immunofluorescence**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n20. Wash the embryos once with PBS. \r\n  21. Fix the embryos by incubating them in fixative solution at room temperature for 20 min. \r\n  22. Wash the embryos three times with washing solution at room temperature for 10 min. \r\n  23. Permeabilise the embryos by incubating them in permeabilisation solution at room temperature for 20 min. \r\n  24. Wash the embryos three times in washing solution at room temperature, for 10 min each. \r\n  25. Incubate the embryos in blocking solution at room temperature for 4 to 6 hrs or at 4\u00b0C over night.\r\n  26. Incubate the embryos with primary antibodies diluted 1:200 in blocking solution at 4\u00b0C over night.\r\n  NOTE: Different antibodies may require alternative fixation method, dilutions and/or incubation times. \r\n\n\n27. Wash the embryos three times in washing solution at room temperature for 10 min. \r\n  28. Incubate the embryos with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI diluted 1:500 in blocking solution at room temperature for 2-4 hours or at 4\u00b0C over night. \r\n  29. Wash the embryos two times in washing solution at room temperature for 10 min.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Part 2: hPSC 3D organoid culture**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNOTE: Culture hPSCs following standard conditions as previously described\n8,9\n. E8 or mTESR1 medium may be used to generate 3D hPSC cultures, as applicable. \r\n\n\n1. Prior to starting the experiment, place filter tips and ibiTreat 8-well \u03bc-plates in the refrigerator and thaw matrigel slowly on ice.\r\n  2. Detach hPSCs using StemPro Accutase by incubating at 37\u00b0C for 3 min.\r\n  3. Add E8 or mTESR1 and pipette the cell suspension in a 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge for 3 minutes at 1000 rpm.\r\n  4. Wash once with PBS and centrifuge the cell suspension for 3 minutes at 1000 rpm. Re-suspend the cells in either E8 or mTESR1.\r\n  NOTE: At this point, ROCK inhibitor may be added to prevent dissociation-induced cell death \\(optional).\r\n\n\n5. Count the cells using a hemacytometer. 2.5 \u00d710\n4\ncells are needed per well. \r\n  6. Coat the entire surface of the pre-chilled ibiTreat 8-well \u03bc-plate with 40 \u03bcL of ice-cold matrigel. \r\n  CRITICAL STEP: Use pre-chilled tips and keep the matrigel on ice at all times. Increasing temperatures lead to premature polymerisation. Make sure the matrigel covers the entire surface of the well. \r\n\n\n7. Place on a 37 \u00b0C incubator for 2 minutes or until the matrigel has solidified. Immediately after, add 2.5 \u00d710\n4\ncells in a final volume of 250 \u03bcL per well \\(cell suspension prepared in 5). \r\n  8. Incubate the cell suspension for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C or until most of the cells have attached to the matrigel. \r\n  9. Gently remove the supernatant and add fresh E8 or mTESR1 medium, supplemented with 5% matrigel. \r\n  NOTE: At this point, ROCK inhibitor may be added to prevent dissociation-induced cell death \\(optional) for 24 hours. \r\n\n\n10. Analyse lumen formation 24 or 48 hours after plating."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "The development of the human embryo beyond implantation has been poorly characterised, because _in vivo_ experiments are unfeasible and there is no appropriate _in vitro_ culture system. Here, we describe a protocol to culture human embryos from pre- to post-implantation stages _in vitro_, in the absence of maternal tissues. This protocol represents a unique opportunity to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of human embryo development beyond implantation. In addition, we report a protocol to recapitulate polarisation and lumenogenesis of the embryonic lineage using human pluripotent stem cell lines \\(hPSCs). We anticipate that future studies using these two _in vitro_ culture systems will help us understand how embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues cooperate to generate the basic human body plan.",
