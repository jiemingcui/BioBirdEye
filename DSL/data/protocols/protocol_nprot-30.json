            "content": "The Holliday junction is a key intermediate in various genetic processes including homologous and site-specific recombination and DNA replication<sup>1-3</sup>. Holliday junction is able to branch migrate along DNA allowing the exchange between homologous DNA regions. In bacteria, there are enzymes that promote DNA branch migration \\(BM)<sup>3</sup>. In eukaryotes, we recently showed that Rad54 protein catalyses BM of Holliday junctions<sup>4</sup>. Previously, &#x201C;non-movable&#x201D; X-junctions, consisting of a central homologous &#x201C;movable&#x201D; core flanked by the mutually heterologous terminal DNA branches<sup>5</sup> \\(Fig. 1a), were successfully used for detection of the BM activities of prokaryotic enzymes \\(ruvAB, RecG) that have both BM and helicase activities<sup>3</sup>. However they became unsuitable for detection of BM activity of Rad54 that do not have helicase activity<sup>4</sup>. We therefore constructed a &#x201C;movable&#x201D; X-junction in which three of the four terminal DNA branches were mutually homologous, allowing the crossover point to move freely by BM up to complete separation of two DNA duplexes, without any need for a helicase activity \\(Fig. 1b). Here we describe the protocols for construction of branched DNA substrates including the X-junctions \\(Holliday junctions), PX-junctions \\(partial junctions), movable replication forks and for usage of these substrates for detection of both 4-stranded and 3-standed BM activities of proteins."

            "content": "**Choosing a strategy for designing of branched DNA substrates for BM**\r\n\n\n1| The substrates for BM can be prepared by mixing and annealing of two simple DNA intermediates \\(forked, tailed and ssDNAs) \\(Fig. 2).\r\n\n\n2| When constructing the substrates with four arms \\(X-junctions, PX-junctions), it is important that one of the arms is non-homologous relative to three others \\(Fig. 2a, b shaded), otherwise it would be impossible to prepare forked DNA intermediates.\r\n\n\n3| To block spontaneous BM\n6, 7\nat least a single base pair heterology has to be introduced into duplexes involved in BM \\(Fig. 1b). The substrates for 3-stranded BM reaction should have at least four bases of heterology, because shorter regions of heterology are not sufficient to block spontaneous 3-stranded BM, which proceeds more efficiently than spontaneous BM on 4-stranded DNA substrates\n6, 7\n. When constructing PX-junctions or replication forks a heterologous base should be placed at least several bases away from the junction.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Preparation of substrates for BM**\r\n\n\n1| Purify the individual oligonucleotides by electrophoresis in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Label one of the oligonucleotides using \\[\u03b3-\n32\nP]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, followed by DNA purification through the Micro-BioSpin 6 column \\(Bio-Rad). Determine concentrations of all oligonucleotides spectrophotometrically using known molar extinction coefficients \\(can be obtained from the IDT website www.idtdna.com).\r\n\n\n2| To prepare tailed or forked DNA intermediates \\(Fig. 2), mix equal amounts of each of the complementary ssDNA strands \\(usually 1 \u00b5M of molecules) in 1 x SSC buffer, heat for 3 min at 95\u00b0C, and allow annealing to proceed for 1 hour at optimal hybridization temperature \\(T\nh\n). Calculate Th using the formula: T\nh\n=1.24 x T\nm\n-43.8; where T\nm\nis a melting temperature of the double-stranded part of the resulting structure. Calculate the T\nm\nusing a tool from the Promega website \\(www.promega.com/biomath/calc11.htm).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Testing of BM activity of proteins**\r\n\n\n1| Test BM activity in a range of protein concentrations by adding increasing amounts of your protein to the annealed BM structure \\(e.g. BM activity of Rad54 protein can be detected in 5-1000 nM range) and incubating the mixture for the desirable time at the reaction temperature.\r\n\n\n2| Measure the time course of the BM reaction at the appropriate protein concentrations.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Separation of BM products in polyacrylamide gel**\r\n\n\n1| Stop the reaction by addition of SDS \\(to 1.5%), place on ice, mix with a 1/10 volume of loading buffer \\(70% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and analyze by electrophoresis in native 5-10% polyacrylamide gels in 1 x TBE. Run the gel at 11 V/cm for 1.5-2 hours. Some proteins form very stable complexes with DNA whose disruption requires treatment with SDS \\(1.5%) and proteinase K \\(800 \u00b5g/ml) for 1-15 min at room temperature before electrophoresis. Alternatively stop the reaction by addition of 1/10 of the reaction volume of polydT \\(1 mg/ml, GE Healthcare) followed by 1 min incubation at 23\u00b0C and by deproteinization with SDS and proteinase K, as described above. Concentration and acrylamide/bis-acrylamide ratio of polyacrylamide gels may vary depending on the size and structure of BM substrates. Some structures \\(e.g. X-junctions) become unstable during electrophoresis at room temperature and should be resolved at 4\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n2| Dry the gel on DE81 chromatography paper, visualize and quantify the products of BM using a PhosphorImager system \\(GE Healthcare), or any other appropriate device."

It is also important to distinguish BM from the helicase activity of the proteins, because both these activities can cause formation of identical DNA products \\(Fig. 3). For this purpose, one needs to use the substrates that preclude formation of branched DNA junctions by incorporating of a heterologous sequence in one of the annealing DNA intermediates \\(Fig. 3b). Such substrates cannot be utilized by BM proteins and can serve as a control against helicase activities."
