            "content": "<p>Despite advances in treatment, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide<sup>1</sup>. Globally, about 12% of adults are diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and over 30% of all deaths are caused by cardiovascular disease<sup>1</sup>. The excessive demand of heart transplantation has outpaced the limited number of healthy and functional heart donors<sup>2</sup>. Cell-based regenerative therapy provides a promising treatment for patients suffering from cardiac tissue injury<sup>3, 4</sup>. However, cardiomyocytes (CMs) are terminally differentiated cells with no regenerative capacity<sup>5</sup>. Hence, cost-effective and time-efficient platforms to generate functional CMs with high quality has emerged as an urgent need for cardiac medicine in drug screening, toxicity testing, disease modeling, and regenerative cell therapy. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can differentiate into cells from all three germ layers<sup>6-8</sup>.&nbsp;A variety of methods have been established to generate CMs from hPSCs<sup>9-11</sup>. These hPSC-derived CMs exhibit similar functional phenotypes to their <em>in vivo</em> counterparts<sup>11</sup>, including self-contractility and action potentials. hPSC-derived CMs have been used in disease modeling<sup>12, 13</sup> and drug screening<sup>14</sup>, and hold great potential for regenerative medicine<sup>15, 16</sup>. However, batch-to-batch and line-to-line variability in the differentiation process of hPSCs into CMs has impeded the scale-up of CM manufacturing<sup>17</sup>. For safety, the quality of clinical-graded hPSC-derived CMs must be rigorously evaluated before they can be used for regenerative cell therapy in patients<sup>18</sup>. Current approaches to quantify CM differentiation rely on low-throughput, labor-intensive, and destructive immunofluorescence labelling and electrophysiological measurements<sup>11</sup>. New technologies that can non-invasively monitor CM differentiation in real time and evaluate the differentiation outcome at early stages are needed to effectively optimize biomanufacturing of CMs from stem cells. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Previous studies indicate that hPSC-derived CMs undergo dramatic metabolic changes throughout differentiation<sup>19</sup>. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) and oxidized flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are autofluorescent cellular metabolic co-enzymes that can be imaged to collect metabolic information at a single-cell level<sup>20</sup>. The ratio of NAD(P)H to FAD intensity is the \u201coptical redox ratio\u201d, which reflects the relative oxidation-reduction state of the cell. The fluorescence lifetimes of NAD(P)H and FAD are distinct in the free and protein-bound conformations, so changes in these fluorescence lifetimes reflect changes in protein-binding activity<sup>21, 22</sup>. Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) quantifies both NAD(P)H and FAD intensity and lifetime variables. Several groups have demonstrated that autofluorescence imaging can non-invasively track stem cell metabolic activities in real time, including monitoring mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into adipocytes<sup>23, 24</sup>, osteocytes<sup>24, 25</sup>, and chondrocytes<sup>25</sup>, distinguishing differentiation of hPSCs into dermal and epidermal lineages<sup>26</sup>,&nbsp;metabolic difference between hPSCs and feeder cells<sup>27</sup>, and hematopoietic stem cells at different stages<sup>28</sup>. These prior studies indicate that OMI is suitable to detect the metabolic changes that occur during CM differentiation. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of this study is to build a predictive model based on OMI to determine whether OMI can monitor CM differentiation process. We demonstrate a facile method to non-invasively monitor metabolic changes during hPSC differentiation into CMs by combining OMI with quantitative image analysis. OMI is performed at multiple time points during a 12-day differentiation process under varying conditions (cell density, concentration of Wnt signaling activator) and different hPSC lines (human embryonic pluripotent stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells). Differentiation efficiency is quantified by flow cytometry with cTnT labelling on day 12. During the differentiation process all 13 OMI variables, including both NAD(P)H and FAD intensity and lifetime variables are collected. This label-free and non-destructive method could be used for quality control for CM manufacturing from hPSCs.&nbsp;</p>"

Repeat this process every other day until differentiation day 12.\n10.\u00a0Autofluorescence dynamics of NAD(P)H and FAD by OMI during the process of hPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes are recorded by an Ultima two-photon imaging system (Bruker). Cells are imaged on differentiation day 0 (immediately pre-treatment with CHIR99021, a Wnt signaling activator), day 1 (24 hours post-treatment with CHIR99021), day 3 (immediately pre-treatment with IWP2, a Wnt signaling inhibitor), and day 5 (48 hours post-treatment with IWP2). OMI is performed at these time points based on the biphasic role of Wnt signaling activation and inhibition in the cardiomyocyte differentiation protocol. The ultrafast tunable laser source enables sequential excitation of NAD(P)H at 750 nm and FAD at 890 nm. NAD(P)H and FAD emission is isolated using 440/80 nm and 550/100 nm bandpass filters (Chroma), respectively. The laser power at the sample for NAD(P)H and FAD excitation was approximately 2.3 mW and 7.9 mW, respectively. Fluorescence lifetime decays with 256 time bins were acquired across 256 \u00d7 256 pixel images with a pixel dwell time of 4.8 \u00b5s and an integration period of 60 seconds. All samples are illuminated through a 40\u00d7/1.15 NA objective (Nikon). The instrument response function was acquired from the second harmonic generated signal of urea crystals at 890 nm and was measured for each imaging session. (Figure 1).

However, cost-effective and time-efficient platforms must be developed to evaluate the quality of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes during biomanufacturing. Here, we develop a non-invasive label-free live cell imaging platform to monitor hPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Autofluorescence imaging of metabolic co-enzymes is performed under varying differentiation conditions (cell density, concentration of Wnt signaling activator) across five hPSC lines.</p>",
