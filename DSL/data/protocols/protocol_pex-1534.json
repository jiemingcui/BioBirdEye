            "content": "<p>Since 2020 January world has been gripped by the corona virus disease 2019 (covid-19), which in no time developed into a pandemic infecting millions of people worldwide. To tackle the spread of virus many countries have closed non essential business and implemented stay at home orders, halting many developmental programs leading to job insecurity and unemployment. Many employed were removed from their jobs and few others retained their jobs to return, in a view that economic activities would resume once lockdown was eased during which they were neither worked nor received payment. Buheji et al analyzed the effect of pandemic on poor communities across four continents and estimated that nearly 49 million individuals will be driven into extreme poverty in 2020(1). In a study by John Euart et al almost 50% of the surveyed Indians expressed their concern over job security (2).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to shut down of the factories and work places there was a profound negative impact on daily wage workers and farmers pushing them into famine and starvation. Because of loss of income and resulting economic crisis many migrant workers began to walk back to their native places. Even there are no market places to sell the crops for farmers. All these led to decrease in socioeconomic status of many middle- and lower-income group. Few managed to meet their livelihood by using their savings and by reducing the cost of livelihood. According to the report from statista, on impact of lockdown on unemployment rate in India from January 2020 to January 2021, which reported nearly 6 percent unemployment in January 2021, it also said that unemployment was nearly 24% in April 2020. This was possibly a result of decrease in demand as well as disruption of workforce faced by companies (3). This had most devastating impact on economic backward classes. This made the government to launch various programs and campaigns to help poor. One of such kind is pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojana, under this nearly 1.70 lakh crores of Indian rupees was announced as relief package for poor to help them fight the battle against coronavirus. Through this nearly 50 lakh health care workers were provided with insurance, distributed wheat, rice and pulses at free of cost to nearly 80 crore people, it also aimed at helping farmers and household women financially (4). Many state governments have also started their own programs to help economically backward classes, in spite of all these efforts, most communities were unaware of such programs and many migrant workers have no access to such welfare schemes and were away from such benefits. Main drawback in such welfare programs is that they were carried out for short duration like 3-4 months but as we all know that pandemic is still on its wave and even unemployment so there is need for continuing such programs and government and NGOs should ensure that all the welfare schemes reach every deserving person. </p><p>This economic crisis will have a far-reaching effect on mental health and well being of the people (10, 11). The magnitude of these effects will depend on the course of pandemic and no predictions can be made at this point. They suffered from depression, panic, fear anxiety and stress. According to the national income dynamics-corona virus rapid mobile survey conducted during may to august 2020 among 7000 African individuals, adults who retained employment during the covid-19 lockdown reported significantly lower depression scores than adults who lost their employment (5). This mental suffering also resulted in suicides in few cases. Besides other lockdown stressors ach as economic crises and recession, unemployment and poverty may be highly associated with psychological distress and suicidal behavior (7). Analysis of the 69 Indian suicides cases by Deena et al showed that nearly 23 people have committed suicide because of financial crisis after Covid infection (6). To fight the unemployment and to boost fresh hiring in the country government has launched Atma Nirbhar Bharat Rozgar yojana which was launched in October. It mainly aimed at creating new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during pandemic. This led to decrease in unemployment rate thereafter but repeated interventions, monitoring of schemes and initiatives at the ground level are required to achieve better benefits and it also help in benefiting maximum population (8, 9). Widespread nature of covid-19 pandemic requires the enforcement of durable and long-lasting measures ensuring public health and income (11).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this research we want to assess the socio-economic status of general public and their financial stability or loss incurred with pandemic. We even want to estimate time that might be required to recover the loss. We also want to investigate the percent of general public benefited from government welfare schemes.</p><p><br></p>"
