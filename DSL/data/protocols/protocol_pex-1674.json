This aids mixing of the trypsin and SBTI, and helps remove remaining adherent cells.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer the cells to a sterile centrifuge tube.\nNOTE:\nCells from the same donor source plated over individual wells or flasks can be combined.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pellet cells at 200-600 x\ng\nfor 5 minutes at room temperature in a centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the supernatant.\u00a0Note the size of the cell pellet before tapping the tube to break up the pellet.\u00a0Ideally, the pellet should be resuspended in a volume of medium that will yield a cell density of 1.0x10\n6\ncells/mL. Triturate the cells with a serological pipet to create a homogeneous suspension.\nNOTE:\nWith experience, you will be able to judge this volume based on the pellet size.\u00a0For a barely visible pellet, start with 1 mL medium; for a pellet of 1 cm, start with 10ml medium (generally, resuspension volumes will range from 5-10 mL).\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer a 10 mL aliquot of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count the cells.\u00a0Viability can be determined, if desired, by diluting a sample of the cells with an equal volume of trypan blue.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adjust the number of cells to approximately 1.0x10\n6\n/mL.\u00a0If the cell density is less than 1.0x10\n6\n/mL, re-pellet the cells and suspend in the appropriate volume.\u00a0If the cells density is greater than 1.0x10\n6\n/mL, dilute the cell suspension with the appropriate volume of medium.\n10. Plating density will be based on how quickly you want the cells to be ready for subsequent passage/plating.\u00a0Cells are typically seeded at 0.5 x 10\n4\ncells/cm\n2\nbut can be seeded more heavily if desired.\n11. Change the medium every other day until cells reach approximately 70% confluence.\u00a0Denser cultures may require more frequent medium replacement.\n12. Upon approaching confluence cells can be:\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passaged further for culture (seeding densities and volumes in table below)\nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plated on Transwell inserts for ALI differentiation (seeding densities and volumes in table below)\nc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cryopreserved (procedure described below\nRefer to Tables 1A and B for Suggested Cell Seeding Densities/Volumes in Flasks and Multi-Well Plates.\nCells should be used at 90-100% confluence for experiments.\nDifferentiation of pHBEC Cultures at ALI\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trypsinize and collect cells from expansion flasks as described in steps #1-9 of the \u201cPassaging and Expansion of pHBEC\u201d section above.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Starting with a cell density of 1.0x10\n6\ncells/mL, prepare a volume and dilution of cell suspension according to the size and number of Transwell inserts needed based on the seeding density and volume table below.\nNOTE:\nPrepare a volume of diluted cell suspension that is greater than the exact amount needed for the desired plating to account for volume loss and/or slight variations in pipetting.\nExample:\nIf seeding 12 24mm inserts at 3.0x10\n5\ncells per insert then prepare sufficient cell suspension for seeding 14 inserts to allow for volume lost during handling.\n14 x 0.75 ml = 10.5 mL final volume.\n14 inserts x 3.0x10\n5\ncells/insert = 4.2x10\n6\ncells needed\nIf your cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1.0x10\n6\n/mL, then you would add 4.2 mL of the cell suspension to 6.3 mL of additional medium to get the desired plating density (3.0x10\n5\n/0.75 mL added to each insert).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Allow cells to adhere to Transwell inserts for 16-24 hours. After the adhesion period, aspirate medium to remove nonadherent cells and add fresh Pneumacult Ex-Plus growth medium in the apical compartment.\u00a0Continue to grow in Pneumacult Ex-Plus growth medium until the cells are confluent.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once cells are confluent, withdraw the apical medium and replace the basolateral medium with Pneumacult ALI differentiation medium.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Replace the Pneumacult ALI differentiation medium in the basolateral compartment every 48 hours.\nNOTE:\nCilia will become visible in as little as 7 days. \u00a0Cells will continue to differentiate and the majority of culture surface will become ciliated.\u00a0Washing the apical surface with DPBS at least once per week is recommended.\nDetermine the number of inserts to be seeded and adjust cell density and volume as outlined in the table below. STEMCELL recommends 0.5 x 10\n5\ncells/cm\n2\n.\u00a0We have seen the best results with cells seeded on the membranes at passage 2 and 3, but we have obtained highly ciliated cultures from differention of passage 5 cells.\nRefer to Table 2 for Suggested Cell Seeding Densities/Volumes for Corning Transwell Inserts.\nCryopreservation of pHBEC\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trypsinize and collect cells from expansion flasks as described in steps #1-8 of the \u201cPassaging and Expansion of pHBEC\u201d section above.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pellet cells again at 200-600 x\ng\nfor 4 minutes at room temperature in centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend the pellet in CryStor10 Freezing Medium at a minimum of 1.0x10\n6\ncells/mL.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gently mix by pipetting.\u00a0Transfer 1.0 mL of the cell suspension to each cryovial.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place cryovials in a Mr. Frosty freezing container (filled to indicated line with isopropyl alcohol) and place in a -80 \u00b0C freezer overnight.\na.\nNOTE:\nIsopropanol should be changed after every three freezing cycles.\nb.\nNOTE:\nDo not leave vials at -80 \u00b0C longer than overnight as it will impact viability after thawing.\nTransfer the frozen vials in liquid nitrogen storage."
