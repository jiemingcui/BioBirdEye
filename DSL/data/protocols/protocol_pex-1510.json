            "content": "<p>\tEpithelial organs consist of multiple types of epithelial tissue, such as alveoli and trachea in the lung, urinary tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney, acini and pancreatic ducts in the pancreas, and bile canaliculi (BC) and bile ducts (BDs) in the liver. The structures connecting two types of tissues are unique to each organ. Various substances, including air, urine, digestive enzymes, and bile are altered in composition as they flow through the connecting structures It is therefore crucial to accurately connect tissue structures composed of different types of epithelial cells, in order to reproduce the function of each organ<em> ex vivo</em>.</p><p>\tTo generate organoids, or mini-organs, tissue stem cells are cultured in three dimensions (3D), to enable the cells to grow, divide, and self-organize into tissue structures similar to those found <em>in vivo</em>. This approach has been used to generate functional components of the gastrointestinal tract, including intestinal (<em>1</em>), gastric (<em>2</em>), colonic (<em>3</em>), and hepatic tissues (<em>4, 5</em>). The organoids are likely to contain niches for maintaining tissue stem/progenitor cells, given that these organoids can expand in size. However, each organoid consists of a single type of tissue, and they do not contain structures connecting different types of epithelial cells.</p><p>\tIn this study, we present a mouse hepatobiliary tubular organoid (HBTO) with hepatocyte clusters derived from small hepatocytes (SHs), and a biliary network derived from epithelial cell adhesion molecule positive (EpCAM<sup>+</sup>) cholangiocytes. In HBTO, bilirubin and fluorescein-labeled bile acid were absorbed by the hepatocytes, excreted into BCs, and then accumulated in the biliary system, indicating that a connection between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes had been established. The development of HBTOs enabled us to investigate the transport of hepatocyte metabolites within the liver tissue, and to monitor the metabolism of the hepatocytes in the long-term <em>ex vivo</em>.</p>"

Here, we report generation of a hepatobiliary tubular organoid (HBTO) using mouse hepatocyte progenitors called small hepatocytes (SHs) and cholangiocytes. SHs differentiate and form the bile canalicular network in HBTOs and secret metabolites into the canaliculi, which are then transported into the biliary structure. Hepatocytes in the organoid acquire and maintain metabolic functions including albumin secretion and cytochrome P450 activities, over the long term. We provide the step-by-step protocol for induction of HBTO including isolation of cholangiocytes and SHs and co-culture of these two types of cell to generate functional connections between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.</p>",
