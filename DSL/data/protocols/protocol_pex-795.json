Insert the RJ plug at the end of the flexible electrode cable into the Input port on the meter.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Set the Function switch to Ohms. Disconnect the EVOM2 from the charger and turn the Power on (I).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To measure the blank resistance, place the electrode in a blank insert with cell media in the basal compartment and PBS in the apical compartment.\n*When making measurements, the longer prong goes outside the insert in the media.\u00a0The shorter prong goes over the Transwell\n\u00d2\n.\u00a0The probe should not be angled and should be slightly touching the bottom of the dish.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insert the electrode into the blank cup. A steady reading of the solution resistance should result. The value of the blank always adds to the total resistance measured across a tissue culture membrane. \u00a0NOTE: The blank resistance must be measured and then subtracted from the resistance reading across tissue in order to obtain the true tissue resistance.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take three resistance readings per insert.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make experimental resistance measurements. Subtract the blank resistance to obtain the resistance value of cultured cell monolayers.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When finished, clean and store the electrode dry.\nElectrode Cleaning\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rinse with the electrode with distilled water and dry it.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make a 1% solution of Tergazyme according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suspend the tips of the electrodes in the Tergazyme solution, with the exposed electrode surfaces fully immersed. During soaking, the surfaces of the electrodes may be brushed with a soft brush (like a tooth brush), if desired.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soak overnight if the electrodes have not been cleaned on a regular maintenance schedule.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soak 30\u201360 minutes if on a weekly cleaning schedule or 5 minutes if on a daily schedule.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rinse well with distilled or de-ionized water. Allow electrode to air dry and store dry away from exposure to sunlight.\nProbe Maintenance\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The probe may be occasionally resurfaced by lightly sanding with 600-grit ultra-fine sandpaper."
