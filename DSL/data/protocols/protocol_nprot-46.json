The MethyLight-based data is presented as a percentage relative to an M.SssI-treated methylated DNA reference sample \\(PMR). We have extended the applicability of MethyLight technology to assay for the presence of the CpG island methylator phenotype \\(CIMP) in human colorectal cancer. We provide here a detailed, step-by-step protocol of the MethyLight assay for detection of CIMP with high sensitivity and specificity in colorectal cancer using a five marker panel composed of CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1. Our criteria state that a sample with &#x2265;3 of five markers posititve for methylation \\(PMR&gt;10) is CIMP positive \\(CIMP+), while a sample with &#x2264;2 of the five markers positive for methylation is considered CIMP negative \\(CIMP-)."

            "content": "1. M.SssI MODIFICATION\r\n  \r\n\n\nM.SssI is a CpG methylase that methylates cytosines in the context of the CpG dinucelotide using S-adenosyl methionine \\(SAM) as a methyl donor. M.SssI-treated DNA is used as a universally methylated reference sample in all MethyLight reactions. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDNA Sample:\r\n\n\n\u2022 Male peripheral blood leukocyte DNA \\(75 \u00b5g; PBL-DNA) is commonly used as a substrate, however, any genomic DNA sample may be appropriate. PBL-DNA is obtained from Promega \\(cat# G147A). The PBL-DNA concentration varies depending on batch, so the volume of PBL-DNA used in the M.SssI reaction should be determined empirically. \r\n\n\n\u2022 M.SssI enzyme is obtained from New England Biolabs \\(cat# M0226S). Use 1 unit M.SssI /\u00b5g DNA. S-adenosyl methionine \\(SAM) is provided with the enzyme by the manufacturer.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nReaction set-up:\r\n\n\nComponent \r\n\n\nDNA \\(0.05 \u00b5g/\u00b5l final conc.)\r\n\n\n32mM SAM: use 7.5 \u00b5l \\(0.16 mM final conc.)\r\n\n\n10X NEB2 Buffer: use 150 \u00b5l \\(1X final conc.)\r\n\n\nM.SssI Enzyme \\(4 u/\u00b5l): use 19 \u00b5l \\(0.05 units/\u00b5l final conc.)\r\n\n\nwater: to 1500 \u00b5l\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nM.SssI Reaction:\r\n\n\n1. Combine reaction components and incubate at 37\u00b0C overnight.\r\n  2. The next day, add the following components as a boost:\r\n  SAM \\(32mM): add 2.5\u00b5l\r\n\n\nM.SssI enzyme \\(4 units/\u00b5l): add 6.0\u00b5l\r\n\n\nWater: add 22.5\u00b5l\r\n\n\nIncubate at 37\u00b0C overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRepeated rounds of M.SssI treatment are beneficial for methylating the genomic DNA sample. After each round of M.SssI treatment, the purified DNA sample should be bisulfite-converted and tested with a methylation-specific MethyLight reaction to determine if the methylation reaches a plateau before proceeding with the CIMP-MethyLight analyses.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAfter bisulfite conversion, dilute the M.SssI-DNA \\(1:10) and use 10 \u00b5l of this sample for each PCR reaction. This should be used in duplicate for each MethyLight reaction as well as for the ALU control reaction. This M.SssI-DNA sample is also used as a template for the standard curve samples.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Bisulfite Conversion & DNA Recovery: \r\n  \r\n\n\nThe bisulfite conversion and recovery of bisulfite-converted DNA steps are performed using the Zymo EZ DNA methylation kit \\(Zymo Research, Orange, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. M.SssI-modified DNA is also treated with bisulfite for use as a methylated reference in MethyLight assays. There should be a sufficient amount of sample DNA \\(usually >100 ng of genomic DNA) to properly analyze the presence of CIMP, since lower amounts of bisulfite-converted DNA typically give less reliable methylation information. Samples with low DNA amounts \\(and corresponding higher C\\(t) values during MethyLight real-time TaqMan PCR assays) may show zero methylation, however, this may simply be the result of an insufficient amount of DNA that is undetectable by the specific MethyLight assay.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 We typically perform a preliminary MethyLight control PCR reaction with a small amount of undiluted, bisulfite-converted sample \\(2\u00b5l added plus 8 \u00b5l water) using the ALU-C4 \\(Alu repeats) bisulfite control reaction. The C\\(t) value generated from this 1:5 dilution will give an indication of the approximate bisulfite-converted DNA sample amounts, and the degree to which the bisulfite-DNA sample can be diluted. Since the ALU-C4 reaction is highly sensitive and will generate low C\\(t) values, a sample that gives a C\\(t) = 22 is considered maximally diluted. However, it should be noted that lower C\\(t) values are always preferred to achieve the best possible data. An ALU-C4 C\\(t)<20 is usually desirable. For the CIMP study, we have selected five reactions. Therefore, bisulfite conversion of >100 ng DNA sample should be sufficient for the five MethyLight reactions and controls, if the C\\(t) values are appropriate \\(although more input DNA amounts will give improved C\\(t) values). A final volume of approximately 300 \u00b5l after dilution will allow all five CIMP and control reactions to be analyzed in duplicate and allows for pipetting or other errors. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. MethyLight Primer/Probe Preparation:\r\n  \u2022 The MethyLight assay utilizes the TaqMan PCR principle which requires forward and reverse primers as well as an oligomeric probe which emits fluorescence only after it is degraded by the 5\u2019-3\u2019 exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Each PCR reaction uses the same basic reaction set-up \u2013 the choice of primer/probe sets is the only variable in these reactions. All primer/probe sets used are diluted to the same stock concentrations to standardize the PCR reaction set-up as well as the running of the PCR program.\r\n\n\n1. The primers and probes, since they are lyophilized after synthesis, need to be dissolved in sterile water. Prepare the forward and reverse primers at a concentration of 300 \u00b5M and the probe at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. Make small aliquots of the primers at these concentrations to prevent repeated freeze/thaw events.\r\n  2. Dilute the primers/probe to a working stock of 6\u00b5M \\(primers) and 2\u00b5M \\(probe). This is achieved by combining the stock solutions of the forward primer, reverse primer and probe in one tube as an Oligo Mix: \\(4 \u00b5l of the 300 \u00b5M forward primer, 4 \u00b5l of the 300 \u00b5M reverse primer, and 4 \u00b5l of the 100 \u00b5M probe in a 600 \u00b5l total volume).\r\n  3. Use 4.5 \u00b5l of the Oligo Mix per 30 \u00b5L MethyLight reaction. This 4.5 \u00b5l volume represents the combined volumes from each of the two individual 6 \u00b5M primers and the 2 \u00b5M probe.\r\n  \u2022 It should be noted that the probe for each methylation reaction contains a black hole quencher \\(BHQ-1) at the 3\u2019 end and a 6FAM fluorophore at the 5\u2019 terminus; the probe for the ALU control reaction contains the same 6FAM fluorophore, but contains a Minor Groove Binder Non Fluorescent Quencher \\(MGBNFQ) at the 3\u2019 end of the probe.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. MethyLight Reaction set-up:\r\n  \u2022 The MethyLight reaction set-up is described in the accompanying protocol. In brief, two types of reactions will be used: 1) MethyLight reactions: use bisulfite converted DNA as a substrate. The forward/reverse primers and probe are specific for methylated DNA \\(CpG after bisulfite conversion) and are also specific for bisulfite converted DNA. 2) The bisulfite specific control reaction \\(ALU-C4): measures the loading of bisulfite converted DNA. These reactions are not methylation specific \\(no CpGs in the primer/probe sequences), but are specific for bisulfite converted DNA. \r\n\n\n\u2022 The MethyLight reactions for the CIMP study will be limited to determining the methylation of five CIMP-specific individual loci.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Each PCR reaction \\(methylation or control reaction) uses the same basic reaction set-up \u2013 the choice of primer/probe sets is the only variable in the MethyLight reactions. All primer/probe sets used are diluted to the same stock concentrations to standardize the PCR reaction set-up and the running of the PCR program.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMETHYLIGHT PCR REACTION SET-UP:\r\n\n\nRequired Kits:\r\n\n\nApplied Biosystems \\(ABI) TaqMan 1000 Reaction Gold With Buffer A Pack \\(Cat #4304441). Taq polymerase, 25mM MgCl2 and 10X Buffer are supplied with each kit.\r\n\n\n\u2022 It should be noted that Uracil DNA glycosylase \\(AMPerase) should NOT be included as a component in the PCR reactions. It is not included in the ABI TaqMan kit described above, but is common in other TaqMan kits from ABI and other commercial sources. AMPerase catalyzes the removal of uracil, and this is problematic since bisulfite converted DNA is used as a DNA template and will therefore contain uracil \\(from unmethylated cytosines). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRequired Reaction Components:\r\n\n\n\u2022 dNTPs were obtained from Amersham \\(cat # 27-2035-03). A 10mM dNTP stock was prepared and stored at \u201320 \u00b0C in 1.2 ml aliquots.\r\n\n\n\u2022 10X stabilizer was prepared as described below.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPCR Reaction Set-Up:\r\n\n\nPCR Component \\(Final Concentration)\r\n\n\n4.2 \u00b5l 25mM MgCl2 \\(3.5 mM)  \r\n\n\n3.0 \u00b5l 10X Buffer \\(1X)\r\n\n\n3.0 \u00b5l 10X stabilizer \\(1X) \r\n\n\n0.6 \u00b5l 10mM dNTPs \\(200 \u00b5M)\r\n\n\n4.6 \u00b5l water\r\n\n\n1.5 \u00b5l 6\u00b5M forward primer \\(0.3 \u00b5M)\r\n\n\n1.5 \u00b5l 6\u00b5M reverse primer \\(0.3 \u00b5M)\r\n\n\n1.5 \u00b5l 2\u00b5M probe \\(0.1 \u00b5M)\r\n\n\n0.1 \u00b5l Taq Gold Polymerase \r\n\n\n10.0 \u00b5l DNA sample\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Since the primers and probe are the only unique components to the PCR reactions, the PCR reaction mix can be divided into three parts: 1.) the OligoMix, which contains the forward and reverse primers as well as the probe in one tube; 2) the PreMix, which contains all the reaction components except for the DNA sample, Taq polymerase and primers/probe; 3) the MasterMix, which combines the OligoMix, PreMix and Taq polymerase. The MasterMix is added to the DNA sample.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. OligoMix Preparation:\r\n  \r\n\n\n\u2022 The primers and probes, since they are lyophilized after synthesis, need to be dissolved in sterile water. Prepare the forward and reverse primers at a concentration of 300 \u00b5M and the probe at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. Make small aliquots of the primers at these concentrations to prevent repeated freeze/thaw events.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Dilute the primers/probe to a working stock of 6\u00b5M \\(primers) and 2\u00b5M \\(probe). This is achieved by combining the stock solutions of the forward primer, reverse primer and probe in one tube \\(4 \u00b5l of the 300 \u00b5M forward primer, 4 \u00b5l of the 300 \u00b5M reverse primer and 4 \u00b5l of the 100 \u00b5M probe in 600 \u00b5l total volume):\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nForward primer: 300 \u00b5M stock; use 4\u00b5l; 6 \u00b5M final conc.\r\n\n\nReverse primer: 300 \u00b5M stock; use 4\u00b5l; 6 \u00b5M final conc.\r\n\n\nProbe: 100 \u00b5M stock; use 4\u00b5l; 2 \u00b5M final conc.\r\n\n\nWater: add 588 \u00b5l\r\n\n\nTOTAL VOLUME: 600 \u00b5l\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022Use 4.5 \u00b5l of this OligoMix per 30 \u00b5l MethyLight reaction. As shown in the PCR MasterMix Reaction Set-Up, this 4.5 \u00b5l volume represents the combined volumes from each of the two individual 6 \u00b5M primers and the 2 \u00b5M probe. After addition to the PCR reaction mixture, the forward/reverse primers are at a concentration of 0.3\u00b5M, and the probe at 0.1 \u00b5M.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. PreMix Preparation:\r\n  \u2022The PreMix contains all TaqMan reaction components except Taq polymerase and the primers/probe.\r\n\n\n\u2022Each TaqMan reaction kit is sufficient for 2000 MethyLight reactions:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFOR ONE REACTION:           \r\n\n\n25mM MgCl2: 4.2\u00b5l \r\n\n\n10X Buffer: 3.0\u00b5l  \r\n\n\n10X stabilizer: 3.0\u00b5l  \r\n\n\n10mM dNTPs: 0.6\u00b5l     \r\n\n\nWater: 4.6\u00b5l   \r\n\n\nTOTAL: 15.4\u00b5l\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFOR 2000 REACTIONS:\r\n\n\n25mM MgCl2: 8.4 ml\r\n\n\n10X Buffer: 6.0 ml\r\n\n\n10X Stabilizer: 6.0 ml\r\n\n\n10mM dNTPs: 1.2 ml\r\n\n\nwater: 9.2 ml\r\n\n\nTOTAL: 30.8 ml\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Store the PreMix as 1.925 ml aliquots at +4 \u00b0C. Taq polymerase \\(12.5 \u00b5l) can be added to the 1.925 ml PreMix sample. This would provide pre-mix for 125 PCR reactions, and is sufficient for all the MethyLight reactions on a 96-well plate \u2013 PreMixes and MasterMixes are always prepared to accommodate for more reactions than are needed.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. MasterMix Preparation:\r\n  \u2022 To prepare the MasterMix, simply combine the appropriate volumes of PreMix, OligoMix and Taq polymerase:\r\n\n\n     \r\n\n\nPreMix: 15.4 \u00b5l\r\n\n\nOligoMix: 4.5 \u00b5l \\(1.5 \u00b5l each)\r\n\n\nTaq Polymerase: 0.1 \u00b5l\r\n\n\nTOTAL: 20.0 \u00b5l     \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. PCR Reaction:\r\n  \u2022 Load 10 \u00b5l of DNA into the wells of a 96-well plate and then add 20\u00b5L of the MasterMix.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Seal caps on the plate, mix and centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 1 minute. Then place in real-time PCR instrument.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022PCR program: 95\u00b0C for 10 min\r\n\n\nThen 50 cycles of:\r\n\n\n95\u00b0C for 15 sec\r\n\n\n60\u00b0C for 1 min\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTAQMAN STABILIZER PREPARATION:\r\n\n\n10X stabilizer: \r\n\n\n0.1% Tween-20\r\n\n\n0.5% gelatin\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRequired Components:\r\n\n\nTween-20 \\(polyoxyethylenesorbitan Monolaurate): Fisher #BP-337-100\r\n\n\nGelatin: Sigma #G-9391\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n10X Stabilizer Preparation:\r\n\n\n20% Tween-20:\r\n\n\n2ml 100% Tween-20 \r\n\n\n8ml Nuclease free water\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMeasure 8ml of water in a 15ml sterile screw capped tube. Add 2ml of Tween-20 to the water and pipet the solution repeatedly until all the Tween is mixed with the water and to remove traces of Tween from the pipet. Store at +20 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n10X stabilizer:\r\n\n\n0.2g Gelatin\r\n\n\n0.2ml 20% Tween-20\r\n\n\nNuclease-free water to 40ml\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWeigh out 0.2g gelatin and add it to 50mL conical screw capped tube. Add 20ml of water. Heat to dissolve the gelatin and after it is all melted, add 0.2ml of 20% Tween-20 and bring the final volume to 40ml with nuclease free water. Store at +20 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5. MethyLight Plate Set-up:\r\n  \u2022 To analyze the methylation of the five CIMP-specific reactions, bisulfite-DNA is required not only for the methylation reaction, but also for the ALU-C4 control reaction. We also include bisulfite converted M.SssI-treated DNA \\(diluted 1:10 \\(in duplicate)) for each methylation and control reaction. We use 10\u00b5l of DNA for each PCR reaction, and analyze the five CIMP-specific methylation reactions on 10 DNA samples per 96-well plate. For example, we need 70 \u00b5l of bisulfite-converted sample DNA for each set of 5 CIMP reactions:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n50 \u00b5l for 5 methylation reactions \\(10 \u00b5l/reaction)\r\n\n\n10 \u00b5l for the first ALU-C4 methylation control reaction\r\n\n\n10 \u00b5l for the second \\(duplicate) ALU-C4 methylation control reaction\r\n\n\n70 \u00b5l TOTAL/96-well plate for a set of five reactions \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNOTE: Although 70 \u00b5l is the calculated amount, a larger volume should be used to compensate for pipetting errors and repeat analyses. We usually budget 100 \u00b5l Bisulfite DNA sample/set of five CIMP reactions \\(and the ALU control reaction in duplicate) \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Bisulfite converted M.SssI-treated DNA \\(approximately 160 \u00b5l) is also required \\(2 aliquots of 10 \u00b5l for each of the seven reactions plus >20 \u00b5l for the standard curves). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA. Standard Curve Set-up:\r\n\n\n\u2022 Finally, a 4-point standard curve over 6 wells is included in duplicate \\(a total of 12 wells of a 96-well plate). \r\n\n\n1. For the ALU-C4 standard curve, we use bisulfite converted M.SssI-modified DNA \\(diluted 1:10). From this initial stock of bisulfite converted M.SssI-modified DNA, we perform 1:25 serial dilutions. The ALU-based standard curve is set-up in duplicate. A volume of 10 \u00b5l of each dilution should be used per PCR reaction well. The 6 wells that comprise one standard curve are as follows: \r\n  \r\n\n\nALU-C4 CONTROL REACTION SET-UP:\r\n\n\nM.SssI-modified DNA \\(1:10 dilution after bisulfite conversion) 10 \u00b5l needed/plate\r\n\n\nA 1:25 dilution of sample #1 \\(in duplicate); 20 \u00b5l needed/plate\r\n\n\nA 1:25 dilution of sample #2 \\(in duplicate); 20 \u00b5l needed/plate\r\n\n\nA 1:25 dilution of sample #3; 10 \u00b5l needed/plate\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe actual volumes of DNA needed are double that for a single standard curve, as this is set-up in duplicate as well. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 If these plates are loaded manually \\(versus automated methods of plate loading), then the stocks of the dilution standards may require different volumes.\r\n\n\n\u2022 The dilution of the bisulfite-converted M.SssI DNA sample \\(approximately to 800-1000 \u00b5l) is usually sufficient for four MethyLight plates \\(positive controls for each methylation reaction and standard curves).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nB. Reaction MasterMix Set-up:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022ANALYSES PER PLATE: Ten \\(10) DNA samples and two M.SssI-modified DNA samples. For each DNA sample and M.SssI-modified DNA, the following reactions will be included on each 96-well plate:\r\n\n\n1. The panel of five CIMP-specific methylation reactions\r\n  2.

MethyLight PMR calculations:\r\n  \u2022 The formula to calculate PMR values is essentially the quotient of two ratios \\(multiplied by 100):\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(\\[geneX mean value for the sample]/\\[Alu mean value for the sample]) / \\(\\[geneX mean value for the M.SssI reference]/\\[Alu mean value for the M.SssI reference]) * 100\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Once the real-time PCR program is finished, the C\\(t) values are converted to mean values/copy numbers via the standard curve for each plate. The log \\(fluorescence) is plotted as a function of the C\\(t) values of each standard, and the equation of the best fit line through the points that comprise the standard curve is generated. Then, the C\\(t) value of each unknown sample is converted to a \u201cmean value\u201d via the standard curve best fit equation. Once these adjusted values are obtained, the PMR calculations can be made:\r\n\n\n1. With the first ALU-C4 control reaction selected, divide the mean/copy value for the methylation reaction of the sample of interest by the mean/copy value of the first Alu control reaction for that sample.\r\n  2. Then divide the mean/copy value for each M.SssI sample for each methylation reaction by the mean/copy value for the first Alu reaction for each sample and then average this quotient.\r\n  3. Divide the value from step #1 by the value from step #2 and multiply that value by 100. This is the PMR value.\r\n  4. Since we use the ALU-C4 control reaction and standard curve in duplicate, we can calculate two sets of PMR values using each control reaction and standard curve separately. After calculating the PMR values specific for the first ALU-C4 control and standard curve, simply re-assign the second ALU-C4 standard curve wells as standards, then find the values from steps #1 and #2 from above, but using the second ALU-C4 control reaction mean/copy values. The PMR values from each quantitation can then be averaged to generate a final PMR value for each sample.\r\n  5. We consider a PMR>10 for a given sample and locus to be positive for methylation, and we define a sample as CIMP positive \\(CIMP+) if it has \u22653 of the 5 CIMP markers with PMR>10. If the sample has \u22642 of the five markers with PMR>10, it is considered to be CIMP negative \\(CIMP-)."
