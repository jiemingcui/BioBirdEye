            "content": "Three-dimensional \u201corganoid\u201d culture techniques have been used for culture of stem/progenitor cells from tissues including the small intestine, stomach, liver and pancreas<sup>1-4</sup>. We have developed a novel method for the culture of prostate epithelial organoids that display tissue architecture resembling that of the normal prostate<sup>5</sup>. Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of prostate luminal cells, which have historically been difficult to grow, and differs from previous \u201cprostasphere\u201d conditions, which favor the growth of prostate basal cells and fail to display a response to androgen deprivation<sup>6</sup>. In particular, our organoid culture conditions allow for the growth of prostate organoids from single luminal stem/progenitor cells, as well as mouse tumor organoids, and thus should be widely applicable for studies of prostate biology. Notably, our culture methods are distinct from recently published conditions for prostate organoid culture using defined media conditions<sup>7, 8</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn the following protocol, we describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, the isolation of epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting \\(FACS) using antibodies against epithelial cell adhesion molecule \\(EpCAM, also CD326) and epithelial cadherin \\(E-cadherin, also CD324), and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture using supplemented hepatocyte medium with 5% Matrigel. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing."

            "content": "**Critical:** The volumes detailed below are for dissociation of an intact prostate from an 8-12 week wild type mouse. For larger prostate samples such as those from aggressive tumor models, all reagents should be increased proportionally from the volumes suggested below. For example, if a prostate tumor is approximately twice the size of a wild type prostate, 2x the volume of suggested reagents should be used. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2.1. Prostate dissection and collagenase digestion\r\n\n\n1. In tissue culture hood, combine 200 \u00b5L 10x collagenase/hyaluronidase mixture with 1.8 mL DMEM/F12 + 5% FBS.  Place in 37\u00b0C water bath until ready to use.\r\n  2. Resect mouse prostates and transfer to sterile petri dish containing cold PBS for dissection6. Using a dissecting microscope, fine forceps, and sharp scissors, remove residual fat from prostate tissue.\r\n  3. Fill 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of diluted pre-warmed collagenase/hyaluronidase solution and transfer prostate tissue into the tube.\r\n  4. Using small, sharp sterile scissors, macerate the prostate tissue by rapidly opening and closing the scissors inside the tube to cut the tissue into small pieces.  Fill the tube with an additional 400-500 \u00b5L dilute collagenase/hyaluronidase solution until almost full.\r\n  5. Incubate in 37\u00b0C incubator for 3 hours. \\(**Tip:** The Eppendorf tube may be placed on its side in a sterile petri dish to maximize the surface area of prostate tissue exposed to collagenase/hyaluronidase solution. Periodic shaking of the tube to redistribute prostate tissue is helpful.)\r\n  \r\n\n\n2.2. Enzymatic dissociation to single cell suspension\r\n\n\n1. Centrifuge digested tissue at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant.\r\n  2. Resuspend pellet in 1.5 mL cold 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and transfer to 50 mL conical tube. Incubate in 4\u00b0C refrigerator for 1 hour. \\(**Caution:** To minimize cell death, keep trypsin \u2264 4\u00b0C prior to and during use. Trypsin can be gently thawed overnight with Matrigel and kept on ice. An orbital shaker can be used during the trypsinization step for optimal digestion.)\r\n  3. During trypsinization, place 900 \u00b5L dispase in 37\u00b0C water bath at least 10 minutes prior to use. Immediately before use, add 100 \u00b5L DNaseI to dispase solution.   \r\n  4. After trypsinization is complete \\(1 hour), add cold HBSS + 2% FBS \\(equal to 2x volume of trypsin) to quench reaction. Centrifuge at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant.\r\n  5. Add 1 mL of pre-warmed dispase/DNaseI solution. Pipette the sample vigorously for 1-2 minutes using P1000 pipette until solution is homogenously translucent with no visible tissue fragments. \\(Do not allow digestion to continue for more than 2 minutes.) \\(**Critical:** To maximize cell dissociation, this pipetting step should be done continuously.)\r\n  6. Add cold HBSS + 2% FBS \\(equal to 5x volume of dispase) to quench reaction.  \r\n  7. Filter cell suspension through a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube.\r\n  8. Centrifuge filtered suspension at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant.\r\n  9. Resuspend pellet in 1 mL HBSS + 2% FBS and transfer to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\r\n  10. Count viable cells using a hemacytometer and trypan blue. \r\n  11. Centrifuge and resuspend cells in HBSS + 2% FBS at 100 \u00b5L/1 x 10\n6\ncells. \\(If fewer than 1 x 10\n6\ncells are obtained, resuspend in 100 \u00b5L)\r\n  \r\n\n\n2.3. Fluorescence activated cell sorting \\(FACS)\r\n\n\n*Keep cell suspension and reagents on ice until sorting is finished. \r\n\n\n1. Divide cell suspension into four 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes as follows \r\n  a. Tube 1 \\(unstained control): 100 \u00b5L \\(1x10\n6\ncells)\r\n\n\nb. Tube 2 \\(PerCP control): 100 \u00b5L \\(1x10\n6\ncells)\r\n\n\nc. Tube 3 \\(APC control): 100 \u00b5L \\(1x10\n6\ncells)\r\n\n\nd. Tube 4 \\(sample for collection): remaining sample  \\(up to 1 mL)\r\n\n\n2. Add FACS antibodies as follows:\r\n  a. Tube 1: no antibody\r\n\n\nb. Tube 2: 1 \u00b5L \\(1:100) anti-mouse E-cadherin PerCP-Efluor710 antibody\r\n\n\nc. Tube 3: 1 \u00b5L \\(1:100) anti-mouse APC-EpCAM antibody\r\n\n\nd. Tube 4: both antibodies at 1:100 dilution \\(1 \u00b5L antibody per 100 \u00b5L cell suspension).\r\n\n\n\\(**Critical:** If fewer than 4 x 106 cells are obtained after enzymatic dissociation, use 10 \u00b5L of cell suspension for control tubes 1-3 and dilute with 90 \u00b5L HBSS + 2% FBS for a total of 100 \u00b5L. Use the same antibody concentrations. Resuspend tubes 1-3 in 50 \u00b5L cold HBSS + 2% FBS instead of 500 \u00b5L in step 6 of cell sorting and use 1 \u00b5L of dilute DAPI instead of 10 \u00b5L.)\r\n\n\n3. Cover with foil and incubate on ice for 25 minutes.\r\n  4. Spin tubes at 350 rcf at 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes and discard supernatant.\r\n  5. Add 500 \u00b5L cold HBSS + 2% FBS to all tubes.  Spin at 350 rcf at 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes and discard supernatant.\r\n  6. Resuspend all tubes in 500 \u00b5L cold HBSS + 2% FBS + 10 \u00b5M ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.\r\n  7. Prepare a 1:100 dilution of 0.5 mg/mL DAPI by adding 5 \u00b5L DAPI to 495 \u00b5L HBSS + 2% FBS. Add 10 \u00b5L of dilute DAPI to each tube.\r\n  8. Transfer each suspension into a labeled round-bottom clear rubber-top plastic test tube for loading into sorter.\r\n  9. Prior to sorting, prepare multiple 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes pre-filled with 500 \u00b5L cold HBSS + 2% FBS + 10 \u00b5M ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 for collecting cells.\r\n  10. Perform sorting via sterile FACS facility \\(tubes 1-3 will be used to set appropriate gates; tube 4 will be used to collect cells for plating). Collecting cells at 60,000 cells per tube will facilitate easier plating. Keep collected cells on ice until ready to plate.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2.4.  Medium preparation and cell plating\r\n\n\n1. Prepare desired amount of culture medium by combining the following components to the indicated final concentrations \\(a-d can be combined and stored as a 50 mL aliquot at 4\u00b0C for up to 4 weeks; e-h should be added on the day of use based on the amount of media needed):\r\n  a. Hepatocyte medium \\(47 mL per 50 mL media)\r\n\n\nb. 10 ng/mL EGF \\(100 \u00b5L of 5 \u00b5g/mL stock per 50 mL media)\r\n\n\nc. 5% heat-inactivated, charcoal-stripped FBS \\(2.5 mL per 50 mL media)\r\n\n\nd. 1x Glutamax \\(500 \u00b5L per 50 mL media)\r\n\n\ne. 5% Matrigel \\(50 \u00b5L per 1 mL media)\r\n\n\nf. 10 \u00b5M ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 \\(2 \u00b5L of 5 mM stock per 1 mL media)\r\n\n\ng. 100 nM DHT \\(10 \u00b5L of 10\n-5\nM stock per 1 mL media)\r\n\n\nh. 1x antibiotic-antimycotic \\(10 \u00b5L per 1 mL media; optional)\r\n\n\n2. Keep prepared culture media at room temperature until use \\(rapid warming in 37\u00b0C water bath may cause Matrigel to solidify at top of tube).\r\n  3. Centrifuge sorted cells at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspend in prepared media at 5,000 cells per 100 \u00b5L media. \\(If cells were collected at 60,000 cells per Eppendorf tube, resuspend in 1.2 mL media. If there is concern for cell death, count viable cells prior to centrifuging and resuspend accordingly.)\r\n  4. Add resuspended cells to 96-well low attachment plate at 100 \u00b5L per well for a final plating density of 5,000 cells per well.\r\n  5. Change media every 4 days by adding 100 \u00b5L fresh media to each well on days 4 and 8 after plating. On day 12, when wells are full \\(300 \u00b5L), transfer each well to a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. Remove 200 \u00b5L of supernatant and add 100 \u00b5L fresh media \\(total volume will be 200 \u00b5L).  Transfer onto a new 96-well plate using P1000 pipet tip \\(smaller tips may damage organoids). Alternate every 4 days between either adding 100 \u00b5L media or spinning down to remove 200 \u00b5L and add 100 \u00b5L until ready for passage. \\(Multiple wells can be pooled prior to centrifuging and redistributed evenly if there are many wells.)\r\n  \r\n\n\n2.5. Cell plating using embedding conditions\r\n\n\n1. Medium preparation is the same as in 2.4.1 except that component e is not added. Media can be pre-warmed in a 37\u00b0C water bath. This pre-warmed media will be used to cover the solidified Matrigel ring in 2.5.7.\r\n  2. Prepare cold media as in 2.4.1 except that component e is not added and f is at a final concentration of 25 \u00b5M \\(5 \u00b5L of 5 mM stock per 1 mL media). Keep this media on ice and it will be used to resuspend cells. \r\n  3. Pellet cells as in 2.4.3 and resuspend in prepared cold media at 5,000 cells per 40 \u00b5L media. \\(If cells were collected at 60,000 cells per Eppendorf tube, resuspend in 480 \u00b5L media.) \\(**Tip:** For the embedding condition, the number of cells plated can be much lower.)\r\n  4. Mix the 40 \u00b5L media containing cells thoroughly with 60 \u00b5l Matrigel \\(If 60,000 cells are resuspended in 480 \u00b5L media, mix with 720 \u00b5L Matrigel). Avoid bubbles. This step should be done on ice to prevent Matrigel solidification.\r\n  5. Plate the 100 \u00b5L media Matrigel mixture around the ring of a well in a 24-well plate. \r\n  6. Incubate the 24-well plate in 37\u00b0C incubator for 30 minutes to allow the Matrigel ring to solidify.\r\n  7. Add 400 \u00b5L pre-warmed media as prepared in 2.5.1 to each well. \\(**Critical:** Make sure that the media is warm enough prior to addition to the well to avoid dissolving the Matrigel ring.)\r\n  8. Change media every 4 days by aspirating the media off the Matrigel ring and adding fresh media. \\(**Tip:** Aspiration should be performed from the middle of the well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel ring.)\r\n  \r\n\n\n2.6. Passaging and freezing organoids\r\n\n\n1. When organoids are large \\(usually 3-5 weeks after plating), prepare organoids for passage by transferring into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and spinning at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. \\(Multiple wells can be pooled.)  Discard supernatant.\r\n  2. Wash cells in cold PBS and spin again at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. \\(Critical: Without this PBS washing step, the trypsin reaction will not be optimal due to residual FBS in the medium, resulting in incomplete dissociation into single cells.) \r\n  3. Add 1 mL warm 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and incubate in a 37\u00b0C water bath for 5 minutes. \\(Tip: In the context of very large organoids or organoids that are difficult to dissociate, step 3 can be replaced by incubation in cold 0.25% trypsin/EDTA at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes.) \r\n  4. Pipette up and down with P200 pipet tip for 30 seconds to dissociate cells.\r\n  5. Transfer suspension into a 15 mL conical tube prefilled with 2 mL cold HBSS + 2% FBS.\r\n  6. Centrifuge at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant.\r\n  7. Resuspend cell pellet in fresh media and plate into a new low-attachment 96-well plate.  Cells can be plated by either replating 4x the number of wells passaged in 100 \u00b5L per well or by counting viable cells and replating at 5,000 cells/100 \u00b5L media per well.\r\n  8. Organoids can be frozen at any point during a passage cycle by centrifuging at 250 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspending in 1 mL freezing media in 1.8 mL cryo tubes \\(50% FBS, 40% hepatocyte media, 10% DMSO).  Gradual freezing to \u2264 -80\u00b0 using an insulated cryofreezing container is recommended. Organoids should be thawed rapidly in a 37\u00b0C water bath and immediately diluted in 10 mL HBSS + 2% FBS per 1 mL freezing media. Centrifuge thawed organoids at 250 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspend in organoid culture media for plating.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2.7. Passaging and freezing of embedded organoids\r\n\n\n1. Dissolve the Matrigel ring by adding about 125 \u00b5L dispase at 5 mg/mL to each well of the 24-well plate to make the final concentration of dispase 1 mg/ml.\r\n  2. Incubate in 37\u00b0C incubator for 10 minutes. \r\n  3. If the Matrigel ring dissolves, proceed as in 2.6.1. If not, incubate at 37\u00b0C for another 5 minutes."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "This protocol describes a novel three-dimensional \u201corganoid\u201d culture for prostate epithelial cells. We describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, the isolation of epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting, and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing. The dissection and dissociation of prostate tissue and the preparation of cells for plating takes 8-9 hours. Organoids that can be quantified and analyzed are obtained after 7-10 days. Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of both normal and transformed organoids, and should be useful for studies of normal prostate as well as prostate cancer.",
