            "content": "CAUTIONARY NOTES OR SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Current density across the cell culture insert membrane is more uniform with the EndOhm cup compared to the chopstick electrode (WPI #STX2).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Variation between repeated measurements of the same sample is expected to be 1-2 W compared to 10-30 W with the chopstick electrode.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Check and adjust electrode height prior to each experiment.\u00a0In general, lowering of the electrode will decrease TEER values while raising it will increase TEER readings.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The EndOhm can be used for resistance measurements without conditioning of the electrode.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calibration of the EVOM2 instrument should be checked as described below prior to easy use.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The medium volumes indicated for the EndOhm cup were selected to comply with the specifications indicated by the manufacturer in the EndOhm user manual.\u00a0Note that the medium inside and outside the cell culture insert should be at the same level to avoid hydrostatic pressure on the membrane.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EBSS is used instead of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) because the tonicity of EBSS is more similar to culture medium than PBS.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same cell culture medium should be used inside and outside the cell culture insert to avoid the creation of an ionic gradient between the two compartments when measuring resistance.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If using the EVOM2 instrument for repeated measurements over times greater than 3 hours, the EVOM2 can be recharged over 30-minute periods by disconnecting the chamber connecting wires. In the event that you have <30 minutes to recharge, recharge periodically when possible while remembering to disconnect the charging cable between measurements.\n10. When taking samples out of an incubator to run TEER with intent to keep the samples, prepare and measure smaller groups of Transwell inserts at a time so that measured samples can be aspirated and replaced into the controlled environment of the incubator more quickly. For endpoint measurements where cells will not be kept, working quickly but with larger groups of Transwell inserts is acceptable.\n11. Read the Tergazyme SDS sheet prior to cleaning the EndOhm chamber and wear protective gloves, protective clothing, eye protection, and face protection while cleaning the EndOhm chamber.\nPROCEDURE\nInstrument set-up\n1. Ensure that the EVOM2 unit is fully charged.\nNOTE:\nPlug the EVOM2 unit into an electrical outlet for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight, before beginning your TEER assay.\nNOTE:\nTaking TEER measurements while the EVOM2 unit is plugged into an electrical outlet can increase variability in your samples.\n2. Assemble the EndOhm cup with a representative cell culture insert to confirm that the height of the electrode is 1-2 mm above the surface of the insert membrane.\u00a0If necessary, adjust the electrode height by loosening the locking nut, turning the electrode clockwise or counterclockwise to lower or raise the electrode, respectively, and re-tightening the locking nut (Figure 1).\nInstrument Calibration\n1. Ensure that the EVOM2 unit is fully charged and unplug from external power.\nNOTE:\nPlug the EVOM2 unit into an electrical outlet for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight, before beginning your TEER assay\nNOTE:\nTaking TEER measurements while the EVOM2 unit is plugged into an electrical outlet can increase variability in your samples\n2.\u00a0Assemble the EVOM2 (Figure 2A), 1000 W test resistor (Figure 2B), and adjustment screwdriver that was provided with the EVOM2 purchase (Figure 2C).\n3.\u00a0Place the FUNCTION toggle switch into the OHMS position (Figure 2A, circle).\n4.\u00a0Plug the 1000 W test resistor into the INPUT port (Figure 2D, arrow) then turn the instrument power on by placing the POWER switch into the closed (\u201cI\u201d) position (Figure 2D, circle).\n5.\u00a0Allow approximately five seconds for the ohms reading to stabilize (Figure 2D, box).\n6.\u00a0If the ohms reading is higher or lower than 1000 then adjust the calibration by turning the R ADJ screw (clockwise to increase and counterclockwise to decrease) with the screwdriver until the reading is 1000 (Figure 2E).\nSetup and Preparation of Reagents\n1.\u00a0Equilibrate aliquots of cell culture media (identical formulation to the medium in the basolateral compartment in differentiated primary human airway epithelial models) and EBSS at room temperature for 60-120 minutes.\n2.\u00a0Plug the EVOM2 connecting wires into the EndOhm cup.\nCleaning the EndOhm Before Sample Measurement\n1.\u00a0Rinse the EndOhm cup with deionized water and aspirate.\n2.\u00a0Add distilled water to the EndOhm cup, replace the top, and allow the electrodes to soak for two minutes.\n3.\u00a0Aspirate the water and dry both electrodes using Kimwipes, or another lint-free absorbent wipe.\nNOTE:\nIf required, a cotton swab can be used for cleaning.\u00a0Do not use anything more abrasive than a cotton swab to clean the EndOhm.\n4.\u00a0Allow the EndOhm to air dry before use.\nMeasuring Blank Resistance\nNOTE:\nBlank resistance can be measured at either the beginning or end of the experiment.\n1.\u00a0Unplug the EVOM2 from external power and remove charging cable.\n2.\u00a0Confirm that the FUNCTION switch is in the OHMS position (Figure 3A).\n3.\u00a0Add room temperature cell culture media to the empty EndOhm cup (Figure 3B).\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EndOhm 6: add 1.5 mL using a 5 mL pipet.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EndOhm 12: add 3 mL using a 5 mL pipet.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EndOhm 24: add 5 mL using a 5 mL pipet.\n4.\u00a0Place the blank insert into a multi-well plate and add cell culture media to the apical compartment (Figure 3C).\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.5 mm insert in EndOhm 6: add 250 \u03bcL using a P1000 pipette.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a012 mm insert in EndOhm 12: add 500 \u03bcL using a P1000 pipette.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a024 mm insert in EndOhm 24: add 2.5 mL using a 5 mL pipet.\n5.\u00a0Transfer the blank insert into the EndOhm cup (Figure 3D).\n6.\u00a0Check for bubbles underneath the insert after placement in the EndOhm cup (Figure 3E).\u00a0If bubbles are present, then the insert can be adjusted to allow the bubbles to surface.\n7.\u00a0Check for bubbles in the apical compartment of the insert after placement of the EndOhm cap (Figure 3F).\u00a0If bubbles are present, then carefully pop them with a pipette tip or by holding an aspirator tip slightly above them.\n8.\u00a0Turn the EVOM2 POWER switch to the on (\u201cI\u201d) position (Figure 3G).\nNOTE:\nThe blank resistance readings should stabilize within 3-4 seconds\nNOTE:\nWhen turning on the EVOM2, the apparatus will display several numbers in sequence before displaying the resistance readings. These numbers should be 0, a negative value (~ -500 to -750), a high positive value (~13460), a higher positive value that will flash twice (~14080), and finally the resistance measurements as they fluctuate and stabilize.\n9.\u00a0Discard blank insert.\u00a0Blank inserts should not be re-used.\nMeasuring Sample Resistance\n1.\u00a0Unplug the EVOM2 from external power and remove charging cable.\n2.\u00a0Confirm that the FUNCTION switch is in the OHMS position (Figure 3A).\n3.\u00a0Plug the EVOM2 connecting wires into the EndOhm cup.\n4.\u00a0Add room temperature cell culture media to the empty EndOhm cup (Figure 3B).\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EndOhm 6: add 1.5 mL using a 5 mL pipet.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EndOhm 12: add 3 mL using a 5 mL pipet.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EndOhm 24: add 5 mL using a 5 mL pipet.\n5.\u00a0Remove samples in multi-well plate from the cell culture incubator to the benchtop.\n6.\u00a0Wash the inserts in the plate being prepared for measurement by adding room temperature EBSS (volumes indicated below) to the apical compartment then carefully remove the EBSS by aspiration.\u00a0Do not include an incubation period after addition of the EBSS.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.5 mm insert in EndOhm 6: add 300 \u03bcL using a P1000 pipette.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a012 mm insert in EndOhm 12: add 500 \u03bcL using a P1000 pipette.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a024 mm insert in EndOhm 24: add 2.5 mL using a 5 mL pipet.\nNOTE:\nApply EBSS by placing the pipette tip in contact with the inner wall of the insert and then slowly dispensing (Figure 3C, middle panel).\nNOTE:\nAlternatively, the EBSS can be collected as an apical wash sample.\n7.\u00a0Gently add room temperature cell culture media (volumes indicated below) to the inserts in the plate being prepared for measurement.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.5 mm insert in EndOhm 6: add 250 \u03bcL using a P1000 pipette.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a012 mm insert in EndOhm 12: add 500 \u03bcL using a P1000 pipette.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a024 mm insert in EndOhm 24: add 2.5 mL using a 5 mL pipet.\nNOTE:\nApply medium by placing the pipette tip in contact with the inner wall of the insert and then slowly dispensing the medium (Figure 3C, middle panel).\n8.\u00a0Allow samples to equilibrate by incubation at room temperature for 30 seconds.\n9.\u00a0Transfer the first insert to be measured into the EndOhm cup.\n10. Check for bubbles underneath the insert after placement in the EndOhm cup (Figure 3E).\u00a0If bubbles are present, then the insert can be adjusted to allow the bubbles to surface.\n11. Check for bubbles in the apical compartment of the insert after placement of the EndOhm cap (Figure 3F).\u00a0If bubbles are present, then carefully pop them with a pipette tip or by holding an aspirator tip slightly above them.\n12. Turn the EVOM2 POWER switch to the on (\u201cI\u201d) position.\nNOTE:\nWhen turning on the EVOM2, the apparatus will display several numbers in sequence before displaying the resistance value. These numbers should be 0, a negative value (~ -500 to -750), a high positive value (~13460), a higher positive value that will flash twice (~14080), and then the resistance value, which may fluctuate slightly.\n13. Turn the EVOM2 POWER switch to the off (\u201cO\u201d) position and exchange sample inserts and repeat steps 9-12 for the remaining inserts that have been prepared for measurement.\n14.
