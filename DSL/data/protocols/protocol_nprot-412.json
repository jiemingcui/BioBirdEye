            "content": "Presently, hundreds of monoclonal antibodies \\(mAbs) and mAb fragments are under clinical development because of their excellent potential for the systemic treatment of cancer and other pathological conditions<sup>1, 2</sup>. Positron emission tomography \\(PET) offers an exciting imaging option to confirm and quantify selective tumor uptake of such targeting molecules<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\n\nTo enable PET imaging of mAbs \\(immuno-PET), an appropriate positron emitter, with a half-life \\(t<sub>1/2</sub>) that is compatible with the time needed to achieve optimal tumor-to-nontumor ratios \\(typically 2-4 days for intact mAbs), has to be securely coupled to the targeting molecule. For this purpose we recently described the large scale production of pure zirconium-89 \\(<sup>89</sup>Zr; t<sub>1/2</sub>: 78.4 h) and a strategy for labeling mAbs with <sup>89</sup>Zr via a multi-step synthesis using a succinylated-derivative of desferrioxamine B \\(Df) as bifunctional chelate<sup>4</sup>. The utility of this approach was clearly demonstrated through high quality <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb-PET images reported in preclinical and clinical studies<sup>5-11</sup>. The upcoming commercialization of <sup>89</sup>Zr will make this radionuclide generally available for research and clinical development.\r\n\n\nA shortcoming of the aforementioned approach is that the multi-step procedure is relatively complicated and time consuming. In this updated protocol we present the newly developed p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-derivative of Df \\(SCN-Bz-Df; Macrocyclics, TX) which provides an efficient and rapid preparation of <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled mAbs. First, SCN-Bz-Df is coupled to the amine groups of a protein at pH 9.0, followed by purification using gel filtration. Next, the conjugate is labeled at room temperature by addition of a solution of <sup>89</sup>Zr oxalic acid followed by purification using gel filtration. SCN-Bz-Df can also be utilized to label proteins at room temperature with gallium-68 \\(<sup>68</sup>Ga; t<sub>1/2</sub>: 1.13 h). <sup>68</sup>Ga is especially attractive for PET-imaging of fast kinetic targeting proteins like mAb fragments."
