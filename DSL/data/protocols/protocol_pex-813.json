The procedure takes 2 days from recovery of gametes/embryos from the mouse to imaging of samples in a confocal microscope. The procedure uses bent capillaries and a mouth pipette with a filter, allowing for movement of the samples between solutions following necessary incubation times. This simple procedure works quite efficiently and is an easy skill to master with the availability of the necessary tools. </p>",
