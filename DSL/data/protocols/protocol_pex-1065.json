            "content": "<p>The spatiotemporal control of gene expression is orchestrated in part by distally located DNA</p><p>sequences known as enhancers. The first viral and cellular enhancers were identified by cloning</p><p>fragments of DNA into a plasmid with a reporter gene and promoter 1\u20134 . Enhancement of</p><p>transcription in such a reporter assay is a widely used approach for evaluating whether a putative</p><p>regulatory element is a bona fide enhancer. However, conventional, one-at-a-time reporter assays</p><p>are insufficiently scalable to test the &amp;gt;1 million putative enhancers in the human genome 5\u20138 .</p><p><br></p><p>Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) modify the in vitro reporter assays described above</p><p>to facilitate simultaneous testing of thousands of putative regulatory elements or variants</p><p>thereof 9\u201311 in a single experiment. Instead of relying on measurement of a conventional reporter,</p><p>MPRAs characterize each element in a multiplex fashion, through sequence-based quantification</p><p>of barcodes incorporated into the RNA, each associated with a different element 9\u201315 . MPRAs (a</p><p>term we use broadly to encompass related methods including STARR-seq 16 and lentiMPRAs 17 )</p><p>have facilitated the scalable study of putative regulatory elements for goals ranging from</p><p>functional annotation 16\u201318 to variant effect prediction 10\u201315,19 to evolutionary reconstruction 20,21 .</p><p><br></p><p>To date, several groups have implemented enhancer-focused MPRAs, but with diverse designs.</p><p>Some of the major differences include whether the enhancer is upstream 10,11 vs. within the 3\u2032\u2009UTR of the reporter gene 16 , and whether the construct remains episomal vs. integrated 17 .</p><p>Additionally, most MPRAs test sequences cloned in one of two possible orientations, effectively</p><p>assuming that enhancer activity is independent of orientation. Finally, while larger sheared</p><p>genomic DNA fragments 16,22 , PCR amplicons 12 or captured sequences 23,24 have been used in</p><p>MPRAs, most studies using MPRAs synthesize libraries of candidate enhancers on microarrays,</p><p>and are therefore limited to testing shorter sequences (typically less than 200 bp).</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, we have, as a field to date, largely failed to evaluate how these design choices</p><p>impact or bias the results of MPRAs. First, although assays like STARR-seq wherein the</p><p>enhancer serves as the barcode are more straightforward to implement, our understanding of how</p><p>position (3\u2032 of the promoter, rather than 5\u2032 as in a more conventional reporter assay vector) or the</p><p>fact that the sequence is serving as the barcode, influences results, remains incomplete. Arnold et</p><p>al. notably benchmarked STARR-seq against 142 conventional luciferase assays (r = 0.83), but</p><p>STARR-seq has yet to be systematically compared to other MPRAs 16 . Second, although we</p><p>previously showed differences between episomal vs. integrated MPRAs 17 , it is not clear how</p><p>these differences rank relative to those resulting from other design choices. Third, although the</p><p>orientation-independence of enhancers has been evaluated in Drosophila 16,25,26 , to our knowledge</p><p>the robustness of this assumption has not previously been systematically tested in a mammalian</p><p>system. Finally, the typical choice to test &amp;lt;200 bp fragments, each corresponding to a putative</p><p>enhancer, is entirely based on technical limitations of massively parallel DNA synthesis, rather than on any principled understanding of the actual size of enhancers. The consequences of this</p><p>choice for the results obtained remain largely unquantified.</p><p><br></p><p>Particularly as efforts to validate the &gt;1 million putative human enhancers 5\u20138 , as well as the</p><p>growing number of disease-associated noncoding variants, begin to scale, a clear-eyed</p><p>understanding of the biases and tradeoffs introduced by various MPRA experimental design</p><p>choices is needed. To this end, we performed a systematic comparison, testing the same 2,440</p><p>sequences for regulatory activity using nine different MPRA strategies, including conventional</p><p>episomal, STARR-seq, and lentiviral designs. Second, we tested the same sequences in both</p><p>orientations relative to the promoter. Finally, we further developed our multiplex pairwise</p><p>assembly protocol 27, and applied it to test short (192 bp), medium (354 bp), and long (678 bp)</p><p>versions of the same enhancers. Our results quantify the impact of MPRA experimental design</p><p>choices and also provide further insight into the nature of enhancers.</p>"

The sequencing reads were downsampled to normalize for the total number of targets (#Reads=581*#Targets). The Y axis is the number of downsampled reads from a given target sequence. C) One sub-library (of 172 targets), was sequenced on a PacBio Sequel. The plot shows the uniformity for all aligning reads (black) and indel-free reads (grey). D) Composition of the sub-library of 172 targets. The first column shows the breakdown of oligos by Illumina sequencing.

To assemble fragments \u201cAB\u201d and CD\u201d, sequences were designed such that the 3\u2032 end of fragments A and C had 30 bps of homology to the 5\u2032 ends of fragments B and D, respectively (shown in red and orange). To remove adapter sequences from these ends of the fragments, uracil primers (shown in yellow) were used to incorporate uracils into the adapters during qPCR amplification. 2. The resulting fragments were treated with USER enzyme (scissors) and put into an end-repair reaction, 3. effectively removing the adapters. 4. Fragments were assembled in a qPCR reaction by allowing the fragments to first anneal to one another for 5 cycles of PCR without primers, and then adding primers targeting the 5\u2032 end of fragments A and C, and the 3\u2032 ends of fragments B and D, 5. resulting in fragments \u201cAB\u201d and \u201cCD\u201d. 6-9.

Here, we further develop and apply a novel method to assemble and functionally test libraries of greater than 2000 of the same putative enhancers as 192-mers, 354-mers, and 678-mers. We achieved a yield of 95% for 354-mers and 84% for 678-mers. Importantly, we observe surprisingly large differences in functional activity. This work provides a framework for the experimental design of high-throughput reporter assays, suggesting that the extended sequence context of tested elements, and to a lesser degree the precise assay, influence MPRA results.</p>",
