            "content": "AFG3L2 and paraplegin are cognate ATP-dependent metalloproteases that constitute the _m_-AAA protease complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation \\(CoIP) is a useful technique for the analysis of protein-protein interaction. Here, we illustrate a protocol to precipitate the complex formed by human epitope-tagged AFG3L2 and paraplegin heterologously expressed in the yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. The procedure employs polyclonal anti-AFG3L2 and anti-paraplegin, and monoclonal anti-HA antibodies to investigate the interaction between the two proteins. The protocol can be adapted to the analysis of other protein complexes."

Transfer overnight culture into 100 ml of YPD and incubate at 28\u00b0C with shaking. OD\n600 nm\nshould be 0.3-0.5 \\(=1 x 10\n7\ncell/ml)\r\n  2. Place cells in 50-ml tubes and centrifuge at 3,000g for 4 min at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  3. Discard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets by vortexing in 25 ml of sterile H\n2\nO. Combine two cell pellets and centrifuge at 3,000g for 2 min at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  4. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of 1X PBS. Transfer into 2-ml screw-cap eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 2,000g for 2 min at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  5. Discard the supernatant and store the pellet at -80\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**B) Resin and pre-saturated tube preparation**\r\n\n\n1. Pre-saturate Protein G Resin: place 20 \u03bcl of Protein G Resin per sample to be immunoprecipitated in one 1.5-ml eppendorf tube and add 1 ml of 1X PBS/BSA. Mix well. \r\n  2. Centrifuge at 800g for 2 min at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  3. Gently remove supernatant and wash three times with 1 ml of 1X PBS/BSA.\r\n  4.

Transfer 50 \u03bcl of each normalized cellular extract into a new eppendorf tube and add 10 \u03bcl of Loading Buffer. Heat samples at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. Store at -20\u00b0C \\(**INPUT** sample).\r\n  13.  Add primary antibody to normalized samples and incubate for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C under gentle shaking to allow formation of antigen-antibody complexes. \\(We use 10 \u03bcg of monoclonal anti-HA antibodies).\r\n  14.
