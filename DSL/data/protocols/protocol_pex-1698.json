            "content": "<p>Bilirubin is the product of heme catabolism occurring in all cells, with the highest contribution coming from splenic macrophages involved in the turnover of senescent erythrocytes. Bilirubin (BR) circulates in the blood as a reversible complex with serum albumin. It is selectively taken up into the liver, metabolized and excreted into the bile as bilirubin glucuronide (BRG) <sup>1</sup>.</p><p>The membrane transporter(s) for hepatic BR uptake is still unknown <sup>234</sup>. In both rats and humans, no significant correlation between drug-induced inhibition of hepatic SLCO1B1 and 1B3 transporters (OATP1B1 and OATP1B) and hyperbilirubinemia was found <sup>5</sup>, possibly due the participation of several additional factors in the whole organism.</p><p>This points to the need of applying a simplified model to investigate BR hepatic disposition.&nbsp;Among the various <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em> experimental models for the study of the liver function, the isolated and perfused rat liver (IPRL) presents the advantage of a fully intact architecture, preserving the critical feature of bile flow <sup>6</sup>, while enabling the control of the liver perfusion conditions, including the delivery of test compounds.</p><p>We have developed a protocol for the analysis of multiple single-pass events (up to 12) of sinusoidal BR uptake in the same preparation, by modifying the standard IPRL method <sup>7</sup>. This protocol can be implemented in a time window of approximately 25 min. The presence of BR and BRG was analyzed in &nbsp;the liver effluent by a fluorometric method <sup>8</sup>, with some adaptations. The preparation was viable and intact, as shown by both standard viability parameters and by the occurrence of bilirubin glucuronide hopping <sup>9</sup>.</p><p>This protocol offers the advantage of obtaining repeated observations in the same liver, thus reducing the number of animals. It offers therefore ample opportunity to screen molecules for their potential to inhibit hepatic BR and BRG membrane transporters.&nbsp;</p><p>TECHNICAL NOVELTIES</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfusion of the liver without oxygen supplementation at physiologically low flow rate.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeated intra-portal albumin-free boli of BR alone or with inhibitors of sinusoidal membrane transporters, so increasing the number of single-pass events in the same preparation, with animal reduction.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of FITC-labelled bovine serum albumin for the assessment of the intra-hepatic micro-vascular integrity.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct analysis of BR and BR glucuronide in the hepatic venous effluent by a high-throughput fluorometric assay.</p><p><br></p>"

Obtain the prior approval of animal experimentation from the competent bioethical authority. Justify the use of animals, by applying reasons for the 3R principles, e.g.:\n\u00a7\u00a0There are no\nin vitro\nexperimental models preserving the bile flow through the biliary system\n6\n(no available replacement).\n\u00a7\u00a0The procedure causes no sufferance to the anaesthetized rat (maximum achievable refinement).\n\u00a7\u00a0Repeated tests of BR (up to 12) can be performed in the same liver preparation, thus increasing the number of observations in the same liver, thus limiting the animal number (reduction by a factor of 10).\nAnaesthesia\nAnesthetize animals (> 220 g b.w.) by an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mL containing Zoletil (2 mg/kg body weight) and Xylazine (8 mg/kg body weight).\nSurgery\n\u00a7\u00a0Perform a horizontal laparotomy in the lower abdomen, by lifting the abdominal wall with the tweezers. Start the cut from the median point, continue towards each lateral side, and then turn vertically upwards, up to the lowest rib. Take care not to cut the diaphragm, the chest and its respiratory muscles at this stage.\n\u00a7\u00a0Displace the intestine to the left side to expose the hepatic hilus, with the portal vein and the common bile duct.\n\u00a7\u00a0Prepare a ligature around the inferior vena cava, above the insertion of the right renal vein, and a second one around the portal vein (about 1 cm distally from the hilus), using a two-strand sewing cotton thread.\n\u00a7\u00a0At this stage, consider to prepare the common bile duct for cannulation, if planned in the experiment (not described in this protocol).\n\u00a7\u00a0To prevent blood clotting, inject a bolus of heparin (500 U in 0.25 mL PBS) into the inferior vena cava by an insulin syringe.\n\u00a7\u00a0Activate the peristaltic pump at 1 mL/min in order to fill the silicon tubing with the perfusion solution. Allow it to leak dropwise.\n\u00a7\u00a0Insert the inlet catheter (20 G winged & ported) into the portal vein and secure it by tightening the ligature around the portal vein.\n\u00a7\u00a0Connect the inlet catheter to the \u201cperfusion tubing terminal\u201d (see above, Labware).\n\u00a7\u00a0Perfuse the liver at a flow rate of 4 ml/min and at a constant temperature of 37 \u00b0C.\n\u00a7\u00a0Incise the inferior vena cava caudally to the ligature, to allow blood and perfusion buffer to outflow from the liver, so to maintain normal intrahepatic pressure.\n\u00a7\u00a0Perform a thoracotomy starting from the diaphragm up to the neck, along two lateral lines.\n\u00a7\u00a0Insert the 18 G catheter through the right atrium into the inferior vena cava, secure it with a tight ligature.\n\u00a7\u00a0Connect the screw cap on the PEEK tubing (OD 2 mm, ID 1.8 mm) to this catheter, to collect the liver perfusion effluent.\n\u00a7\u00a0Close the inferior vena cava, above the tributary renal vein, by tightening the ligature, to prevent retrograde perfusion of the liver.\n\u00a7\u00a0Accelerate the peristaltic pump to deliver the intra-portal perfusion HBSS solution at 6 mL/min for 20 min (110 mL), to exsanguinate the liver and prepare it for BR uptake tests (read Tip 6).\n\u00a7\u00a0Switch the liver perfusion buffer from HBSS to PBS and perfuse until the effluent is clear (read Tip 7).\nBR AND BRG UPTAKE TESTS\nSinusoidal administration of BR and BR uptake inhibitors\n\u00a7\u00a0Prepare a set of at least 120 vials (1.5 ml) and 12 tubes (10 mL) for the collection of the effluent fractions.\n\u00a7\u00a0Insert a 1 mL-syringe, filled with 0.2 mL BR solution, into the bolus delivery port on the tubing connected to the inlet catheter (read Tips 8-9).\n\u00a7\u00a0Inject the BR bolus (0.2 mL) in 2 seconds and keep the syringe in place.\n\u00a7\u00a0Collect 10 effluent fractions (0.4 mL each; 4 sec/fraction) into 1.5 ml vials (read Tip 10).\n\u00a7\u00a0Remove the 1 mL-syringe from the portal cannula and continue the liver perfusion for 1 min (6 mL) before the next BR bolus and collect this inter-bolus fraction in a 15 mL-tube.\n\u00a7\u00a0Inject the second BR bolus (0.2. mL), as described above.\n\u00a7\u00a0Continue the liver perfusion for 1 min (6 mL), as above.\n\u00a7\u00a0Repeat BR boli injections up to 12 times.\nHEPATIC VENOUS EFFLUENT ANALYSIS\nBilirubin and Bilirubin glucuronide\nPerform the fluorometric analysis of BR by means of the Help-UnaG fusion protein (HUG)\n8\n, after fluorescence calibration with a BR standard solution. Check for interference of BR-specific fluorescence by the compounds added with BR. Analyze BRG as BR equivalents, after hydrolysis by \u03b2-Glucuronidase.\nAssay calibration\nCalibrate fluorescence intensity emitted by the HUG\u2022BR complex by incubating a HUG solution at a fixed concentration with serial bilirubin standard solutions. \u00a0HUG must be in molar excess of the highest BR concentration.\n\u00a7\u00a0Prepare 5 mM BR in DMSO (Solution A).\n\u00a7\u00a0Use Solution A to prepare 0.01 mM BR (Solution B) in PBS:DMSO (99.7:0.3, vol/vol) (read Tip 11).\n\u00a7\u00a0Use Solution B to prepare the series of standard BR solutions (0-0.05 \u00b5M in PBS:DMSO, \u00a099.7:0.3, vol/vol), as in Figure 2.\n\u00a7\u00a0Add 0.2 mL of each standard BR solution in a 96 well-plate containing 0.01 mL HUG solution (0.4 mg/mL; 6.62 \u00b5M, 66.2 pmoles) solution.\n\u00a7\u00a0Record fluorescence intensity in the microplate reader (\u03bb\nex\n= 485 nm; \u03bb\nem\n= 528 nm).\nAnalysis of assay interferences\nWhen planning to co-inject BR with other compounds via intra-portal boli, perform a prior check for their possible interference with the BR fluorometric assay (read Tip 12).\n\u00a7\u00a0Test the compounds at 1/10 their concentration in the bolus, to take account of their dilution in the sinusoids (read Tip 13).\n\u00a7\u00a0Use the concentrated solutions of compounds in DMSO, as described above (section bolus preparation): E17G, Indomethacin and Ketoprofen (50 mM); C3G, M3G, P3G, TC (100 mM); Pravastatin (300 mM).\n\u00a7\u00a0Dilute 10 \u00b5L of these concentrated solutions in 5 mL of standard BR as in the table below, to obtain BR standard solution containing 0.1 mM E17G or Indomethacin or Ketoprofen, 0.2 mM C3G or M3G or P3G or TC, and 0.6 mM Pravastatin, as in Figure 3.\nThe final solvent composition is PBS:DMSO (99.5:0.5, vol/vol). This has no effect on the HUG BR assay performance, while simplifying the preparation protocol. Fluorescence intensity of BR standard solutions ranges 0-26000 \u00b1 2700.\nSample analysis\n\u00a7\u00a0Prepare a 96-well plate, pre-filled with 0.010 mL HUG solution, setting aside 20 wells for serial dilutions of at least 5 standard BR solutions (0-50 nM range).\n\u00a7\u00a0Add 0.2 mL of each fraction to this 96-well plate.

Drill the cap of a 50-ml Falcon tube in 2 points, 0.5 cm apart. Insert a plastic tube connector (ID 2 mm) through each hole and secure it with hot glue.&nbsp;Fill the tube with approximately 40 mL buffer. Link the connector (IN direction) with the free end of the silicon tubing (OD 5 mm, ca. 30 cm) that plunges into the perfusion solution bottle to deliver the perfusion solution via the peristaltic pump. Fix the other connector (OUT direction) to the perfusion cannula. Position the trap cap down.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution temperature at outlet of the portal catheter will be 37-38\u00b0C.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prevents the tubing from sliding above the solution level.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support the perfusion of the peripheral areas of the liver, without increasing the perfusion flow, gently massage the liver surface.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shifting the portal perfusion solution from HBSS (bottle 1) to PBS (bottle 2), stop the peristaltic pump, fill the bubble trap with PBS and insert its OUT connector to the tubing delivering the perfusion solution, and then re-start the pump. At this point of the procedure, any solution flow stop is not critical for the liver perfusion.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind not to use the catheter port, but only the \u201cbolus delivery port\u201d (see Liver perfusion set-up). Fill the latter with 0.1 mL perfusion buffer before inserting the 1 mL-syringe, to avoid injecting an air bubble before the bolus.</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When injecting repeated boli, do not prefill the syringe with multiple bolus volumes (multiples of 0.2 mL), to avoid repeated mixing of the perfusion fluid with the syringe contents, leading to imprecise delivery of the compounds.</p><p>10.&nbsp;Bilirubin diluted in PBS to nM concentration is chemically unstable. Thus, transfer samples of the venous effluent to the HUG solution immediately after collection.</p><p>11.&nbsp;PBS, but not HBSS, is suitable for applying the analysis of BR in the perfusion effluent&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>.</p><p>12.&nbsp;Systematically check the interference of compounds delivered as intra-portal boli on the BR assay. Some compounds may interfere with fluorescence absorption and/or emission of the HUG-BR complex. These are anthocyanins different than C3G, such as malvidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-glucoside.</p><p>13.&nbsp;If the direct analysis of a given compound in the venous effluent of the liver is not possible, then indirectly estimate the highest boundary of the compound dilution by injecting a bolus of Albumin-FITC and analyze its concentration in the effluent fractions. Consider that a compound that is efficiently taken up may be more diluted than BSA-FITC.</p><p>14.&nbsp;Optimal BSA bolus is 77.5 \u00b5M BSA with 3% BSA-FITC, while lower [BSA] may result in unspecific adsorption of BSA-FITC and underestimation of recovery.</p><p>15.&nbsp;For implementing this protocol, three operators are needed: one expert in rat surgery, who performs liver perfusion and intra-portal delivery; one assistant to surgery and managing sample collection; one assistant to sample collection and immediate transfer to the BR assay.</p><p><br></p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>We present a protocol for the study of bilirubin uptake in the isolated and perfused rat liver. The liver is perfused with an albumin-free saline buffered solution supplemented with glucose, pyruvate and lactate, in the absence of oxygen, at a physiologically low flow rate. Fractions of the venous effluent are collected and analyzed for bilirubin, bilirubin glucuronide and biomarkers of liver integrity. The liver preparation is viable and intact for 1 h after isolation from the general circulation, with constant levels of both bilirubin and bilirubin glucuronide (&lt; 2 nM) in the effluent. Up to 12 boli of 10 nmol bilirubin can be sequentially injected into the portal vein without and with molecules that target sinusoidal membrane transporters of organic anions. Selective inhibition of bilirubin or bilirubin glucuronide uptake is detected as transient peaks in the effluent (C<sub>max</sub> up 6 to 60 nM). This protocol allows collecting repeated observations in the same liver, thus reducing the animal number by a factor of 10.</p><p><br></p>",
