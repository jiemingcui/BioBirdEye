            "content": "Some previous studies have shown that brain\u2013machine interfaces \\(BMIs) can induce plastic changes in cortical activity. A BMI works by first decoding neural activity of the mental action to move the affected hand, for example, and then by converting the decoded hand movement into that of a robotic neuroprosthesis. BMIs based on magnetoencephalography \\(MEG) sensorimotor cortex signals have been shown to be sufficient to precisely decode hand movements in real time, even in severely paralyzed patients simply intending to move the affected hands. Moreover, training to use BMIs induces plastic changes in cortical activity and, potentially, associated clinical symptoms. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHere, we will demonstrate how to apply the BMI of a neuroprosthetic \\(robotic) hand using real-time MEG signals to modulate the cortical activities and the pain in phantom limb patients. We evaluated the association between changes in their symptomatic pain and in cortical currents during phantom hand movements."

Take face scan and fiducial points \\(6 points in face and more than 50 points in head)\r\n  2.  Put EMG electrodes on face and both forearms \\(the signals for eye ball movements and blinks, ECG,  flexor digitorum superficialis and the extensor digitorum communis)\r\n  3. Put the patient into the MEG scanner \r\n  4. Start to record MEG signals\r\n  5. After taking 60 seconds of rest, the patients attempted to move their phantom hands at the presented times. \r\n  6. At first, the patients were visually instructed regarding the movement type to perform with the Japanese word for \u201cgrasp\u201d or \u201copen.\"\\(Figure 2)\nSee figure in Figures section.\n7. After 1 second, two sounds and one execution cue sound were given to the subjects as the timing to move their hands. The execution cues were repeated four times every 5.5s.\r\n  8. The procedure 6 and 7 were repeated for 10 times for each movement types.\r\n  9. Repeat 5 to 10 with moving their intact hands \\(grasping and opening)\r\n  10.

On the other hand, BMI training to control the prosthetic hand based on the real hand decoder, which was trained by the MEG signals during the patient moved their intact hands, will reduce pain with decreased information about phantom hand movements."
