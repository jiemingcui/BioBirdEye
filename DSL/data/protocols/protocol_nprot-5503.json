            "content": "1 Adapted from miRNeasy serum/plasma kit \u2013 added 5x volume of Qiazol.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2 PLG makes separation of the aqueous phase from the interface easier, and thus is particularly useful for large numbers of samples or less experienced personnel, but it is expensive.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3 If there is poor phase separation, the original biofluid can be diluted. To \u201crescue\u201d the exRNA preparation, additional buffer, Qiazol and chloroform can be added \\(maintaining the ratio 1:5:1).   \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4 The manufacturer\u2019s protocol is for 8000 x g, but some labs have found that 1000 x g for the binding step gives better results. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5 The centrifuge **must** be above 20\u00b0C so that excessive precipitation does not occur.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6 80% ethanol should be prepared with ethanol \\(96\u2013100%) and RNase-free water. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7 After centrifugation, carefully remove the RNeasy MinElute spin column from the collection tube so that the column does not contact the flow-through. Otherwise, carryover of ethanol will occur. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n8 To avoid damage to their lids, place the spin columns into the centrifuge with at least one empty position between columns. Orient the lids so that they point in a direction opposite to the rotation of the rotor \\(e.g., if the rotor rotates clockwise, orient the lids counterclockwise). It is important to dry the spin column membrane, since residual ethanol may interfere with downstream reactions. Centrifugation with the lids open ensures that no ethanol is carried over during RNA elution.    \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n9 This volume was selected to match that of other kits to enable fair comparisons. As little as 10 \u03bcL RNase-free water can be used for elution if a higher RNA concentration is required, but the yield will be reduced by approximately 20%. Do not elute with less than 10 \u03bcL RNase-free water, as the spin column membrane will not be sufficiently hydrated. The dead volume of the RNeasy MinElute spin column is 2 \u03bcL: elution with 14 \u03bcL RNase-free water results in a 12 \u03bcL eluate.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n10 Centrifuging at a low speed first helps the solvent wet the surface of the membrane prior to the full-speed centrifuging step. This results in a better yield/RNA recovery from the membrane."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "This protocol describes how to isolate total extracellular RNA from serum or plasma using the Qiagen miRNeasy Micro kit. It supercedes an earlier protocol \\(http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/protex.2015.115). The new protocol is based on our experience vetting the original protocol in multiple labs. The major change is an increase in input volume of biofluid from 200 \u00b5L to 500 \u00b5L. We found that the larger input volume led to more reproducible amounts of RNA isolation across multiple experiments.",
