            "content": "In vivo Magnetofection\u2122 is a rapid, simple and highly efficient method especially dedicated to transfect target cells/tissue in vivo. This original system combines magnetic nanoparticles and nucleic acid vectors that will be retained after injection at the magnetically targeted site. In this way, targeted delivery minimizes systemic distribution, decreases gene vectors inactivation and reduces toxicity. Furthermore, the magnetic forces enhance the uptake of magnetic nanoparticles by the target tissue, and thus improve the efficiency of transfection. This allows decreasing the required process time of delivery to few minutes which is crucial for improvement of in vivo nucleic acid delivery \\(principally in stringent conditions, refer to results for more information). All In vivo Magnetofection\u2122 reagents have been especially designed by our R&D team to meet in vivo grade quality \\(reagents performed under high manufacturing and quality standards and tested by strict quality controls).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn vivo Magnetofection has been developed for in vivo targeted transfection of various types of nucleic acids such as DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides \\(In vivo PolyMag / In vivo DogtorMag). DNA/nanoparticles can be easily administrated through various injection routes such as systemic administration \\(intravenous, intra-artery) or local administration \\(intraperitoneal, intratumoral, intracerebroventricular, intramuscular)."

            "header": "Troubleshooting",
            "content": "Problems Comments and Suggestions\r\n\n\nLow efficiency \r\n\n\n1- Nucleic acid amount. Use different quantity of DNA or siRNA with the recommended transfection reagent / nucleic acid ratio.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2- Magnetofection reagent / nucleic acid ratio. Optimize the reagent/nucleic acid ratio by varying the volume of reagent \\(In vivo PolyMag or Dogtor) from 0.5 \u00b5L to 2 \u00b5L per \u00b5g of DNA.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3- DNA quality. Nucleic acids should be as pure as possible, free of contaminants \\(proteins, phenol, ethanol...) and endotoxins free. It must be \u201ctransfection grade\u201d.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4- Expression cassette. Make sure that the transgene is well expressed in vivo, meaning that the expression cassette \\(promoter, terminator\u2026) is suited for in vivo.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5- Route of Injection. In order to improve your transfection, prefer a route of injection close to your target tissue; e.g. inject your vector intra-arterially into the tissue supplying artery \\(use the same quantity as intravenous administration, be careful, intra-arterial manipulations enhance the risk of thrombosis) or directly into the tissue of interest together with magnet application. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6- Medium used for preparing transfection complexes. Favour saline buffer \\(HBS, PBS, normal saline, Ringer\u2019s solution) or 5% glucose during the preparation of the complexes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7- Injection volume. Optimize the volume of injection to your application.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n8- Speed of injection. DNA expression could be dependent on the injection speed, adapt your speed of injection to your target tissue.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n9- Transfection reagent temperature. Reagents must be at room temperature and be vortexed prior to use.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n10- Old transfection reagent / DNA complexes. The transfection reagent / DNA complexes must be freshly prepared every time. Complexes prepared and stored for longer than 2 hours can be aggregated.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n11- Incubation time. Optimal time range between transfection and assay varies with tissue, promoter, expression product, etc. Transfection efficiency can be monitored after 4 \u2013 48h by analyzing the gene product.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nToxicity \r\n\n\n1- Concentration of transfection reagent / nucleic acid too high. Decrease the amount of nucleic acid / reagent complexes injected by lowering the nucleic acid amount or the transfection reagent concentration. Complexes aggregation can cause some toxicity; prepare them freshly and never inject complexes where precipitate has formed.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2- DNA quality - Presence of contaminants. Ensure that nucleic acid is pure, contaminant-free and endotoxin-free.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPrecipitate formation \r\n\n\n1- Concentration of transfection reagent / nucleic acid too high. Decrease the amount of nucleic acid / reagent complexes injected by lowering the nucleic acid amount or the transfection reagent concentration. Complexes aggregation can cause some toxicity; prepare them freshly and never inject complexes where precipitate has formed.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2- DNA quality - Presence of contaminants. Ensure that nucleic acid is pure, contaminant-free and endotoxin-free.  Prefer water than buffer \\(TE, Tris-Cl) for your DNA preparation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3- Injection solution. Prefer 5% glucose \\(final concentration) than saline buffer \\(HBS, PBS, normal saline, Ringer\u2019s solution).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOur dedicated and specialized technical support group will be pleased to answer any of your requests and to help you with your transfection experiments: tech@ozbiosciences.com.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "In vivo Magnetofection\u2122 is a rapid, simple and highly efficient method especially dedicated to transfect target cells/tissue in vivo. This original system combines magnetic nanoparticles and nucleic acid vectors that will be retained after injection at the magnetically targeted site. In this way, targeted delivery minimizes systemic distribution, decreases gene vectors inactivation and reduces toxicity. Furthermore, the magnetic forces enhance the uptake of magnetic nanoparticles by the target tissue, and thus improve the efficiency of transfection. This allows decreasing the required process time of delivery to few minutes which is crucial for improvement of in vivo nucleic acid delivery \\(principally in stringent conditions, refer to results for more information). All In vivo Magnetofection\u2122 reagents have been especially designed by our R&D team to meet in vivo grade quality \\(reagents performed under high manufacturing and quality standards and tested by strict quality controls).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn vivo Magnetofection has been developed for in vivo targeted transfection of various types of nucleic acids such as DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides \\(In vivo PolyMag / In vivo DogtorMag). DNA/nanoparticles can be easily administrated through various injection routes such as systemic administration \\(intravenous, intra-artery) or local administration \\(intraperitoneal, intratumoral, intracerebroventricular, intramuscular).",
