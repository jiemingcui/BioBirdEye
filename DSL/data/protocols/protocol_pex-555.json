            "content": "<p>Profiling epigenetic states largely relies on measurement of chromatin occupancy of covalently modified histones, histone regulators, and transcription factors (TFs)<sup>1-5</sup>. Among them, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the method of choice, allowing the rapid identification of transcriptional regulatory elements genome-wide<sup>6-9</sup>. Standard ChIP-seq requires a million or more cells. Reducing the required input to one to hundreds of cells would open up an array of new applications. For instance, understanding the transcriptional regulatory networks that control lineage specification in developing embryos would be enabled by using ChIP-seq to probe lineage-specific enhancers from low amounts of cells. To define differentiation trajectories and potentials of rare spatiotemporal progenitor cells, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) techniques have become widely used to separate subpopulations from transcriptomically heterogeneous cell populations<sup>10-13</sup>. However, a robust single-cell ChIP-seq tool remains lacking to understand epigenetic heterogeneity in complex tissue or cell populations at single cell level.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past decade, epigenomic studies have seen great strides towards reduced input sample size, including nano-ChIP<sup>14</sup>, UNI-NChIP<sup>15</sup>, STAR ChIP<sup>16</sup>, MOWChIP<sup>17</sup>, CUT&amp;RUN<sup>18</sup>and ChIL-seq<sup>19</sup>, but development of a generalizable, low-cost, and robust method effective on single cells or small cell populations lags behind. Microfluidic systems have been used to profile histone marks by ChIP-seq using as few as 100 cells<sup>17</sup>. A study by Rotem et al. demonstrated the proof-of-concept use of microfluidic systems for single-cell ChIP (Drop-ChIP). However, at ~800 reads per cell, the sparse data yield from Drop-ChIP limits its potential applications<sup>20</sup>.&nbsp;</p><p>Through overcoming these limitations, we present simultaneous indexing and tagmentation of opened/relaxed chromatin-based ChIP-seq (itChIP-seq)(Figure 1), which enables genome-wide profiling of histone modifications and non-histone proteins from ultra-low input (as few as 100 cells) and various histone modifications of single-cell samples (Figure 2), enabling processing rare cell populations of less than 100 single cells and abundant samples of thousands of single cells per assay. Furthermore, itChIP eliminates the requirement for specialized microfluidic devices and is generalizable and affordable for most biomedical research laboratories.&nbsp;</p>"

Optimization of the SDS concentration for chromatin opening. 10,000 ESCs after fixation for 7 min were treated with SDS as indicated concentrations at the step of chromatin opening at 62\u00b0C for 10 min, quenched with Triton X-100, tagmentated with Tn5 complex, and briefly sonicated to release chromatin followed by antibody based immunoprecipitation and DNA extraction by phenol-chloroform for both soluble and insoluable chromatin after reverse-crosslinking for size examination on agarose gel. We picked the condition yielding desired DNA fragments of < 1 kb (a), as those > 1 kb were undesired for sequencing, and higher ChIP-qPCR enrichment (b) for itChIP. 0.3% SDS was selected according to this criterion. P\u2009values were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test for multiple comparisons.\nc, d. Optimization of the required amount of Tn5 complex for efficient tagmentation. The same as in (a), except for the indicated Tn5 amount. We picked the condition yielding DNA fragments of < 1 kb (c) and higher ChIP-qPCR enrichment (d) for itChIP. 3 \u03bcl of 12.5 \u03bcM Tn5 transposase was selected for 10,000 cells according to this criterion. P\u2009values were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test for multiple comparisons.\ne, f. Optimization of the temperature for chromatin opening. The same as in (a), except for the indicated chromatin opening conditions, 37\u00b0C for 1 h and 62\u00b0C for 10 min. We picked the condition yielding DNA fragments of < 1 kb (e) and higher ChIP-qPCR enrichment (f) for itChIP. In this regard, 37\u00b0C for 1 h and 62\u00b0C for 10 min exhibited no difference. For simplicity, we used 62\u00b0C for 10 min to open chromatin in this study for all the itChIP experiments. P\u2009values were calculated by two-tailed paired t-test.\ng, h. Optimization of tagmentation conditions. The same as in (a), except for the indicated temperature and time for tagmentation. We picked the condition yielding DNA fragments of < 1 kb (g) and higher ChIP-qPCR enrichment (h) for itChIP. In this regard, both 37\u00b0C for 1 h and 55\u00b0C for 30 min can be used for chromatin tagmentation. For simplicity, we used 37\u00b0C for 1 h for chromatin tagmentation in this study for all the itChIP experiments. P\u2009values were calculated by two-tailed paired t-test.\nOptimal conditions were boxed. Dish lines in a, c, e, g indicate the position of 1 kb DNA marker.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Single-cell measurement of chromatin states, including histone modifications and non-histone protein binding, remains challenging. We present a low-cost, efficient ChIP-seq (simultaneous indexing and tagmentation-based ChIP-seq, itChIP), compatible to both low-input and single cells for profiling chromatin states. This single-cell itChIP approach combines chromatin opening, simultaneous cellular indexing and chromatin tagmentation in a single tube, processing samples with tens of single cells in rarity or with thousands of single cells per assay, and the entire procedure can be finished in two days. The sc-itChIP data acquire ~9,000 unique reads per cell, sufficiently capturing the earliest epigenetic priming along cell fate transition and the basis for cell-type specific enhancer usage. Our results demonstrate that itChIP is a generalizable technology for single-cell chromatin profiling of epigenetically heterogeneous cell populations in many biological processes. This step-by-step protocol is related to the publication \u201cProfiling chromatin state by single-cell itChIP-seq\u201d in Nature Cell Biology.</p>",
