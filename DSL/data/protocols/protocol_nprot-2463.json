            "content": "The common approach to bioimaging, detection, and diagnosis with nanoparticles is to make use of the specificity and avidity of monoclonal antibodies \\(mAbs) for targeting \\(**Fig. 1a,b**)<sup>1,2</sup>. Although several mAb\u2013nanoparticle conjugates have been used for biomarker labeling, these functionalized nanoprobes are large, which limits the number of ligands that can be linked to the surface of a nanoparticle, impedes intratumoral distribution of nanoprobes because of interstitial tumor pressure, and limits their intracellular and intratissular penetration<sup>3</sup>. Immunoglobulins G \\(IgGs) have a molecular weight of 150 kDa and an average size of 14.5\u00d78.5\u00d74 nm, which considerably limits their use for targeting<sup>4</sup>. Furthermore, the conditions of mAb conjugation using conventional techniques provide the nanoprobes with irregular orientation of mAbs on the nanoparticle surface and often provoke IgG unfolding \\(**Fig. 1c**)<sup>5</sup>.  Smaller antibody fragments conjugated with the nanoparticles in a highly oriented manner may become an attractive alternative as components of the smallest possible targeted nanoprobes.\r\n\n\nIgGs are composed of two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains \\(**Fig. 1b**). A light chain contains one variable domain \\(VL) and one constant domain \\(CL), and a heavy chain has one variable domain \\(VH) and three constant domains \\(CHs). The antigen-binding sites of IgG are formed by association of the variable domains, VL\u2013VH. Three interchain disulfide bonds ensure the stability and functional activity of IgG \\(**Fig. 1a,b**). As free sulfhydryls of Ab may be useful in a conjugation reaction with nanoparticle, the disulfide bond in the hinge region of IgG should be selectively reduced to obtain a functionally active partially cleaved heavy\u2013light chain Ab fragment \\(75 kDa, **Fig. 1c**).\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2250/original/Figure_1_page_1.jpg?1345046869\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n**Figure 1.** Schematic diagram of the structures of full-size antibodies \\(Abs), their fragments, and different approaches to their linkage to nanoparticles.\r\n\n\n\\(**a**) The Y-shaped structure of a full-size Ab, which is the ligand to be attached to the nanoparticle; the two light chains \\(variable regions) and the heavy chains \\(constant regions) are shown in violet and red, respectively. The specific functional sites at which the Ab can bind antigens are shown in green. The groups that can be used for attachment to nanoparticles are shown in yellow. \r\n\n\n\\(**b**) A three-dimensional model of an Ab based on X-ray crystallography data. The Ab structure was taken from entry 1IGY of the Protein Data Bank \\(PDB). Light chains are shown in orange and cyan; heavy chains, in yellow and green. Carbohydrate residues are shown in purple. \r\n\n\n\\(**c**) Fragmentation of an Ab into functional and nonfunctional Ab fragments after reduction of their disulfide bonds. \r\n\n\n\\(**d**) Fragmentation of a llama heavy-chain Ab \\(HcAb) resulting in single variable-domain Ab fragments \\(single-domain antibodies, sdAbs).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Previous techniques and alternative methods**\r\n\n\nIn terms of increasing the number of functionally active Abs on the nanoparticle surface, the integrity of the Ab binding sites and proper orientation of Abs after conjugation are the two crucial conditions. Commercial Ab\u2013nanoparticle probes, e.g., Ab\u2013quantum dot \\(QD) nanoprobes are made by conjugation of fragments of completely reduced Abs with amino groups on the surface of QDs \\(**Fig. 1c**)<sup>5,6</sup>.  Complete reduction of Abs disrupts the integrity of the recognition sites, each of which is formed by the variable domains of a heavy and a light chain linked by disulfide bonds, because these are also reduced . Other known strategies for Ab covalent coupling to QDs require a passivating ligand bound to the quantum surface to make it possible to use carbodiimide \\(\u2013COOH), NHS ester \\(\u2013NH<sub>2</sub>), or maleimide \\(\u2013SH) chemistry routes<sup>8,9</sup>. These approaches are not specific for the conjugation site, and they yield nanoprobes with irregular orientation of Abs on the nanoparticle surface \\(**Fig. 2a**).\r\n\n\nRecently, we have developed an advanced conjugation procedure based on selective reduction of the disulfide bond in the hinge region of IgG, leaving the bonds between the heavy and light chains intact \\(**Fig.1c**)<sup>7</sup>. This ensures a high yield of functionally active half-antibodies, which can be purified and covalently conjugated with QDs by sulfo-SMCC chemistry methods to obtain nanoprobes with intact recognition sites and homogeneous orientations of Abs relative to the QD surface. These probes, though rather large in size, exhibit a tenfold higher recognition capacity compared to conventional nanoprobes<sup>7</sup>. Despite this improvement, the approach developed does not always guarantee uniform orientation of the Ab functional fragments on the QD surface; therefore, new approaches to directional conjugation are required.\r\n\n\nOne strategy to overcome the aforementioned problems is to engineer very small but functional Ab fragments, modify them so that only one, unique site per fragment is accessible for conjugation with the carrier \\(e.g., a nanoparticle), and deliver many such fragments on a single carrier \\(**Fig. 2b**). It is even possible to obtain multivalent nanoprobes, where small, functionally active fragments of different Abs against different antigens may be bound to the same nanoparticle in the same orientation<sup>10</sup>. In this way, more than one cellular target can be identified with a single multivalent probe<sup>11</sup>.\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2251/original/Figure_2.jpg?1345113947\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n**Figure 2.** Conjugates of \\(**a**) full-size and \\(**b**) single-domain antibodies with quantum dots.\r\n\n\n\\(**a**) Quantum dots \\(QDs) are conjugated with full-size antibodies \\(Abs) using carbodiimide chemistry. Abs are oriented randomly relative to the nanoparticle surface; some antigen-binding domains \\(red ovals) are sterically inaccessible \\(blue arrows). Only domains exposed to the outside are functionally active \\(orange arrows). \r\n\n\n\\(**b**) QDs are conjugated with single-domain Abs \\(sdAbs) via a single Cys residue specifically integrated in the sdAb C terminus. The antigen-binding domain of every sdAb is exposed to the outside and remains functionally active. \r\n\n\n_The anatomy of QDs_: Se, orange; Cd, violet; S, yellow; Zn, dark-blue; C, light-blue; O, red; H, white.\r\n\n\n_The anatomy of Abs_: \u03b2-structures, green bands; \u03b1-helix, red cylinders.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n**Objectives of this technique**\r\n\n\nWith a molecular weight of only 13 kDa, single-domain antibodies \\(sdAbs or VhH, **Fig. 1d**) represent the smallest functional Ab fragments capable of binding antigens with affinities comparable to those of conventional antibodies<sup>12</sup>. An sdAb molecule occupies 12 times less space than a conventional IgG antibody does, and its size allows it to bind epitopes inaccessible to conventional IgGs<sup>13</sup>. In addition to their small size, sdAbs are not prone to aggregation; they exist as monomers, diffuse much better into tissues than full-size IgGs<sup>14</sup>, and their size allows them to label finer and more remote segments of organs and bind with the corresponding antigens more accurately compared to conventional IgGs<sup>15,16</sup>. sdAbs are resistant to chemical detergents, extreme pH levels, heat, and proteolytic enzymes ,  and can be produced inexpensively using _Escherichia coli_ or yeast cultures. All these characteristics make sdAbs the best capture molecules to prepare QD-based fluorescent nanoprobes for biodetection and diagnosis. Zaman _et al._<sup>19,20</sup>  recently used carbodiimide chemistry to conjugate anti-EGFR sdAbs to QDs. However, this approach provides nanoprobes with irregular orientation of sdAbs on the nanoparticle surface; hence, the resultant conjugates are not more efficient than conventional mAb\u2013QD conjugates. To fully use the advantages of these unique ultrasmall capture molecules, they should be coupled with nanoparticles in a highly oriented manner \\(**Fig. 2b**).\r\n\n\nHere, we describe a well-tested protocol for engineering a new generation of ultrasmall, stable, specific diagnostic nanoprobes based on sdAbs \\(**Fig. 1d**) linked to QDs in a highly oriented manner \\(**Fig. 2b**)<sup>15,16</sup>. We present a method for preparing diagnostic nanoparticles <12 nm in diameter \\(ten times smaller in volume than that obtainable with alternative techniques) and demonstrate their high efficiency in flow cytometry and immunohistochemical diagnostic platforms. The protocol is so designed that it can be easily extended to other types of semiconductor or noble metal plasmonic or magnetic nanoparticles of different shapes, such as nanodots, nanorods, and nanowires. sdAbs containing a single Cys residue for conjugation with these nanoparticles can be engineered in about the same way. In this case, the concentrations of functionalized sdAbs and nanoparticles in the conjugation reaction should be optimized depending on the nanoparticle size, shape, and concentration.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Experimental design**\r\n\n\nThe protocol described here consists of\r\n\n\n\\(i) colloidal nanocrystal synthesis, characterization, quality control, and standardization;\r\n\n\n\\(ii) nanocrystal water-solubilization, purification, functionalization, and quality control;\r\n\n\n\\(iii)  llama immunization and construction of a sdAb library followed by selection and ELISA screening of phage\u2013sdAbs;\r\n\n\n\\(iv)  sdAb cloning, specific Cys-residue integration, sdAb production and purification, and affinity measurements;\r\n\n\n\\(v) conjugation of sdAb\u2013Cys antibodies with hydroxy- or amino-modified colloidal nanocrystals followed by characterization and quality control of the resultant diagnostic nanoprobes.\r\n\n\nThe efficiency of this protocol was proved by the use of the engineered diagnostic nanoprobes in flow cytometry detection of cells expressing a rare biomarker and detection of immunohistochemistry biomarkers in clinical biopsies, where the probes have ensured clear discrimination between pathological and healthy areas<sup>15,16</sup>. The sdAb\u2013QD conjugates stain all antigenic sites revealed by \"gold standard\" anatomopathological diagnostic methods, whereas the conventional fluorescence-based medical diagnostic protocol leaves many antigenic sites undetected \\(see ANTICIPATED RESULTS)."

Make serial dilutions of the phage suspension to a final dilution of 10\n\u201312\nfor the input suspension and 10\n\u20138\nfor the output one. Inoculate the suspensions with 500 \u00b5l of TG1 at OD\n600\n= 0.5. Incubate without shaking at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Plate 100 \u00b5l of each dilution of the bacteria suspension onto 2\u00d7 TYAG agar plates \\(9-cm Petri dishes). Grow overnight at 37\u00b0C. Count the colonies and calculate the CFU or CFU/ml titer according to the dilution.\r\n\n\n**\u25b2CRITICAL STEP** Monitor properly the OD of the TG1 culture.

            "content": "We have recently used ultrasmall diagnostic nanoprobes engineered by our method in the flow cytometry and immunohistochemical cancer diagnostic platforms<sup>15,16</sup>. In order to prove the concept, we used carcinoembryonic antigen \\(CEA), a well-known cancer biomarker, as a target<sup>21</sup>. An elevated concentration of CEA can be detected in the blood of patients with some cancers, especially large intestine \\(colorectal) cancer. It may also be detected in patients with pancreas, breast, ovary, or lung cancer. CEA is normally produced during embryonic development<sup>21</sup>. The production of CEA stops before birth, and the antigen is not normally found in the blood of healthy adults. The CEA test is used to find how widespread some cancers, especially colorectal cancer, are and to test the success of their treatment. The CEA levels before and after surgery can be measured to evaluate both the success of the surgery, the patient's chances of recovery, and the efficiency of therapy, as well as to detect recurrence of the disease<sup>21</sup>. As a membrane antigen overexpressed by cancer cells, CEA can be targeted for imaging or therapeutic purposes.\r\n\n\nWe have shown that sdAb\u2013QD conjugates are stable, retain target specificity to CEA-expressing tumor cells in human serum, and may be used for detection of CEA-expressing tumor cells by means of flow cytometry assay. Moreover, the data show excellent correlation between the number of cells detected as CEA-positive and the actual number of CEA-positive cells in mixtures of CEA-positive and CEA-negative MC38 cells, where as few as 1% of CEA-positive cells can be easily detected \\(**Fig. 8**). This confirms the high specificity of flow cytometry detection using sdAb\u2013QD conjugates.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2258/original/Figure_8.jpg?1345113956\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n**Figure 8.** Discrimination of CEA-positive \\(MC38CEA) and CEA-negative \\(MC38) cells in their mixture using sdAb\u2013QD conjugates.\r\n\n\n\\(**a**) Distribution of the intensity of staining with sdAb\u2013QD conjugates in a mixture of MC38CEA and MC38 cells. The MF intensity of MC38 cells \\(M1) is 5.7; the MF intensity of MC38CEA cells \\(M2) is 95.7 \\(red, 100% of MC38; pink, 90% of MC38 + 10% of MC38CEA; blue, 75% of MC38 + 25% of MC38CEA; green, 100% of MC38CEA). \r\n\n\n\\(**b**) The calibration curve for quantitative detection of MC38CEA cells in mixtures of MC38CEA and MC38 cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFinally, immunolabeling of human biopsies with the use of sdAb\u2013QD conjugates is as efficient as that provided by the \"gold standard\" DAB-based protocol or, in some respects, more efficient than it and ensures clear discrimination between tumor and non-pathological tissue areas. The sdAb\u2013QD fluorescent detection has also been favorably compared with the standard fluorescence detection procedure, where biopsies are stained with anti-CEA mAbs revealed using polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG\u2013FITC conjugates. In addition, sdAb\u2013QD conjugates have been shown to stain all antigenic sites revealed with the \"gold standard\" anatomopathological diagnosis, whereas the conventional fluorescence-based medical diagnostic protocol leaves many antigenic sites undetected \\(**Fig. 9**).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOur protocol has been so designed that it can be easily extended to other types of plasmonic and semiconductor nanoparticles.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2259/original/Figure_9.jpg?1345113957\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n**Figure 9.** Comparative histochemical immunostaining of a patient's appendix epithelial crypts using the sdAb\u2013QD and conventional techniques.\r\n\n\n\\(**a**) CEA \\(brown) revealed with the use of anti-CEA IgG and DAB chromogen \\(light microscopy).\r\n\n\n\\(**b**) CEA \\(yellow) revealed with the use of anti-CEA sdAb covalently linked to QD570 \\(epi-fluorescence microscopy). \r\n\n\n\\(**c**) CEA \\(green) revealed with the use of mouse anti-CEA IgG and anti-mouse IgG\u2013FITC \\(epi-fluorescence microscopy)."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Nanoparticle-based biodetection commonly employs monoclonal antibodies \\(mAbs) for targeting. Although several types of conjugates have been used for biomarker labeling, the large size of mAbs limits the number of ligands per nanoparticle, impedes their intratumoral distribution, and limits intracellular penetration. Furthermore, the conditions of mAb conjugation using conventional techniques provide nanoprobes with irregular orientation of mAbs on the nanoparticle surface and often provoke mAb unfolding. Here, we have developed a protocol to engineer ultrasmall diagnostic nanoprobes through directional conjugation of semiconductor quantum dots \\(QDs) with 13-kDa single-domain antibodies \\(sdAbs) derived from llama immunoglobulin G \\(IgG). sdAbs are conjugated with QDs in a highly oriented manner via an additional cysteine residue specifically integrated into the sdAb C-terminus. The resultant nanoprobes are <12 nm in diameter, ten times smaller in volume compared to the known alternatives. They have been proved highly efficient in flow cytometry and immunuhistochemical diagnosis. This approach is easy to extend to other semiconductor and plasmonic nanoparticles. In general, sdAb-QD bioconjugation, quality control and characterization take 3 days.",
