            "content": "<p>The majority of plants are vulnerable to water deficit, losing viability upon water loss of 40-70% of total water content [1]. There is a small group of plant species able to survive extreme dehydration \u2013 after long periods of almost full desiccation (~10% relative water content) they can recover fully and quickly when water is available again [2]. These plants, known as resurrection plants are very useful model system for studying plant response to desiccation stress [3].</p><p>In resurrection plants, water loss of leaf tissues results in considerable physiological and metabolic changes at cellular and molecular level, including accumulation of various osmoprotectants and activation of strong antioxidant systems. Their orchestrated actions are directed at maintaining the macromolecular stability and prevention of damage [4,5]. All these processes require active role of water \u2013 as a driving force for the formation of biological membranes and conformational changes of proteins [4].</p><p>All the cellular events could be related to the physical state of the cell-associated water [6\u20139]. Therefore, measurement and characterization<em> in vivo </em>of water molecular structure and dynamics would provide useful information and new insights into the mechanism of desiccation tolerance.</p><p>A novel approach \u2013 aquaphotomics [7], based on near infrared spectroscopy provides a non-destructive mode of measurement of water structure and dynamics in the plant tissues <em>in vivo</em>. Aquaphotomics is a dynamic spectroscopy focused on in-depth exploration of water, its structure and roles in biological systems [7,10]. Despite being focused on measurement and characterization of water structure and dynamics, aquaphotomics provides indirect characterization of the biological system as a whole, where all biomolecular events are mirrored by subtle changes in the water matrix [7,10]. This so-called \u201cwater-mirror approach\u201d utilizes extremely high sensitivity of water\u2019s hydrogen bonds which readily adapt to any change and produce differences in the spectra that can be measured, analyzed and interpreted from the aspect of the system functionality.&nbsp;</p><p>Application field of aquaphotomics is very wide and ranges from fundamental studies of water solutions to complex diagnostics in veterinary and human medicine[11]. The protocol provided here is developed specifically for monitoring the desiccation and rehydration process in order to study the mechanism of desiccation tolerance. With small adaptations, regarding specific plant material and/or experimental conditions, the protocol allows investigation of plants\u2019 responses to various forms of biotic and abiotic stresses [12,13].&nbsp;</p>"

For every time point [16], remove three plantlets from the culture vessels and leave them to dry in the open air in a culture room under controlled conditions. For\nH. rhodopensis\nit takes 24h to reach full dry state (further drying does not reduce the water content below ~10%). Perform dehydration of\nD. eberhardtii\nplantlets in the same way for every time point [16]. Air drying takes place 168h when water content of the non-resurrection plant species reaches ~10%.\nBefore rehydration store the fully desiccated\nH. rhodopensis\nfor 10 days under controlled conditions as described above. Perform rehydration by putting the dried plantlets on moist cotton beds for 24 hours.\nRecovery of\nD. eberhardtii\nis only possible for plantlets desiccated till 48h time point (the relative water content of the leaves reaches about 35% - \u201cpoint of no return\u201d) [15,16]. Thus, rehydration performed as above can be done with such\nD. eberhardtii\nsamples only.\nMore information on dehydration-rehydration procedure is available in previous publications [15,16].\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aquaphotomics near infrared spectroscopy\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spectral acquisition process\nBefore the spectral acquisition prepare the plant material by separating the leaves with a surgical knife.\nPut the leaves on the gold reflector cell (Figure 1) and perform the spectral acquisition in transflectance mode.\nUsing the operating software for spectral data acquisition (WinISI II, version 1.50, Infrasoft International LLC.), set the following parameters of acquisition: spectral range 1100-2500nm, resolution step 2nm, each spectrum average of 32 scans.\nFor each plant measure three spectra of different leaves.\nPerform spectral acquisition as described for the following time points - at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 24 hours after starting desiccation for\nH. rhodopensis\nand 0, 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168 hours after beginning desiccation for\nD. eberhardtii\n. In the subsequent rehydration process,\u00a0acquire spectra at 1, 2, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours after starting rehydration for\nH. rhodopensis\nand 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours after undertaking rehydration for\nD. eberhardtii.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Data analysis\nPerform extended multiplicative scatter correction (EMSC)[17] to eliminate scattering effects arising from different thickness and surface properties of leaves. All subsequent analysis perform on EMSC transformed spectral data.\nCalculate difference spectra by subtracting the averaged spectrum of each plant\u2019s fresh leaves from the corresponding averaged spectra of leaves at various time points of dehydration and rehydration.\nPerform Principal component analysis (PCA)[18] with leave one sample out cross validation as an exploratory analysis of spectral variation during desiccation and rehydration processes.\nCalculate second derivative spectra using Norris gap second derivative [19] (gap size=3) on EMSC treated spectra to reveal the presence of hidden and overlapped peaks of the water species.\nBased on the peaks discovered in the previous step calculate ratios of water species absorbing at thus found water absorbance bands (S\nr\n, S\n0\n, S\n1\n, S\n2\n, S\n3\nand S\n4\n)[16].\u00a0Calculate the relative absorbance of these water species for each time point during dehydration/rehydration cycle as follows:\nArel,s=As/sum(Asi),\nwhere:\n- Arel,s - is the relative absorbance of particular water species S (that is, one of the S\nr\n, S\n0\n, S\n1\n, S\n2\n, S\n3\nand S\n4\n) expressed in percentages,\n- As - is the mean value of the absorbance for this particular water species found as an arithmetic mean of absorbance for all plant leaves at the wavelength where this water species absorb (Figure 2)\n- sum(Asi) is the sum of mean absorbances for all the water species Si at that time point.\nThus calculated relative absorbances plot together on a stacked column chart where each column corresponds to a certain time point during dehydration and rehydration of\nH. rhodopensis\nand\nD. eberhardtii."

Principal component analysis provided information that the changes in water molecular structure of the leaves in the resurrection plants are reversible, which is a conclusion based on the same shape and almost same percentage of explained variance by the loading vector of the first principal component. The second derivative transformed spectra revealed 6 water absorbance bands where highest variation during desiccation-rehydration cycle occurred in the resurrection plants. Comparison of relative absorbance of specific six water species revealed different dynamics of water structural reorganization in resurrection plant and non-resurrection plant i.e. \u2013 in non-resurrection plant water dynamics showed random fluctuations during desiccation and in the finally dried state high percentage of free water molecules, while resurrection plants showed orchestrated reorganization aimed at drastic decrease of free water molecules and massive increase of water molecular dimers and water molecules with 4 hydrogen bonds. </p><p>The results obtained using this protocol showed marked differences in the plant response to desiccation stress and are illustrated in Figures 3-8. The aquaphotomics based near infrared spectroscopy is found to be informationally rich and provided novel insights into the mechanism of desiccation tolerance. The measurement method in principle allows non-destructive, <em>in vivo</em> measurements and non-invasive monitoring of plants\u2019 response to stress. Hence, it is a novel, cost-effective, rapid measurement mode for detection, monitoring and studying plant response to stress in general (biotic or abiotic).&nbsp;</p>"

They leave imprint on the molecular structure of water in the plant tissues which can be measured <em>in vivo</em>, in a completely non-destructive and reagent-free way, using aquaphotomics near infrared spectroscopy. Analysis of the near infrared spectrum regions, where water absorbs, provides indirect insight into the dynamics and functionality of the whole biological system.</p><p>In our efforts to perform Responsible Research and Innovations (RRI) practices, we display openly the details of our approach showing the advantages and the eventual difficulties. The protocol described here is developed for non-destructive monitoring of plant response to desiccation stress, particularly focused on the extreme desiccation tolerance of resurrection plants. With alterations in plant material and experimental conditions, the methods described allow detection, monitoring and analysis of plant response to stress in general - abiotic and biotic.</p>",
