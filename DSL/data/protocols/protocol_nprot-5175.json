            "content": "In mammals, three types of adipocytes coexist, i.e brown, beige and white adipocytes, which are all involved in energy balance regulation while having opposite functions. White adipose tissue \\(WAT) is dispersed throughout the body and is mainly involved in energy storage and mobilization in form of triglycerides. In contrast, brown adipose tissue \\(BAP) is specialized in energy expenditure. Brite, also named beige, adipocytes were recently described as brown-like adipocytes and represent a third type of adipocytes recruited in WAT<sup>1</sup>. BAT implants were recently shown to improve the metabolic conditions in obese mice and restore normoglycemia in diabetic mice<sup>2, 3</sup>. These recent findings offer promising prospects to counteract obesity by activating BAT or transplanting brown, beige adipocyte progenitors \\(APs) in obese patients. However, BAT represents a minor fraction of adipose tissue in humans and disappears from most areas with age, persisting only around deeper organs<sup>4</sup>.  Human BAT is hard to isolate in this regard, so an alternative cellular source is required to generate brown adipocytes. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cells \\(hiPSCs) can be differentiated into multiple cell types in vitro. Following the pioneer work of Yamanaka\u2019s group on the generation of patent \u2013specific hiPSC by reprogramming somatic cells<sup>5</sup>, hiPSCs emerged as an unlimited source of autologous BAPs for cell-based therapy of obesity. Indeed, several studies indicated that hiPSCs could potentially be used to generate brown adipocytes with therapeutics properties.  Nakao\u2019s group was the first to demonstrate the capacity of hiPSC to generate functional adipocytes<sup>6</sup>. Nishio et al.<sup>7</sup> developed a procedure to generate functional brown adipocytes at a high frequency using an hematopoietic cocktail to induce hiPSC differentiation.  Interestingly, hiPSC-brown adipocytes were able to improve glucose tolerance after transplantation in mice.  However, numerous issues have to be investigated before a therapeutic use of hiPSC-BAPs, notably their purification and differentiation into functional adipocytes. Indeed, in both works, total differentiated hiPSC cell populations, but not purified APs, were transplanted into mice. Differentiated hiPSC cultures can be enriched with adipocytes, but also contain other cell types that are unsuitable for transplantation, including undifferentiated hiPSC that can for teratomas.  As well, Ahfeldt et al.<sup>8</sup> were able to generate pure brown APs from hiPSCs that displayed a high adipogenic capacity but only following transduction with adipogenic master genes. The need to genetically modify hiPSC-APs clearly illustrates the low adipogenic potential of hiPSC-derived APs and hampers their clinical use. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe recently reported the potential of hiPSCs to generate both brown and white Aps<sup>9</sup>. However, a bottleneck is the weak adipogenic potential of hiPSC-derived APs compared to adult adipose tissue-derived APs<sup>10</sup>. This feature has be observed by us and others using different approaches to derive mesenchymal stem cells from hESC and hiPSC. Therefore the differentiation of hiPSC-BAPs requires a protocol different than those used to differentiate APs derived from adult tissues. We describe a protocol to derive BAPs from hiPSC and to differentiate them at a high efficiency without genetic modification. A schematic diagram of the timing for derivation and differentiation of hiPSC-BAPs is shown in Figure 1."

As a guideline, seed hiPSCs from one well of 6-well-tissue-culture-grade plates onto one well of 6-well-ultra-low attachment plates in hiPSC growth medium without FGF2.  This is taken as the day 0 of differentiation. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**TIP**:  Do not move the plate for 3 days in the incubator. This will improve the formation of EBs.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Change the hiPSC growth medium without FGF2 at day 3 and then change the medium daily to day 10. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**TIP**: To change the medium, collect the medium containing EBs in a 15 ml conical tube. Leave the tube 15 minutes under the hood for allowing EBs to sediment at the bottom of the tube by gravity. A short spin of the tubes at a low speed \\(10 sec at 800g) may increase the number of EBs collected. Remove gently the supernatant, add fresh medium and seed EBs back on the 6-well-ultra-low attachment plates. It is important to not dissociate EBs formed by using un-appropriate pipettes. We recommend the use of 3 ml sterile Pasteur pipettes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. At Day 10, plate EBs from one well of 6-well-ultra-low-attachment plate onto one gelatin-coated well of 6-well-plate-tissue-grade-culture in hiPSC growth medium. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**TIP**: Do not move the plate for 3 days to improve adhesion of EBs on the bottom of the well. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5.

Repeat step 8, usually 3-4 times, until achieving a cell population with a homogenous CD73 labelling determined by FACS analysis. Then, BAPs must be characterized in more details as CD105+/CD90+/CD140a+/CD31-/CD45- by FACS analysis and by expression of _PAX3_, _DIO2_ and absence of expression of _HOXC8_, _HOXC9_, _HOXA5_ by real time PCR. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Note**: At that stage adipose progenitors can be amplified and cryopreserved using conventional methods \\(as an example, see reference \\[11]. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Differentiation of hiPSC-brown adipose progenitor_ \r\n\n\n1.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells \\(hiPSC) show great promise for obesity treatment as they represent an unlimited source of brown/brite adipose progenitors \\(BAPs). However, BAPs derived from hiPSCs \\(hiPSC-BAPs) display a low adipogenic capacity compared to adult-BAPs when maintained in a traditional adipogenic cocktail. The reasons of this features are unknown and hamper their use both in cell based therapy and basic research. We describe the steps in details to derive BAPs from hiPSCs and to differentiate hiPSC-BAPs at a high rate into mature brown adipocytes. hiPSC-BAPs can be subcultured to produce large amount of brown/brite adipocytes and cryopreserved. This model offers a platform for the identification of pathways governing the earliest steps of human adipocyte development as well as an abundant source of cells for cell therapy approaches.",
