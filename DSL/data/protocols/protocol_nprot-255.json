            "content": "_Helicobacter pylori_ \\(_H. pylori_), a spiral-shaped Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human gastric mucosa, is estimated to inhabit at least half of the world's human population, causes active chronic gastric inflammation<sup>1,2</sup>, and has been defined as a class one carcinogen<sup>3</sup>. So far, various _in vivo H. pylori_ infection models including mice, Mongolian gerbils, piglets, dogs, and monkeys have been developed to define the association between _H. pylori_ infection and gastrointestinal diseases<sup>4</sup>. Among them the Mongolian gerbil is an appropriate animal model of long-term _H. pylori_ infection in which various gastrointestinal diseases including gastric cancer can be studied<sup>5</sup>. _In vitro, H. pylori_ -infection models have been established using cultured gastric epithelial cells, such as AGS, and subjected to the investigation of intracellular signaling cascades triggered by _H. pylori_ infection<sup>6</sup>.\r\n\n\n_H. pylori_ can be subclassified into _cag_ pathogenicity island \\(_cag_ PAI) -positive and _cag_ PAI-negative strains based on the presence or absence of the _cag_ PAI, a 40-kb genome fragment containing 31 genes<sup>7</sup>. The _cag_ PAI encodes type IV secretion system proteins, which export bacterial macromolecules from bacterial cells into host cells<sup>1,8</sup>. Only strains containing the _cag_ PAI trigger various changes in signaling cascades in gastric epithelial cells, and disturb cellular functions, resulting in multiple alterations in gene expression profiles. Thus, the _cag_ PAI-positive isolates have been shown to be more virulent strains that produce severe pathologic infection in humans than the _cag_ PAI-negative isolates. Indeed several clinical studies have provided evidence linking _cag_ PAI-positive strains to the increased risk of human gastric cancer, compared with _cag_ PAI-negative strains<sup>9-12</sup>. _In vitro_, infection with _cag_ PAI-positive strains in AGS human gastric epithelial cells causes characteristic changes in the cellular phenotype called the &#x201C;hummingbird&#x201D; phenotype, characterized by the elongation and spreading of cells<sup>13</sup>. These changes are induced by bacterial macromolecules via the type IV secretion system encoded by the _cag_ PAI. Since infection with _cag_ PAI-positive _H. pylori_ is usually confirmed by the appearance of the hummingbird phenotypical changes _in vitro_, infection efficacy can be determined by the prevalence of the &#x201C;hummingbird&#x201D; morphological change.\r\n\n\n_H. pylori_ is a genomically diverse pathogen and several bacterial virulence factors, including the _cag_ PAI, VacA, BabA2, etc., are considered to play key roles in disease pathogenesis. The _cag_ PAI genes are divided into two major groups, a Western group and a Japanese group, in accordance with the entire _cag_ PAI sequences<sup>14</sup>. It is important to note that the resultant changes in epithelial cellular functions after _H. pylori_ infection may vary according to the types of the _H. pylori_ strains used. Thus the selection of bacterial strain could be one of the key factors for _H. pylori_ studies. In our recent study, we used a Japanese type of _cag_ PAI-positive _H. pylori_, TN2GF4, which has been shown to cause severe active chronic gastritis, ulcers, intestinal metaplasia, and gastric adenocarcinoma in infected Mongolian gerbils<sup>5</sup>, and therefore is supposed to be one of the most virulent strains of _cag_ PAI-positive _H. pylori_.\r\n\n\nIn our recent study, we demonstrated that _cag_ PAI-positive _H. pylori_ infection induced proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-&#x3BA;B \\(NF-&#x3BA;B) activation, leading to the aberrant expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase \\(AID)<sup>15</sup>, a member of the cytidine-deaminase family that acts as a DNA/RNA-editing enzyme. AID is an essential enzyme for somatic hypermutation, class switch recombination, and gene conversion, which physiologically occurs in immunoglobulin genes in B cells<sup>16</sup>. Recent studies, however, demonstrated that inappropriate expression of AID acts as a genomic mutator that contributes to tumorigenesis<sup>17-19</sup>, and moreover we provided the first evidence that aberrant AID expression caused by _H. pylori_ infection might be a mechanism of mutational accumulation in the gastric mucosa during _H. pylori_ -associated gastric carcinogenesis<sup>15</sup>.\r\n\n\nHere we describe the experimental procedure used to determine how _cag_ PAI-positive _H. pylori_ infection achieves the induction of endogenous AID expression in cultured gastric epithelial cells. We include detailed protocols for the growth and maintenance of _H. pylori_ culture<sup>20,21</sup>, epithelial cell cultures, co-culture assays, the polymerase chain reaction \\(PCR), immunoblot analysis, and immunostaining procedures."

Turn the plate 90\no\nand repeat.\r\n\n\n3| Place covered plates in a GasPack jar with upside-down.\r\n\n\n4| Add water to CampyPack Plus \\(BBL) envelope according to manufacturers instructions and then quickly place in a GasPack jar.\r\n\n\n5| Seal the top of the jar well and place at 37\no\nC for 2-4 days.\r\n\n\n6| Harvest viable _H. pylori_ from plates. Place 1 ml of sterile broth in the center of plate of _H. pylori_ with 2-3 days growth on it. Lift bacteria from plate by continuous scraping with a sterile glass bacterial spreader, making sure the entire surface is done. Tip plate at a shallow angle and gently work all the liquid to the lower edge of the plate. Remove with a 1 ml pipetman and place in a sterile tube. Place a 10 \u03bcl aliquot on a microscope slide and examine 400X to determine viability and to insure there is no contamination.\r\n\n\n7| Prepare by inoculating 50 ml of complete media in a sterile tissue culture flask with 1/8 plates worth of Bacteria \\(125 \u03bcl).
