            "content": "<p>\tIn recent years, a variety of human cells and tissues have been created from human-derived embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), and efforts are underway to utilize them in regenerative medicine. Trilineage differentiation tests of these stem cells and safety tests of human cells induced to differentiate from these cells are conducted in immunocompromised mice. However, the efficacy of the human-derived regenerative medical products thus obtained should ideally be investigated by preclinical tests in large animals such as pigs.</p><p>\tFrom this perspective, attempts have been made worldwide to create pigs with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID pigs). However, these animals can only be reared in an extremely strictly controlled environment <sup>1,2</sup>. For the same reason, numerous experiments have been carried out in which human-derived cells have been transplanted into pigs and maintained by means of immunosuppressant administration, but there are concerns that pigs of different ages and breeds may respond differently <sup>3</sup>, and a stable, adjustable immunosuppression protocol that can be widely used has yet to be developed. We have surgically removed the main immunoregulatory organs from large numbers of laboratory pigs to induce a state of severe immunodeficiency, enabling their long-term acceptance of human cells, and reported the results in a previous paper <sup>4</sup>.</p><p>\tIn this paper, we give a step-by-step description of the experimental procedure that is the core element of this technique, including key tips for its success. We provide precise information on immunosuppression therapies for different breeds of laboratory pig. This information will be of use to many researchers whose aim is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of human regenerative medical products, and we hope that it will be immediately implemented in animal experiments from the animal protection and cost-benefit perspectives.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Surgical procedure</strong></p><p>A: Thymectomy</p><p>\tThe adult porcine thymus consists of the left and right cervical lobes and the thoracic lobe, which occupies the entire mediastinum. Total thymectomy can be performed comparatively simply soon after birth in newborn piglets by making an incision to a point close to the sternum and pulling out the thymus <sup>7</sup>. However, in adult pigs the following procedure is used to perform total thymectomy without disarticulating the sternum. Standing on the left of the animal's head, the operator frees the left and right cervical lobes of the thymus from the cranial side and passes the right cervical lobe under the anterior neck muscles to enable traction to be applied on both the left and right cervical lobes simultaneously (Supplementary Information, Video 1). Traction is then applied to pull the left and right cervical lobes to the cranial side, and the thoracic lobe in the anterior mediastinum is carefully dissected and removed (Fig. 1a).</p><p><br></p><p>B: Splenectomy</p><p>\tThe spleen contains large quantities of B cells involved in antibody production, and in pigs, in particular its volume is extremely large. Splenectomy in pigs is the subject of particular attention for liver regeneration <sup>8</sup> that changes perfusion in the portal region, and for the production of diabetic model animals <sup>9</sup>. In splenectomy in pigs, it is important that the splenic body omental vessels, short gastric vessels, and the splenic vessels, all of which are large, are carefully ligated (Fig. 1b).</p><p><br></p><p>C: Gastrostomy formation </p><p>\tWhen producing long-term immunosuppression, tube insertion in the stomach can be a source of infection, and great care and attention are required. Because pigs are quadrupeds, it is important that the gastrostomy be inserted at a different site from the greater curvature of the central gastric corpus or the anterior surface, the locations used in humans. It must be inserted high up, near the cardiac part of the stomach, to take account of the animal's position standing on four legs. To avoid the creation of dead space, a Witzel tube is worked through the serosa (Fig. 1c) and then attached directly to the abdominal wall, the tube is brought out in the back via a subcutaneous tunnel, and a drug injection port is attached.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Immunosuppressant administration to laboratory pigs</strong></p><p>\tPorcine models have long been used for the preclinical validation of organ transplants, and the effective concentrations of immunosuppressants are known to differ greatly from those in humans. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and other calcineurin inhibitors in <em>in vitro</em> tests of peripheral blood lymphocyte stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) are 13\u201319-fold higher, and even for mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) the concentration is 1.5-fold higher. For methylprednisone, however, the value is 0.4-fold, indicating that unlike other laboratory animals, pigs respond well to steroids <sup>10</sup>. An immunosuppression protocol based on the oral administration of tacrolimus and MMF <sup>11</sup> and a steroid tapering method <sup>12</sup> has been reported for use in porcine allogeneic organ transplants, that is, transplanting an organ from one pig into another.</p><p>\tHowever, not enough is known about the xenogeneic transplantation of human-derived cells or tissues into pigs. Numerous xenogeneic transplantations of porcine organs and tissues into monkeys have been conducted to enable their potential use in humans, but our present model is the opposite combination, i.e., transplantation of human cells to pigs. Kawamura <em>et al</em>. administered three different immunosuppressants when evaluating human-derived myocardial sheets in laboratory mini-pigs (CLAWN mini-pigs), but long-term graft survival was not achieved <sup>13</sup>. Our method uses the major porcine immune organs. We removed the thymus and spleen, and carefully administered the abovementioned three immunosuppressants via a gastrostomy tube.</p><p>\tWe established an experimental animal model, comprising three-way crossbred pigs, G\u00f6ttingen mini-pigs <sup>4</sup>, CLAWN mini-pigs, and micro mini-pigs <sup>6</sup>, and produced a protocol capable of inducing the long-term survival of human-derived cells and tissues (Table 1).</p><p>\t&nbsp;The most crucial and helpful parameter in keeping pigs under immunosuppressive treatment is the change in body weight. Many medications cause asitia and often result in vomiting and diarrhea subsequently. For instance, MMF is well known to have such side effects. Vomiting interferes with dosing and, importantly, diarrhea increases the blood level of tacrolimus, the principal immunosuppressant used as the primary medication. Careful observation of body weight, as well as the behavior, enables detection of early signs of gastrointestinal disorders. It will be effective to feed piglets with 100 mL of milk substitute (Sanikko one, Marubeni Nisshin Feed Co., Ltd.), twice a day, to prevent dehydration and ameliorate vomiting and/or diarrhea. To alleviate the side effects, divided administration with uneven doses also deserves consideration as a chronopharmacological approach <sup>14</sup>.</p><p>\tWe are confident that the information in this paper will be useful to many researchers for non-clinical and clinical application validation studies in human-sized animals of human-derived regenerative medical products produced by the latest techniques, from both the efficacy and safety perspectives.</p>"

            "content": "The procedure consists of a pre-operative step (Step 1-7), thymectomy (Step 8-15), splenectomy (Step 16-21), gastrostomy (Step 22-36), and treatment with immunosuppressants (Step 37-38). Additionally, in vitro PBMC proliferation (Step 39-61) and pharmacokinetic assessments (Step 62-79) are performed.\n(A) Surgical operations\nPre-operative STEP \u25cfTiming 45 min\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nIt is important to perform splenectomy and gastrostomy after fasting for more than 24 hours.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sedate the pig with midazolam (0.3 mg/kg, i.m.), and atropine (0.04 mg/kg, i.m.) and wait until the pig is completely calm. This sedation can be given before transfer to the operating room.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Administer buprenorphine (0.01~0.02 mg/kg, i.m.) for 30 min before the start of surgery\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the surgical preparation room, shave the puncture site under inhaled isoflurane with 2 liter/min oxygen via a face mask. (3~5%).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insert a 22-gauge angiocatheter into posterior auricular vein to access i.v. and place a secure airway.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nEndotracheal intubation with a 6.5- to 7.5-mm tube is preferred for airway protection.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After shaving, move to the operating room, place in the supine position.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deliver ongoing maintenance anesthesia with 1\u20132% isoflurane through a nose cone and mechanically ventilated closed-loop anesthesia machine.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nPulse oximetry, body temperature and heart rate must be monitored through anesthesia induction, maintenance and recovery.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Disinfect the operation area.\nThymectomy \u25cfTiming 20-30 min\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use sterile surgical instruments\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perform incision of the skin on the upper manubrium of the sternum from near the midline neck hyoid bone (approximately 7 cm)\n10. Perform dissection of subcutaneous tissue while avoiding the carotid artery and vagus nerve on both sides of the sternohyoid muscle\n11. Pinch the ends of the thymus on both sides of the sternohyoid muscle with forceps, and when dissecting the thymus and subcutaneous tissue, perform dissection to the back of the manubrium of the sternum\n12. Pass the right cervical lobe under the anterior neck muscles to enable traction to be applied on both the left and right cervical lobes simultaneously\n13. Traction is then applied to pull the left and right cervical lobes to the cranial side\n14. The thoracic lobe in the anterior mediastinum is carefully dissected and removed\n15. After thymectomy, suture the subcutaneous tissue and skin\nSplenectomy \u25cfTiming 20-30 min\n16. Perform a midline incision from the region proximal to the xiphoid process to the lower abdomen\n17. Perform incision to the muscle layer using a scalpel, and perform incision of the peritoneum using an electric scalpel\n18. After performing peritoneal incision, secure field of view of the perisplenic region by using a retractor\n19. Lift the spleen to a position where the three blood vessels (splenic body omental vessels, short gastric vessels, and the splenic vessels) of the spleen are visible\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nWhen lifting the spleen, dissect the renal fascia in advance, and after dissection, by putting gauze in the space created, the three blood vessels in the spleen are easily visible\n20. Perform ligation at one place of the splenic artery and short gastric artery on the splenic side and two places on the abdominal side. Subsequently, resect the section between the ligation points\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nDissect the part away from the ligation position to prevent hemorrhage\n21. After performing vessel dissection, remove the spleen\nGastrostomy \u25cfTiming 20-30 min\n22. Perform gastric fistula tube attachment after splenectomy\n23. Prepare an intravenous tube with about 1/3 of the drip chamber remaining (Fig 2a)\n24. Secure a field of view of the region surrounding the short stomach artery ligature of the stomach\n25. Put a thread around the planned incision site on the upper part on the side of the greater curvature of the stomach (for performing purse\u2010string suturing in step 27)\n26. Using an electric scalpel, make a 1 to 1.5 cm incision required for gastrostomy tube insertion\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nThe surgical assistant lifts the both sides of the incision with tweezers, etc. so that the gastric contents do not leak when the stomach is incised.\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\nIn comparison with humans and dogs, pigs may have delayed gastric emptying, so the gastric contents may remain in the stomach. On the day before surgery, give easily digestible feed such as liquid feed\n27. After inserting the drip chamber side of the processed gastrostomy tube into the stomach, perform purse\u2010string suture to prevent the tube from coming out of the stomach (Fig. 2b)\n28. Fasten tube to stomach by Witzel sutures (Fig 2c)\n29. The tip of the gastrostomy tube is pulled out from the region surrounding the costal arch\n30. Join the fixed parts of the stomach tube with the abdominal wall at 4 to 5 places by 3-0 nylon thread\n31. In order to perform fixation of the gastric fistula tube, fix the opening of the subcutaneous tissue of the back with 4-0 nylon thread (Fig. 2d)\n32. Fill the tube with PG water jelly to prevent backflow of the gastric contents and close the tip with an injection cap or a screw-clamp compressor (Fig.2e)\n33. Place a jacket on the pig and store the gastrostomy tube in the pocket\n34. Postoperatively, further administer additional doses of Buprenorphine and meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and continue observation until emergence from anesthesia. Return the pig to the breeding cage after emergence from anesthesia\n35. Give analgesic at the same dose for 3 days, including the day of surgery. Twice daily in the case of buprenorphine, and once daily in the case of meloxicam.\n36. Postoperatively, disinfect the gastrostomy subcutaneous opening every two to three days\nAdministration of immunosuppressants\n37. Dissolve tacrolimus tablets in hot water at 50 to 60\u00b0C to create a 25 mg/mL solution. Prepare Prednisolone as a 5 mg/mL solution in the same manner. CELLCEPT powder for oral suspension in 31.8% (Chugai pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd.) was used as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Adjust the administration volume according to the administration dose. Table 1 shows the immunosuppressant recipe implemented at each facility.\n38. Perform immunosuppressant administration as follows\n\u2460\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Push the jelly filled in the tube into the stomach using 30 mL of heated water\n\u2461\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immunosuppressant administration\n\u2462\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Push the immunosuppressant remaining in the tube into the stomach using 30 mL of heated water\n\u2463\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fill the gastrostomy tube with 30 mL of PG water\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nPerform daily feeding and administration at a uniform time, as changes in immunosuppressant serum concentration levels differ between fasting and non-fasting states\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\nThe problems and solutions during immunosuppressant administration are summarized in Table 2.\n(B) In vitro and pharmacokinetics studies\nPBMC proliferation studies\nREAGENT SETUP\nFBS\nThe serum is thawed and heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 \u2103. The heat-inactivated serum is stored in 50-mL aliquots at -20 \u2103.\nRPMI-1640 (Culture medium)\nFor culturing\nPBMC derived from MMP peripheral blood, RPMI-1640 is supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin. The medium is stored at 4 \u2103 and warmed to at least room temperature before use.\nPHA stock solution\nPHA powder is dissolved in PBS to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. To make 1 mg/mL of stock solution, 10 mg of the powder is suspended in 10 mL of PBS. This solution can be stored in suitably sized aliquots at -20\u2103 for several month.\nCell Titer Glo Reagent\nThe 100 mL CellTiter-Glo buffer is transferred into the amber bottle containing CellTiter-Glo substrate to reconstitute the lyophilized enzyme/substrate mixture. Mix by gently vortexing. This reagent can be stored in suitably sized aliquots at -20\u2103 for several month.\nBefore conducting the PBMC proliferation study, we optimized the assay system as below. Cell proliferation depends on cell density, stimulant concentration and incubation time. In order to determine the optimal assay condition for evaluating the immunosuppressant, we investigated these factors. We examined the following three conditions; (1) cell density: 1 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells - 2 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells / well, (2) stimulant (PHA): 0.1 \u2013 10 \u03bcg/mL, (3) incubation time: 48 - 96 h. As a result, the sub-maximum proliferative activity was observed under the conditions of cell density of 5 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells / well in 96 well round bottom plate with 3 \u03bcg/mL PHA after 72 h incubation.\n(A) Isolation of PBMC \u25cf TIMING 1.5 h\n39. Collect approximately 7 mL of blood with a sodium heparinized 10-ml syringe from male micro mini-pig.\n40. Transfer 5 mL of fresh blood into 15-mL conical tubes containing 5 mL of PBS and gently mix by drawing the blood and buffer in and out of a pipette.\n41. Aliquot 5 mL of Ficoll-Paque PLUS into two 15-mL conical tubes (one Ficoll tube for every 5 mL of diluted blood).\n42. Place the tip of the pipette against inside of the tube, carefully layer 5 mL of diluted blood onto the 5 mL of Ficoll-Paque PLUS already filled.\n43. Centrifuge the tubes at 400 g for 30 min at room temperature.\n44. Using a clean pipette, carefully collect the white layer of PBMC between plasma and Ficoll-Paque PLUS and transfer the cells to a clean 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 20 mL of RPMI-1640.\n45. After gentle pipetting, centrifuge the tubes at 400g for 10 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\n46. Resuspend the cells thoroughly in 20 mL RPMI-1640 by pipetting.\n47. Count cells using a 1: 2 dilution with trypan blue. We typically see 20 - 50 \u00d7 10\n6\nPBMCs isolated from 5 mL of blood.\n\u25a0 PAUSE POINT\nIf needed, PBMCs can be stocked frozen by using CELLBANKER 1 plus. Although the survival rate decreases to 50-70% by cryopreservation of cells, the reactivity to PHA does not change. When using, dissolve promptly in a 37\u2103 hot bath, wash with culture medium and count the number of live cells before use.\n(B) Plating and proliferation assay\n\u25cf TIMING\nPreparation and plating for in vitro simulation takes 1.5 h. Cells are usually harvested 3 d after the stimulation.\n48.\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge the tubes at 1,400 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.\n49.\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend cells in culture medium at a final concentration of 5 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells per mL.\n50.\u00a0\u00a0Transfer 100 \u03bcL (5 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells) per well of cell suspension to 96 well round-bottom plate.\n51.\u00a0\u00a0Add 60 \u03bcL of culture media and 20 \u03bcL of 10-fold concentration of MPA to the cells.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nTo make 10-fold concentration of MPA serial dilution for dose-response curve, dilute MPA solubilized in MeOH serially with MeOH and further dilute 100 times with culture media. As a result, the carry-in of MEOH into the culture system is 0.1%.\n52.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pre-incubate the cells for 30 min at 37\u2103.\n53.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 20 \u03bcL of 30 \u03bcg/mL PHA to the cells at a final concentration of 3 \u03bcg/mL.\n54.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate the cells for 3 days at 37\u2103.\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nTo reduce the edge effect in culture plate, avoid using the outer wells of the plate for PBMC cultures, as these are most subject to evaporation and temperature distribution over period of incubation. The outer wells can be filled with PBS.\n(C) Cell viability assay \u25cf TIMING 1 h\n55.\u00a0\u00a0Equilibrate the plate and its contents at RT for 30 min.\n56.\u00a0\u00a0Remove 100 \u03bcL of culture media from each well.\n57.\u00a0\u00a0Add 100 \u03bcL of CellTiter-Glo Reagent.\n58.\u00a0\u00a0Mix contents on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis.\n59.\u00a0\u00a0Allow the plate to incubate for 10 min at RT to stabilize luminescent signal.\n60.\u00a0\u00a0Transfer 100 \u03bcL of cell lysate to opaque-walled multiwell plates.\n61.\u00a0\u00a0Measure luminescence by micro plate reader.\nPharmacokinetics studies\n(A) Central venous catheter (CVC) placement \u25cfTIMING 1h\n62. Perform catheterization surgery one week before pharmacokinetics study in male micro mini-pig\n63. The preoperative procedure is performed in the same manner as steps 1 to 4\n64. Incise the skin and subcutaneous muscular layer 2-3 cm from the cervical ventral midline approximately 3 -4 cm to the head side along the body axis from approximately 2 cm from the anterior border of scapula to the sternum\n65. Dissect the internal jugular vein using artery Forceps\n66. After dissection, ligate the blood vessels on the head side and thread catheter fixation thread in chest side blood vessel\n67. Insert CVC 5-8 cm into the vessel and perform fixation with a thread so that the catheter does not move. In addition, perform fixation of the muscular layer of the neck\n\u25b2CRITICAL STEP\nAdjust the insertion depth of the catheter based on the size of the animal.\n68. After confirming that the blood can be collected with a catheter, inject 2 mL of heparinized saline from the end of the catheter and attach an injection cap\n69. Suture the muscular layer, subcutaneous tissue and the incision in the skin\n70. Attach the clip that came with kit at approximately 1 cm from the incision to the catheter that came out of the body through the incision on the skin, and perform fixation of the clip by suturing on the skin\n71. Store in the pocket of the jacket from the clip fixation part to the end part\n(B) Treatment with mycophenolate mofetil\n\u25cf TIMING It takes 30 min to prepare the MMF solution and administer the drug.\n72. CELLCEPT powder for oral suspension in 31.8% (Chugai pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd.) was used as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Alternatively, it is possible to use CELLCEPT Capsule 250 (Chugai pharmaceutical co.,Ltd)\n73. The suspension is administered via gastrostomy.\n74. The dose of MMF was 20 mg/kg in the morning, 30 mg/kg afternoon.\n75. Administration in the morning is carried out after 15minutes after feeding.\n!CAUTION\nIt is necessary to adjust of feeding time because PK profile would be change due to the fed/fast condition.\n(C) Blood sampling and measurement of plasma mycophenolic acid concentration\n\u25cf TIMING It takes 15min to collect the blood and prepare the plasma at each point.\n76.\u00a0\u00a0The pharmacokinetic studies of the MMF were carried out 7 days after the start of administration.\n77.\u00a0\u00a0Approximately 0.5 mL of blood was collected with a sodium heparinized syringe from CV at each sampling point (before dosing, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 24h after dosing.)\n!CAUTION\nBlood sampling at 8h. was performed just before afternoon treatment\n78.\u00a0\u00a0The blood samples were centrifuged at 1,200 x G for 5 min at 25\u2103. Isolated plasma was stored at -20 ~ -30\u2103 until analysis.\n\u25a0PAUSE POINT\nPlasma sample can be stored at -30\u2103 for several months\n79.\u00a0\u00a0Plasma concentration of mycophenolic acid was measured by LC/MS/MS method"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Majority of research on human regenerative medicine has focused on the use of human mature cells/tissues and stem cell derived products. To ensure their safety and efficacy for clinical application, preclinical testing in large animals such as pigs, using pre-clinical and clinical matching protocols, is required. However, presently, there is no universal, stable, adjustable immunosuppressed pig model in which human regenerative cell and tissue products may be evaluated. Consequently, we established a controllable immunocompromised pig model by surgical excision of immune organs and varying the administration of immunosuppressive agents based on the physical condition and pharmacokinetic profile. Here, we describe the precise experimental procedure and provide information on immunosuppression therapies in different breeds of laboratory pigs. We provide practical information for the production of operational SCID pigs. We believe that our procedure may be immediately implemented in human-to-pig experiments, resulting in cost-benefit perspectives and furthering the development of new regenerative medicine.&nbsp;</p>",
