In 100mm vacuum gas plasma-treated plates, seed cancer cells at 5-10% confluency.\r\n  3. Incubate cells at standard culture conditions of 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2.\r\n  4. Allow 4-8 hours for cells to adhere.\r\n  5. Using AxioCam MRm camera and Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope, acquire first image \\(time point zero) using both brightfield and fluorescence filters.\r\n  6. Set microscope to acquire images every 10 minutes for a period of 72 hours. Image acquisition intervals will vary based on expected doubling times of cells from particular tissues of origin.\r\n  7. Assemble movie of individual images using ImageJ Java-based software.\r\n  8. Analyze cell cycle division kinetics and asymmetric vs. symmetric stem cell division:\r\n       a. Observe for anaphase in the parent cell to track individual cell divisions. Record the time to first division \\(doubling time).\r\n\n\n     b. Observe for anaphase in the daughter cells from the original parent cell. Record the time to first division of these daughter cells.\r\n\n\n     c. Determine if there are significant differences in doubling times between the different subsets of cells and between the two daughters from a single parent stem cell from each subset.\r\n\n\n     d. If using a fluorescent reporter-based approach to identify subsets expressing stem cell genes, observe for asymmetric versus symmetric distribution of fluorescence in the daughter cell after division of the parent cell. This may indicate retention or disappearance of stem cell properties in the daughter cells.\r\n\n\n     e. Note for cell death in the daughter cells."

            "content": "Typical mammalian cancer cells divide every 20-24 hours. These cells are rapid cycling, but since they lack self-renewal ability, they will likely cease to divide after five to ten divisions. These individual cells are expected to become senescent with time. This dying process can be seen by real-time visualization and should be noted. On the contrary, stem-like cancer cells are expected to have the longest doubling times and slowest rates of division. These stem-like cells may divide symmetrically or asymmetrically. Under conditions of low confluency and minimal cell-cell contact, it is expected that a high proportion of cells will divide symmetrically, resulting in two identical daughter stem cells, in an effort to repopulate. As confluency increases and cell-cell contact develops, it is expected that there will be an increase in the frequency of asymmetrically dividing cells."

Two-dimensional image data is repeatedly collected at distinct time intervals, and a movie is assembled. Applications include assessment of cell migration, division, communication, growth, and death. A unique advantage to time-lapse video microscopy for assessment of these parameters is that data is collected at the single-cell level, allowing one to assess heterogeneity within a mixed population of cells. Therefore, this is particularly advantageous for cancer biology and stem cell biology. In this protocol, we describe the use of time-lapse video microscopy for \\(1) the real-time monitoring of cell cycle kinetics of heterogeneous populations of cancer cells, and \\(2) the real-time assessment of symmetric versus asymmetric stem cell division.",
