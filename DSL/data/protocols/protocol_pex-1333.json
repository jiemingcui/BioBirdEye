            "content": "<p>Currently, there is no general method to estimate absolute RNA-protein interaction frequencies and a quantitative test is needed to assess whether any non-random interaction with an RNA exists. The frequencies of RNA-protein complexes, per-cell and per-interaction partner, would enable the fundamental characterization of RNA-protein interaction networks. Determining the targets of an RBP by conventional approaches, such as enrichment over negative control immunopurification or by clustering of cross-links, are ultimately but indirectly determining if the absolute count of an RNA-protein complex in the cell is abnormally high. Defining RNA-protein interaction events per-cell and per-protein in absolute quantities, in contrast, may provide a framework for describing a global and widely reproducible view of RNA-protein interactions.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Here, we report a refinement of current CLIP protocols, termed easyCLIP. easyCLIP produces conventional CLIP-seq libraries, quantifies RNA cross-links-per-protein and provides visual confirmation of each step.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Run PCR program (98C 10s, then cycles of 98C 5 s, 65C 5 s, 72C 45 s) and stop a few reactions into the exponential phase. Reactions should not start to plateau.\n43. Purify PCR reactions using a NucleoSpin\u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL).\u00a0Instead of the kit's wash buffer, use freshly prepared 85% ethanol. Libraries are ready for quantification and sequencing.\nCross-link rate determination\nCreation of a protein standard\nCreate a protein standard by making a two-fold dilution series of the desired epitope and aliquoting into single-use striptubes of ~15 \u00b5L (see methods section). For the HA-tag, for example, any purified HA-tagged protein will suffice.\n1.

Make two-fold dilutions down from 20-200 ng/\u00b5L, depending on how protein is available, for a total of 8 concentrations of protein.\n4. Aliquot ~14 \u00b5L of each concentration into striptubes and freeze until use at -80\u00b0.\nCreation of RNA standard\nAn RNA standard to determine fluorescence per molecule number is created by UV cross-linking hnRNP C, purifying a large amount, aliquoting and quantifying by quantitative western blot.\n1.

Ligate overnight (17 hours) with 20 pmol labeled L5, and 2 \u00b5L high concentration T4 RNA ligase (NEB).\n6. Combine samples and split into ~20 aliquots comprising 2.5% of the beads (~10 ng hnRNP C each, ~400 ng total purified) in ~15 \u00b5L 1.6X NuPAGE buffer, freeze in dry ice and keep long term at -80\u00b0.\nImmunoblot with ~1:3000 \u03b1hnRNP C conjugated to AF790 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32308 AF790), or other suitable antibody, in PBS blocking buffer (LI-COR) for ~1 hour at room temperature. Use protein standards to quantify the amount of hnRNP C in the L5-ligated band by quantitative western blotting. ~5000 fluorescence units per fmol is a typical result.\nCross-link rate determination using standards\nUV Crosslinking (1 h)\n1. Remove media, wash cells once with 4\u00b0-16\u00b0 PBS and aspirate PBS.\n2. Place dish on ice, remove lid and UV cross-link 0.3J/cm\n2\n3.

Thaw lysates by hand and then keep at 4\u00b0.\n6. Sonicate lysate for 20-30 seconds at 7 second bursts with microtip sonicator at 10% power\n7. Spin lysate at 14 krcf for 10 min at 4\u00b0; transfer cleared lysate to new tube\n8. Add lysates to anti-HA or antibody-precojugated protein G beads. IP 1 h at 4\u00b0.\n9. Wash beads 1X High Str, 1X High Salt, 10min each at 4\u00b0 w/rotation, then 1X Low Salt (1 mL all) (Note: the above IP and washes can be performed robotically in a KingFisher machine with no visible effect.)\n10. Perform nuclease digestion: 30\u00b0, 15s 1350 rpm, 45s rest, for 3-10 minutes with 0.01-0.1 U/\u00b5L RNAse ONE.\n11. Remove RNAse mixture and add 1 mL of 4\u00b0 High Str buffer to deactivate RNAse ONE.\n12. Wash beads 2X 1 mL NT2, then step down volume in NT2.\n13. Resuspend beads in 70 \u00b5L of 5'PNK reaction.\n14. Incubate in thermomixer at 37\u00b0 for 15', 15 s 1000 RPM, 15 s rest.\n15. Wash 2X NT2 and step down volume in NT2.\n16. Resuspend beads in 70 \u00b5L of 5' ligation reaction.\n17. Incubate at 16\u00b0 overnight, 15 s 1350 RPM, 90 s rest.\nGel (~6 h)\n18. Wash 1-2X NT2 and step down volume in NT2.\n19. Thaw aliquot of RNA standard (cross-linked hnRNP C, frozen in 1.6X LDS), and PCR striptubes of pre-aliquoted protein standard.\n20. Add 10 \u00b5L of protein standard PCR tubes to a set of striptubes with 10 \u00b5L 3.2X LDS using a multichannel pipette.\n21. Resuspend beads in 20 \u00b5L 1.6X LDS.\u00a0Heat all samples at 75\u00b0 for 15min, applying intermittent shaking to samples with beads.\n22. Run samples in NuPAGE gel @180V 30-50 minutes, transfer to nitrocellulose (.45 um) at 400 mA for 27'.\n23. Place membrane in PBS, scan on Odessy CLx (lowest quality/resolution OK)\n24. Perform a western blot against the epitope on the purified proteins and protein standard.\nCalculation (1 h)\n25. Fit the protein standards to a hyperbolic curve. The fit should be very good.\n26. Use the hyperbolic curve to estimate immunopurified protein running in the non-cross-linked protein band. 27. Let this amount be \u201cP\u201d.\n28. Divide the fmols of RNA in the RNA standard by the observed L5 signal to obtain fmols RNA per fluorescence unit. Let this amount be \u201cF\u201d.\n29. Determine the amount of cross-linked RNA in immunopurified samples by multiplying fluorescence by the fmols/fluorescence of the RNA standard. Let this amount be \u201cR\u201d, calculated as R = (observed fluorescence for RNA) * F.\n30. Add the fmols of cross-linked RNA to the fmols of monomeric, un-cross-linked protein to obtain the total amount of protein. Let this amount be \u201cPt\u201d, calculated as Pt = R + P.\n31. Divide the fmols of RNA by the total amount of protein to obtain the fraction cross-linked and ligated. This is calculated as R/Pt.\n32. Multiply by 2 to adjust for ~50% ligation efficiency. So the cross-link rate is 2*R/Pt, or 2*R/(R + P).\nCombination of cross-link rate with sequencing date\nFor a given location or RNA, the number of reads in a CLIP library at that location or RNA as a fraction of all reads is the fraction of cross-links at that RNA or location. This fraction may be multiplied by the cross-links per protein to determine the cross-links per protein at the given location or RNA."

Running an hnRNP C sample (or any other good positive control protein - CELF1, hnRNP D, FUBP1) will ensure that you have enough signal for dot blot tests despite sample loss or dilution. The amount of fluorescence extracted from a lane as determined by dot blotting the extract (before poly(dT) purification) is generally greater than the amount of fluorescence on the gel (that is, the apparent efficiency is often over 100%), due to increased brightness per molecule when dot blotting the extract. To determine the success of the poly(dT)-bead purification and elution, save some of the eluate from the poly(dT) beads to dot blot - this corresponds to the input to the RT reaction.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>In general, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) may be considered a protein with an abnormally frequent interaction with RNA, and a \"target RNA\" for a specific protein may be considered an RNA with an abnormally frequent interaction with that protein. Traditional ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-sequencing analysis methods generally define interactions by methods that are indirectly assessing the latter. However, there has been limited direct assessment of these metrics by determining RNA cross-link rates or the RNA-binding profiles of non-RBPs.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, we describe a method to determine RNA cross-link rates and create sequencing libraries for a protein of interest, either of which may be performed on their own. easyCLIP is a relatively short, reliable, and efficient CLIP method, with the capacity to directly visualize RNA libraries and diagnose methodological problems. By combining the sequencing data and cross-link rates, the absolute frequency of given cross-links may be compared between control and experimental proteins, to nominate potential RBPs and distinctive RNA-protein interactions.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>",
