            "content": "_Sleeping Beauty_ \\(SB) transposons are an important insertional mutagenesis tool for cancer gene discovery by performing forward genetic screens in mice<sup>1\u20133</sup>. To broaden the capabilities and impact of SB-driven cancer gene discovery models, we set out to develop a new methodology that would allow rapid and reproducible identification of SB transposon insertion sites from bulk tumor tissue down to the single-cell level. We devised an approach that relies on random shearing of genomic DNA to discrete 200 bp fragments that are enriched for transposon sequences using liquid-capture hybridization with probes directed to the inverted repeats of the SB transposon ends. SBCapSeq is both an experimental sequencing approach and bioinformatic workflow optimized for Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing. SBCapSeq permits the selective, semi-quantitative, and scalable deep sequencing of _Sleeping Beauty_ Transposon insertion sites from adaptor-ligated, bar-coded DNA libraries from both bulk tumor specimens and single tumor cell genomes."

Genomic DNA extraction \\(Timing overnight, 2 hours hands-on)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Choose one source of genomic DNA below.\r\n     a. Isolate genomic DNA from flash frozen specimens \u2014 Perform DNA extraction from frozen tissue according to the Gentra Puregene Handbook protocol for DNA purification from tissue frozen in liquid nitrogen. Using a razor blade or scalpel, shave off fine sections of frozen tissue equaling 10 mg, working on ice at all times, and add directly to Cell Lysis Solution. Follow the protocol exactly, including a 55 \u00b0C overnight incubation step in Proteinase K for maximum yields. In the final steps of isolation, re-suspend DNA pellet in 100 \u03bcL of DNA Hydration Solution. Quantify once DNA is completely dissolved \u2014this step can be enhanced by overnight incubation at room temperature or 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n   b. Isolate genomic DNA from whole genome amplified single cells \u2014 Single cells can be isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting followed by whole genome amplification according to methods outlined in Leung _et al_.\n4\nand Wang, Y. _et al_.\n5\n. Genomic DNA obtained from these methods provides high-quality DNA in amounts amendable to the library preparation and sequencing methods described below.\n2. Quantify genomic DNA extraction by either NanoDrop\u2122 Lite Spectrophotometer or Qubit\n\u00ae\n3.0 Fluorometer \\(using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit per manufacturer\u2019s recommended instructions) to ensure sufficient yield to proceed with barcode library preparation. Repeat A.1 as needed to obtain \u2265500 ng of genomic DNA for library preparation.\n**B. Library preparation \\(Timing 4.5 hrs total, 75 mins hands-on)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSB capture hybridization sequencing libraries are constructed from 500 ng genomic DNA. Sheared genomic DNA of approximately 200 bp is achieved using one method of DNA fragmentation below.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Fragment genomic DNA by enzymatic shearing:\r\n  a. Follow the Ion Xpress\u2122 Plus and Ion Plus Library Preparation for the AB Library Builder\u2122 System User Guide for barcoded libraries.\r\n\n\nb.

When starting the run, choose Auto SizeSelection and Auto Shearing to 200 bp target shear-size. \r\n\n\nd. After the run, samples may contain small amounts of Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent. Remove by placing samples in a DynaMag\u2122-2 magnet for two minutes and transferring the supernatant to a new tube.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Fragment genomic DNA by acoustic shearing:\r\n  a. Reference the Covaris S220 System S220 Series User Manual for appropriate setup and maintenance of the Covaris System.\r\n\n\nb. Use protocols for fragmentation in 130 \u03bcL volume to produce more consistent results.\r\n\n\nc. Use a buffer of at least 0.1X TE for shearing to produce more consistent results.\r\n\n\nd. Use screw cap microtubes with double rods to decrease sample splattering during a run. \r\n\n\ne. Carefully pipette genomic DNA into the microTUBE AFA Fiber Pre-Slit Snap-Cap, ensuring that no air bubbles remain within the DNA and buffer.\r\n\n\nf. Run the Covaris DNA Shearing protocol for 200 Target BP Peak found in the User Manual using the following settings: Peak Incident Power \\(W): 140, Duty Factor: 10%, Cycles per Burst: 200, Treatment Time \\(s): 180, Temperature \\(\u00b0C): 7, Water Level: 13.\r\n\n\ng. Collect the fragmented genomic DNA by pipetting through the microTUBE cap slit.\r\n\n\nh. Continue with library preparation according to the Ion Plus Library Preparation for the AB Library Builder\u2122 System User Guide for barcoded libraries. Reference the specific protocol for library preparation from pre-sheared genomic DNA. Elute DNA libraries in water and carefully transfer all supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Optional protocol pause point: barcoded DNA libraries can be stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight or at -20 \u00b0C for up to 1 week._\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**C. Quality control check and purification of bar-coded DNA library \\(Timing 40 min)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Use 1 \u03bcL of eluate from step B.1.d or B.2.h above to check the bar-coded DNA library integrity with an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA nanochip designed for use in the Bioanalyzer 2100 to measure the average fragment length of the sheared DNA libraries. Follow the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit Quick Start Guide and select DNA, High Sensitivity in the Bioanalyzer software. An example sample trace at this step is provided in \"Figure 2a\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4241/original/Figure_2.jpg?1454608225.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Purify bar-coded DNA library fragments using Agencourt\n\u00ae\nAMPure XP beads:\r\n  a. Add 1.5X volume \\(45 \u03bcL) of Agencourt\n\u00ae\nAMPure XP beads to the bar-coded DNA library eluate.\r\n\n\nb. Follow the bind and wash steps in the Agencourt\n\u00ae\nAMPure protocol, except use 80% ethanol for the washes.\r\n\n\nc. Elute in 32 \u03bcL of TE\n-1\n, pH8.0. Save 1 \u03bcL for analysis using Bioanalyzer 2100.\r\n\n\nd. Transfer 30 \u03bcL of eluted product to a fresh 1.7 mL low-bind tube, ensuring no beads are carried over.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Optional protocol pause point: bar-coded DNA libraries may be stored at 4\u00b0C overnight or at -20\u00b0C for up to 1 week._\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**D. DNA library size selection \\(Timing 2 hrs)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Combine 30 \u03bcL of the eluate from step C.2.d with 10 \u03bcL of the Pippin Prep loading dye with Marker L. Mix well with micropipette and briefly spin to collect in bottom of tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Load 40 \u03bcL onto one lane of a 2% agarose gel for size selection of DNA libraries using Pippin Prep according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Set the following parameters to ensure the majority of fragments are within the recommended length for Ion Torrent DNA sequencing libraries: Target = 315 bp, Start = 290 bp, End = 340 bp.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. After run is complete, collect the eluted sample \\(~40 \u03bcL) containing the size-selected DNA library fragments.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Purify size-selected DNA library fragments using Agencourt\n\u00ae\nAMPure XP beads:\r\n  a. Add 1.5X volume \\(60 \u03bcL) of Agencourt\n\u00ae\nAMPure XP beads to the bar-coded DNA library eluate.\r\n\n\nb. Follow the bind and wash steps in the Agencourt\n\u00ae\nAMPure protocol, except use 80% ethanol for the washes.\r\n\n\nc. Elute in 25 \u03bcL of TE\n-1\n, pH8.0 and transfer all of eluted product into a fresh 1.7 mL low-bind tube, ensuring no beads are carried over.\r\n\n\nd. An example sample trace at this step is provided in \"Figure 2b\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4241/original/Figure_2.jpg?1454608225.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Optional protocol pause point: Purified Pippin Prep size-selected DNA library fragments may be stored at -20 \u00b0C for up to 1 week._\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**E. PCR enrichment of DNA libraries after size selection \\(Timing 2.5 hrs)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSize selected DNA libraries are enriched using Platinum PCR mix, and Library Amplification Primer Mix from the Ion Plus Fragmented Library Kit.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1.

Clean up the PCR reaction with AMPure XP beads:\r\n  a. Add 1.8X volume of beads \\(234 \u03bcL) to the reaction and follow the cleanup protocol.\r\n\n\nb. At final step, elute DNA in 52 \u03bcL TE-1 pH 8.0 buffer and carefully transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\r\n\n\nc. Use 1 \u03bcL to measure the concentration of DNA with a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit using manufacturer\u2019s recommended instructions. Using Qubit readings, determine the concentration of each DNA library before proceeding to Capture Hybridization.\r\n\n\nd.

Validate and quantify library \\(Timing 4.5 hrs total, 3.5 hrs hands-on)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Using 1 \u03bcL of eluate from step H.4, measure the average fragment length of the captured library on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using a high sensitivity DNA nanochip.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Using 2 \u03bcL of eluate from step H.4, quantify libraries using ViiA\u2122 7 Real-Time PCR System and the Ion library TaqMan Quantitation Kit, as directed by the manufacturer.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Determine the concentration of the ~30 \u03bcL of eluate from step H.4 for sequencing.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**J. Sequencing of SBCapSeq libraries \\(2-3 days)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Dilute sequencing libraries for Ion Torrent sequencing according to experimental design:\r\n  a. For sequencing a single SB Capture Hybridization library per PI\u2122 chip, prepare a diluted stock of eluted library from step H.4 to 50 pmol.\r\n\n\nb. For multi-plex sequencing of 2\u201316 individual SB Capture Hybridization libraries per PI\u2122 chip, prepare a diluted stock of consisting of a pool of 2\u201316 eluted libraries from step H.4 to 50 pmol.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Set up Ion Chef for Ion PI\u2122 Hi-Q\u2122 Chef Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the sequencing library/pooled-libraries mixture from step J.1. Ion Chef chip loading runs overnight.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. The next morning, prepare Ion Torrent Proton for sequencing and load PI\u2122 chip using the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A 500-flow sequencing run will complete in approximately 4 hours.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. After a sequencing run is complete, Torrent Suite\u2122 Software will align reads to a Reference Genome and generate a chip run report. Typically this analysis runs overnight.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. It is important to note that the portion of the PI\u2122 chip run report pertaining to the metrics for sequence data after aligning sequenced reads to a reference genome \\(for mouse the default is mm10) is expected to look similar to \"Figure 3\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4243/original/Figure_3.jpg?1454608227. Specifically, the range of expected Reference Coverage is between 1.1X to 2.9X and Unaligned bases is between 40% to 70% when successful sequencing of SBCapSeq libraries is achieved \\(see Figure 3). The variation in values differs depending upon the number of pooled libraries per chip and the complexity \\(e.g. transposon copy number, etc.) of SB insertions in a given tumor, or pooled set of tumors. This occurs because of SB Capture Hybridization enrichment of non-Reference Genome reads belonging to the SB transposon are not able to map well to the Reference genome.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Once the sequencing run and genome alignment is complete,  download and archive the Ion Torrent Suite generated sequencing data files.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**K. SBCapSeq data analysis \\(~1 day)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote that elements below contained in square brackets \\(\n\\[text]\n) are variables that the user must set; before running the code replace\n\\[text]\nwith your non-bracketed text. Refer to the README.md file at \"https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq\":https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq for detailed instructions and a demonstration of this workflow on a toy data set.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Prepare computer workstation for data analysis by downloading the required installer and python scripts from \"https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq\":https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq. If you download the master archive \\( \"https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq/archive/master.zip\":https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq/archive/master.zip ), make sure to unzip the contents. Once you do this, you should see an installer script \\(\n'install.sh'\n), a python directory, and some documentation and license files.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Install the toolbox and reference indexes by executing the installer script \\(\n'install.sh'\n). Using Terminal.app \\(or similar terminal emulator), navigate to the directory containing the installer, then run the following command:\nbash install.sh\n3. Add the sbcapseq toolbox scripts to your system paths by running the following command:\nexport PATH=$HOME/nnlab/sbcapseq/bin:$PATH\n4. Convert the Ion Torrent Suite sequencing data to FASTQ format, if it is not already in this format. This can be done using samtools\n6\nand the\nsam2fastq.py\nscript:\r\n  \r\n\n\na. Converting from SAM format to FASTQ format:\nsamtools view -S \\[reads.sam] | sam2fastq.py - > \\[reads.fastq]\nb. Converting from BAM format to FASTQ format:\nsamtools view \\[reads.sam] | sam2fastq.py - > \\[reads.fastq]\n5. Map the FASTQ reads to mouse TA sites using the\nfastq2tas.py\nscript:\nfastq2tas.py $HOME/nnlab/sbcapseq/srv \\[reads.fastq]\nThis will generate a folder containing a file detailing the TA sites \\(\ninsertions.txt\n) and a log file giving a breakdown of reads that made mapped to TA sites \\(\nlog.json\n).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6. Convert the TA sites to\nBED\nformat, and mask potential hotspots, using the following command:\ntas2bed.py -f \\[insertions.txt] | maskbed.py $HOME/nnlab/sbcapseq/srv/protonMaskSites.bed - > \\[insertions.bed]\n7. The\nBED\nfile format is suitable for several types of analysis \\(e.g. common insertion site statistical analysis) and may be used to visualize SB insertions in a genomics browser \\(e.g. UCSC Genome Browser, Integrative Genomics Viewer, or Integrated Genome Browser)."

For Step J \u2014 Sequencing of SBCapSeq libraries, select an appropriate Ion Torrent sequencing system configuration and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe authors have successfully used the SBCapSeq method and bioinformatic workflow to generate SB insertion site data from over 200 DNA libraries from a diverse set of SB induced tumor genomes, including Myeloid Leukemia \\(ML) and several solid tumors, for sequencing on the Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing platforms. DNA libraries have been successfully created from various tumor and non-tumor specimens and from populations of bulk tumor cells and matched single tumor cells. Using the semi-quantitative feature of this method, we were able to unambiguously identify genes mutated by SB that drive tumorigenesis and characterize tumor heterogeneity at an unprecedented level. We applied this methodology to analyze a completely penetrant SB-driven model of myeloid leukemia that recapitulates many of the molecular attributes of human ML \\(see Associated Publications reference for Mann _et al_., 2016). Our results show that the unbiased, semi-quantitative, and genome-wide capability for sequencing disease causing SB insertions in our mouse model of AML using the SBCapSeq method offers the most comprehensive view of single cell tumor heterogeneity to date.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRepresentative Bioanalyzer traces of a representative library from an SB-driven mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia carried through the various step in the protocol is shown in \"Figure 2\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4241/original/Figure_2.jpg?1454608225.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA representative PI\u2122 chip run report pertaining to the metrics for sequence data after aligning sequenced reads to a reference genome \\(for mouse the default is mm10) is presented in \"Figure 3\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4243/original/Figure_3.jpg?1454608227."

This protocol includes detailed procedures for genomic DNA isolation, library preparation, capture hybridization, target sequence enrichment, sequencing, and data analysis. The SBCapSeq method, which takes about 7\u201310 days to perform, permits semi-quantitative sequencing and has been specifically optimized for Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis genetic studies.",
