LPS was obtained from Sigma Aldrich Ireland \\(L2654-1MG) and was diluted to a final stock concentration of 1,000 \u03bcg/mL. A further dilution of stock concentration to diluent at a ratio of 1:5 was then applied to give a working concentration of 200 \u00b5g/mL. The diluent used was distilled water \\(DH2O) with 0.1% BSA, twice filtered with a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. Each concentration of LPS added to the cells under culture was incubated for a 24-hour period under the conditions described below. \r\n\n\nThe fluidic volumes of LPS, along with their corresponding concentrations for a 20-mL cell culture flask are summarised in Table 1.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4147/original/Table_1.jpg?1450264799\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Cell culture protocol**\r\n\n\nHUVEC cells were obtained from PromoCell GmbH, Germany \\(C-12203 HUVEC-c pooled).

Cells were isolated by centrifugation at 220 x g for 3 minutes. The cell pellet was finally resuspended in culture media."

Once the chip has been primed, introduce the cells via the loading chamber on the top left section of the biochip. All pumping is performed using the previously described centrifugal test stand \\(Table 2) and a 3D printed chip holder which allows three biochips to be tested in parallel \\(Fig. 1). Since the sedimentation takes place with the liquid bulk at rest, i.e. in the absence of flow, the cell capture efficiency of the V-cup array system is significantly higher than that of typical flow-driven systems. Initial cell capture tests were performed using 20-\u03bcm polystyrene beads to emulate cell behaviour and then these tests were repeated using HUVEC and EA.hy926 cells. In all cases, a high V-cup occupancy rate \\(> 95%) was observed \\(Fig. 2).\nSee figure in Figures section.\nTable 2: Centrifugal Test Stand Testing Protocol\nSee figure in Figures section.\nFigure 1: LiPhos single cell viewgraph. \\(a) Biochip schematic. \\(b) Three biochips under centrifugal microfluidic testing. \\(c) Single cell capture, analysis and PIN readout principles.\nSee figure in Figures section.\nFigure 2: V-cup array occupancy distribution for 20-\u00b5m polystyrene beads, HUVEC and EA.hy926 cells.

Whilst changes are present and detected, they are not as pronounced as the corresponding changes observed under TNF-\u03b1 exposure. Broadband light interrogation \\(BBLI) measures the scattering and absorbance bands \\(Fig. 5) and it is observed that light transmission is lowest for healthy HUVEC and increases with the inflammation-induced protein levels in the cells. AF intensities grow with the concentrations of LPS in each of the three wavelength bands of interest \\(Fig. 6) but the AF signal magnitudes are smaller than those observed under TNF-\u03b1 inflammation conditions.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4159/original/Figure_4.jpg?1450265101\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFigure 4: HUVEC which are \\(a) healthy and treated with LPS for 24 hours at \\(b) 5 ng/mL and \\(c) 10 ng/mL.
