            "content": "<p>The identification let alone prioritization of enzyme substrates is challenging. Current approaches for identifying specific substrates are specific to an enzyme or a class of enzymes and are often labor-intensive and not straightforward. Furthermore, modifying enzymes or co-substrates for capturing substrates can alter the biology of the system under study and produce a bias. Thus, unbiased, general and swift proteome-wide techniques avoiding enzyme or cosubstrate modification are needed. </p><p>Here, through an inventive experimental development, we designed a new technique called System-wide Identification and prioritization of Enzyme Substrates by Thermal Analysis (SIESTA) by applying TPP <sup>5</sup> or MS-CETSA <sup>6</sup> to samples treated in parallel with vehicle, the enzyme, co-substrate or both. Since PTMs can alter the thermal stability of a protein, SIESTA can probe the proteome-wide effects on thermal stability of specific PTMs and identify enzyme substrates. In the associated publication, we show that SIESTA can identify the substrates of Thioredoxin reductase 1, protein kinase B (AKT1) and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase-10 systems <sup>2</sup>. Since SIESTA can identify changes in stability resulting from even small modifications such as phosphorylation, we believe that it can be applied to most enzymes. </p><p>Experimental design, proteomics sample preparation and data analysis are the key stages of this protocol. In this protocol, we will elaborate on experimental design aspects and give a detailed protocol on SIETSA workflow. Finally, our SIESTA package on GitHub <sup>3</sup> can be used for data analysis. Here, we will use the AKT1 system as an example.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

            "content": "Experiment design considerations\nSIESTA\nexperiments are based on parallel monitoring of protein stability changes in cell lysate aliquots treated with vehicle, enzyme, its co-substrate, or a combination of the enzyme with co-substrate. Within this design, vehicle-, enzyme-, and co-substrate-treated samples serve as controls. Proteins which demonstrate a specific shift in stability in samples treated with a combination of enzyme and co-substrate are considered the putative substrates of the enzyme under study. If the enzyme has more than one co-substrate, the additional cosubstrate(s) can be used as additional control(s). The concentration of enzyme and its co-substrate should be in the physiological range. SIESTA can be performed using either TPP or PISA workflows. Below is the protocol based on TPP. A schematic workflow can be found in Figure 1 of the associated publications\n1,2\n.\nSample preparation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Culture cells in multiple 175 cm\n2\nflasks (Sarstedt), detach with trypsinization and wash twice with PBS.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Resuspend in 12 mL 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, with complete protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor tablets.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0Lyse the resuspended cells by five freeze-thaw cycles in multiple 1.5 mL eppendorfs using liquid nitrogen.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Centrifuge the cell lysate at 21,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and collect the soluble fraction.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0Measure protein concentration in the lysate using BCA assay.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0Distribute the lysate equally into 8 aliquots (1.1-1.2 mL each).\n7.\u00a0\u00a0Treat each pair of aliquots with vehicle, 500 \u00b5M ATP, 500 nM AKT1 or with AKT1+ATP and incubate on a thermomixer at 37\u00b0C for 30 min.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0After incubation, aliquot each replicate into 10 PCR microtubes (100 \u03bcL each) and incubate each for 3 min in the thermocycler at the corresponding temperature points of 37, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 63, and 67\u00b0C.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0Let the samples cool down for 3 min at room temperature and afterwards keep on ice.\n10.

At this stage, a cloudy solution must form.\n22.\u00a0Centrifuge the samples at 21,000 g for 10 min.

The samples can then be concatenated into as many fractions as desired (for example, for concatenation into 24 fractions as in our paper, fractions 1, 25, 49 and 73 can be combined, as well as fractions 2, 26, 50 and 74, and so on).\n43.\u00a0Dry the samples in a concentrator.\n44.\u00a0Store peptide pellets at -80\u00b0C.\nLiquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry\n45.\u00a0Dissolve the samples in buffer A (0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile in water) to an estimated 0.2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl concentration.\n46.\u00a0Prepare liquid chromatograph (Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system).

Perform reverse-phase separation using an Easy-Spray HPLC column (75 \u00b5m internal diameter, packed with PepMap C18, 2 \u00b5m beads, 100 \u00c5 pore size).\n48.\u00a0Connect the EASY-Spray column to a nanoflow Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo) and elute in an organic solvent gradient increasing from 4% to 26% (B: 98% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 2% water) at a flow rate of 300 nL min\n-1\nover 95 min.\n49.\u00a0For MS acquisition on Q Exactive HF, program the following setting in the method: Record the precursor ion spectra at the m/z range of 375-1500 with 120,000 m/z resolution, automatic gain control target of 3x10\n6\nions and maximum injection time of 100 ms.

Use the UniProt complete human proteome database for protein identification. Use Trypsin/P as enzyme specificity and do not allow for more than 2 missed cleavages. Select TMT10-plex in MS2 for peptide quantification. Set cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation as a variable modification. Include phosphorylation on serine and threonine as variable modifications and use the same settings in quantification (the last setting is important if a kinase such as AKT1 is used as an enzyme). Use a 1% false discovery rate as a filter at both protein and peptide levels. Use the \u201cMatch Between Runs\u201d option with default settings.\n51.\u00a0Analyze the \u201cProteinGroups.txt\u201d file resulting from the above search using our SIESTA package hosted on GitHub\n3\n."

SIESTA can be used for universal discovery of enzyme substrates that shift in thermal stability or solubility upon post-translational modification (PTM). Experimental design, proteomics sample preparation and data analysis are the key stages of this protocol. Data analysis can be performed using our SIESTA package hosted on GitHub <sup>3</sup>. When performed with classical thermal proteome profiling (TPP), the protocol will take 5 days for sample preparation and 14 days of sample analysis by mass spectrometry (the current protocol). If our high-throughput version of TPP called Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration assay (PISA) <sup>4</sup> is used instead, the sample analysis time by mass spectrometry is reduced to 1-2 days for the same number of conditions.</p>",
