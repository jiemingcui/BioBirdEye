            "content": "<p>In the last two decades, genetic code expansion has emerged as one of the most powerful protein engineering techniques<sup>1,2</sup>. This technology allows incorporation of unnatural (also referred to as noncanonical) amino acids, into proteins <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>. A plethora of custom-designed UAAs with chemically unique side chains have facilitated novel studies in single cells and organisms<sup>3-5</sup>. This technology also offers novel avenues for addressing complex neurobiological questions<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>In combination with bioorthogonal click chemistry, genetic code expansion can be used for direct protein labelling with small organic dyes<sup>7-10</sup>. To this aim, clickable UAAs carrying strained alkenes or alkynes, such as trans-cyclooct-2-en-lysine (TCO*-Lys), trans-cyclooct-4-en-lysine (TCO\u2212Lys), strained cyclooctyne-lysine (SCO\u2212Lys), and bicyclononyne-lysine (BCN\u2212Lys), are incorporated site-specifically into proteins of interest in response to an in-frame amber stop codon in the corresponding mRNA<sup>11-14</sup>. Site-specific UAA incorporation is achieved by amber codon suppression with the help of amber codon suppressor transfer (t)RNA and its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (RS). Proteins with UAA are subsequently labelled with fluorescent tetrazine dyes in a fast type of bioorthogonal click reaction strain-promoted inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition (SPIEDAC). This reaction is biocompatible and labelling is done in living cells. What makes this type of labelling particularly attractive is the small size of the labelling tag. Only one native amino acid is exchanged for the UAA in the protein of interest which has minimal steric and functional impact on the protein. As a consequence, dyes are brought as close as possible to the protein of interest. Compared to conventional labelling tags, such as antibodies, and self-labeling tags such as Halo-, SNAP-, CLIP-tags, direct labelling of proteins with tetrazine dyes results in a much smaller linkage error. This makes click chemistry-based protein labelling particularly relevant for super-resolution imaging<sup>8</sup>. In addition, the structure of the protein is minimally perturbed, which makes it particularly attractive for labelling of complex proteins, such as ion channels and receptors, as well as for live-cell imaging studies in general.</p><p>Until recently this type of labelling has been mainly used in conventional cell lines<sup>15</sup>. Earlier this year, we have shown that it can be used for labelling of proteins in living neurons, either under exogenous or endogenous promoters<sup>16</sup>. In parallel, others have shown that it can be applied for the labelling of transmembrane proteins in dissociated neurons and slices<sup>17,18</sup>.</p><p>Here, we describe a detailed protocol for genetic code expansion and click labelling of intracellular proteins in living neuronal cell lines and primary mouse neurons. We have used neurofilament light chain as a protein of interest, but the protocol can be adjusted for other intracellular or extracellular proteins. As our previous protocols<sup>9,19</sup> deal with the details of genetic code expansion and different click labelling approaches in conventional cell lines, here we report on the optimal and highly efficient conditions for the transfection and click labelling of intracellular proteins in neurons.&nbsp;In addition, we provide a protocol for dual-color pulse-chase click chemistry labeling of two protein populations in living and fixed primary neurons.</p>"

To ensure optimal conditions for cell growth, use cell passages 3 to 15 for these types of experiments.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culture seeded cells overnight at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO\n2\n.\nDay 1: ND7/23 cell transfection\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pre-warm Opti-MEM\u2122 I Reduced Serum Medium to 37\u00b0 C.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare transfection mix with a DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 ratio of 1 \u00b5g:2.4 \u00b5l.

Add 25 \u00b5l of the transfection mix dropwise to the culturing medium. Handle up to two Lab-Tek II chambered coverglasses at a time, to prevent the culturing medium from cooling down.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0Add 2.5 \u00b5l of TCO*A-Lys dilution in a corner of the well. Move the Lab-Tek II chambered coverglass up and down, left and right to resuspend the TCO*A-Lys. The final concentration of TCO*A-Lys is 250 \u00b5M.\n*After the addition of TCO*A-Lys dilution, the pink color of the medium will become slightly more red/orange due to the change in pH\n12.\u00a0\u00a0Incubate the cells 6 h at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO2.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0Right before the medium change, prepare a fresh dilution of TCO*A-Lys as described above (section I, step 9) and pre-warm ND7/23 cell culturing medium to 37\u00b0 C.\n14.\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the transfection mix-containing medium from cells and add 250 \u00b5l of warm ND7/23 cell culturing medium.

For example, silicon rhodamine-tetrazine (SiR-tz) dye performs well for live cell labeling of intracellular proteins, and we use it most frequently.\n20.\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the medium from cells, rinse once more with warm culturing medium and add the tetrazine-dye dilution.\n21.\u00a0\u00a0Incubate 10 min at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO\n2\n.\n22.\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the tetrazine-dye dilution from cells, rinse 2x with warm culturing medium, and then add 250 \u00b5l of culturing medium per one well of an eight-well Lab-Tek\u00a0II chamber.\n23.\u00a0\u00a0Incubate for 2-3 h at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO\n2\n.\n24.\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the medium from cells, rinse once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1.8 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4) and fix for 15 min at RT with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Wash the cells 3x5 min with PBS and keep at 4\u00b0 C until imaging or immunocytochemistry labeling.\n25.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, if cell-impermeable tetrazine-dyes are to be used for labeling, fix the cells after labeling and washing (section I, steps 16-23) with 4% PFA diluted in PB for 15 min at RT. Rinse the cells 3x with PBS and permeabilize with 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 10 min at RT. Incubate for 10 min at 37\u00b0 C with the cell-impermeable tetrazine-dye diluted to the final concentration of 0.5-2.5\u00a0\u00b5M in PBS. ATTO488-tz dye works well for labeling in fixed cells, although with a higher non-specific background staining in comparison to live cell labeling with cell-permeable dyes. Aspirate the dye, rinse 3x with PBS and incubate with PBS on a shaker at RT for 20-30 min. Keep at 4\u00b0 C until immunocytochemistry staining or microscopy.\nII.

The final transfection mix will contain 2% of B27 Plus and 1% of PS, the same as the culturing medium. Mix by pipetting and avoid making bubbles. Incubate 5 min at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO\n2\n.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0Take the neurons from the incubator, aspirate all of the culturing medium from wells and keep for use as a CM. Add 200 \u00b5l of the warm transfection mix dropwise. Add transfection mix to a maximum of 4 wells of an eight-well Lab-Tek\u00a0II chambered coverglass at a time, to prevent neurons from drying out.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0Incubate 4-6 h at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO\n2\n.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0Right before the medium change, prepare a 1:4 dilution of TCO*A-Lys in 1 M HEPES.

Wash 3x5 min with PBS and keep at 4\u00b0 C until imaging or immunocytochemistry labeling.\n26.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, replace the NB Plus + with Hibernate E medium (containing 2% B27 Plus and 1% PS) and image live cells at 37\u00b0 C for up to 5 h.\nDual-color pulse-chase bioorthogonal click chemistry labeling in neurons\nDay 10: Labeling the first NFL population with a cell-permeable tetrazine-dye in live neurons\n27.\u00a0\u00a0Two days after transfection (section II, steps 4-16), label the first population of NFL by following the protocol for single-color live click chemistry labeling of neurons that is written above (section II, steps 17-23). For dual-color labeling, we frequently used BODIPY-tz and SiR-tz as the first dye, but others such as TAMRA-tz can be used as well.\n28.\u00a0\u00a0After the labeling, incubate neurons in 1:1 mixture of CM and fresh NB Plus + for 2-3 h at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO\n2\n. Aspirate the medium, rinse once more with warm fresh NB Plus + and add a 1:1 mixture of CM and fresh NB Plus + that contains 250 \u00b5M TCO*A-Lys. Incubate for additional 2 days at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO\n2\n. Afterward, proceed with the labeling of the second population on day 12.\nDay 12: Labeling the second population of NFL with either cell-permeable tetrazine-dye in live neurons or cell-impermeable dye after fixation\n29.\u00a0\u00a0Label the second population of NFL in live neurons by following the protocol for single-color live click chemistry labeling that is written above (section II, steps 17-23).

Fix the cells or proceed to live-cell imaging as described above (section II, step 26).\n30.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, fix the cells with 4% PFA diluted in PEM buffer for 15 min at RT and rinse 3x with PBS. Permeabilize the cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 10 min at RT. Incubate for 10min at 37\u00b0 C with the cell-impermeable tetrazine-dye diluted to the final concentration of 0.5-2.5\u00a0\u00b5M in PBS. For the second population labeling after fixation, we used cell-impermeable ATTO488-tz. Aspirate the dye, rinse 3x with PBS and incubate with PBS on a shaker at RT for 20-30 min. Keep at 4\u00b0 C until immunocytochemistry staining or microscopy."

Labelling tags should be small and ideally compatible with live-cell imaging. An elegant protein labelling technique that fulfils these criteria is based on genetic code expansion and bioorthogonal click chemistry. Genetic code expansion allows incorporation of clickable UAAs into proteins of interest which are subsequently directly labelled with small fluorescent dyes using click chemistry. While previous work has mainly focused on easy-to-transfect standard cell lines, recent publications have described applications of this technology in primary neurons. Here, we report a detailed protocol for transfections and bioorthogonal click chemistry-based labelling of intracellular proteins in living primary neurons. </p>",
