            "content": "Mitochondria are highly dynamic, energy-generating organelles in eukaryotic cells and play a vital role in fundamental cellular processes such as calcium homeostasis, metabolite synthesis and apoptosis<sup>1</sup>. Mitochondrial function impinges on several signaling pathways modulating cellular metabolism, cell survival and healthspan. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction is considered as one of the major hallmarks of several pathological conditions and ageing, underlining the significance of proper mitochondrial function<sup>2</sup>. Maintenance of cellular and organismal homeostasis necessitates a tight regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as, the elimination of damaged or superfluous mitochondria<sup>3-6</sup>. Thus, eukaryotic organisms have developed complex and highly specialized molecular and cellular pathways to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis<sup>7</sup>. Mitophagy is a selective type of autophagy mediating elimination of dysfunctional or aged mitochondria, and the major degradation pathway, by which cells regulate mitochondrial population in response to metabolic state<sup>8</sup>.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDespite the advances in the delineation of molecular mechanisms that regulate mitophagy, there are no reliable and quantitative, _in vivo_ approaches for monitoring mitochondrial elimination in multicellular organisms. We developed two composite systems for monitoring mitophagy _in vivo_ and identified conditions that either induce or suppress mitophagy in the nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_. We generated transgenic animals expressing the Rosella biosensor, in mitochondria. Rosella is a purpose-built reporter comprising a fast-maturing pH-insensitive DsRed fused to a pH-sensitive GFP variant. This biosensor has been successfully used in previous studies to monitor mitophagy in the unicellular organism _Saccharomyces cerevisiae<sup>9</sup>_. We adapted this versatile fluorescent microscopy assay and examined _C. elegans_ animals carrying mtRosella, under normal and mitophagy-inducing conditions such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial stress and heat stress. All treatments reduce the GFP/DsRed ratio of Rosella fluorescence, indicating stimulation of mitophagy. In addition to mtRosella, we generated transgenic animals expressing a mitochondria-targeted GFP, together with the autophagosomal marker LGG-1, the homologue of the mammalian cytosolic microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 \\(MAP1LC3/LC3), fused with DsRed in body wall muscle cells. We examined animals carrying both the mitochondrial and autophagosomal markers, under normal and mitophagy-inducing conditions. Mitophagy stimulation induces the formation of autophagosomes that extensively co-localize with mitochondria.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe availability of reliable and quantitative methods for monitoring mitochondrial elimination is a prerequisite for shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of mitophagy in living cells and organisms. Delineating the role of mitophagy at the organismal level is pivotal for the development of therapeutic interventions to treat several human pathologies including neurodegenerative disorders. In the following sections, we describe detailed protocols for _in vivo_ imaging of mitochondrial-selective autophagy in _C. elegans_, using two versatile imaging tools."

DCT-1 deficient animals failed to remove damaged mitochondria in response to stress. Additionally, DCT-1 acts downstream of PINK1/Parkin pathway mediating mitophagy and preserving mitochondrial and organismal homeostasis."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a shared hallmark of many human pathologies and ageing. Mitochondrial selective autophagy mediates the removal of damaged or superfluous mitochondria preserving mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis. Deregulation of mitophagy is associated with the onset of several pathological conditions including ageing and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_ is a widely used model organism for studying the biology of ageing and neurodegeneration. Here, we describe tools and resources for monitoring mitophagy in _C. elegans_. We developed two composite, in vivo mitophagy imaging systems based, first, on the Rosella biosensor, which combines a fast-maturing pH-insensitive DsRed fused to a pH-sensitive GFP variant, and second, on a custom, dual-fluorescence reporter system that utilizes a mitochondria-targeted GFP, together with the autophagosomal marker LGG-1/LC3 fused to DsRed. We validated both systems in various cell types and under conditions known to induce mitophagy in the worm. These protocols facilitate non-invasive monitoring of mitophagy in physiologically-relevant contexts.",
