            "content": "<p>Mesoderm, one of the three principal germ layers is formed and specified in the primitive streak (PS) during early embryonic development. The primitive streak is the anatomical correlate of gastrulation, a process during which the pluripotent cells of the epiblast undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and give rise to mesoderm and definitive endoderm. Paraxial or presomitic mesoderm is one the mesodermal lineages which are formed and specified along the anterior-posterior axis of the primitive streak.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During somitogenesis these presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells then give rise to somites, transiently epithelialized balls of somitic mesoderm (SM), which further differentiate into the two major somite compartments, sclerotome (SCL) and dermomyotome (DM) respectively. Somitic mesoderm and its derivatives contribute to the formation and patterning of the musculoskeletal system, giving rise to vertebrae, ribs and skeletal muscle. This entire process has been extensively studied using model organisms such as chick, mouse or zebrafish but remains largely elusive in the human context. This also applies to studies focusing on the segmentation clock, a species-specific molecular oscillator believed to control the process of somitogenesis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to gain insights into human somitogenesis, we and others have recently established induction protocols and approaches for the reproducible&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>derivation of presomitic and somitic mesoderm-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells<sup>1-6</sup>. Molecular and functional analysis of these&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>derived human presomitic and somitic mesoderm-like cells and their derivatives have increased our understanding of this core developmental process in human.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Nature Protocol Exchange is an addition to our recent paper on the&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>recapitulation of the human segmentation clock from pluripotent stem cells, and describes in detail the stepwise induction of presomitic and somitic mesoderm and its derivatives from human iPSCs.&nbsp;</p>"

            "content": "1) Human iPSC culture (feeder-free)\nThe here described induction and differentiation conditions are based on the feeder-free attachment (2D) culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 201B7\n7\nand 1231A3\n8\non laminin-coated (iMatrix-511 silk, Nippi) sterile cell culture dishes with StemFit\n\u00ae\nAK02N (Reprocell) being the iPSC-culture and maintenance medium of choice. Stable culture of fully reprogramed high-quality human iPSCs is necessary for subsequent successful differentiation steps and efficient induction of mesodermal cell types described in this protocol exchange. The here defined culture and differentiation conditions are compatible with and can be applied to other high-quality human iPSC-lines (e.g. 428C2)\n9\n. Please note that for human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and pluripotent stem cells of other species culture conditions may need to be optimized.\nThe here exemplified culture and differentiation conditions are for single-cell dissociation and culture of human iPSCs in a laminin-coated 6 well culture plate. Please adjust initial seeding densities and volumes of culture (maintenance) media according to the sterile cell culture plates and dishes utilized for initial feeder-free iPSC culture (see Table 1 for details).\n1.1 Coating of cell culture dishes & plates for feeder-free iPSC culture\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Described conditions are for a sterile 6 well culture plate but can be adjusted to other culture plates and dishes accordingly. (see Table 1 for details)\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 1.5 ml of PBS containing iMatrix-511 silk (0.5 \u00b5g/cm\n2\n) into each well of a 6 well sterile culture plate. Other Laminin-511 fragment sources/types such as iMatrix-511 (Nippi, Cat# 892012) can be also used.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubate the plate with coating agent either for >1 hour at 37\u00b0C, for >3 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C. Usually coating is performed overnight at 4\u00b0C.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 750 \u00b5l (or half the volume of initial iMatrix-511 solution) of StemFit\n\u00ae\nAK02N and mix thoroughly.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the medium and add 1.5 ml of StemFit\n\u00ae\nAK02N containing Y-27632 (10 \u00b5M). Place plate into humidified CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C. Do not let the plate dry out when changing solutions.\n1.2 Passaging of human feeder-free iPSCs\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare ~ 80% confluent culture of human feeder-free iPSCs.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the culture medium.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash the iPS cell colonies with PBS.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 300 \u00b5l of 0.5x TrypLE\nTM\nSelect enzyme solution (diluted with 0.5 mmol/l-EDTA/PBS); distribute it evenly, and put the plate into a humidified CO\n2\nincubator set to 37\u00b0C.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After 1 minute, take out the plate and re-distribute TrypLE\nTM\nSelect enzyme solution and put it back into the incubator (for another 3 minutes).\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take out the plate and observe the cells under the microscope whether they have started separating/detaching; if not, incubate for another 30 seconds to 1 minute.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the solution and wash with PBS gently.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate PBS and add 1 ml of StemFit\n\u00ae\nAK02N with Y-27632 (10 \u00b5M).\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Harvest cells with cell scraper into a 1.5 ml microtube.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0Dissociate the collected cells gently by pipetting up and down ~ 10 times (using 1,000 \u00b5l tip) and measure cell density.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0Seed 1.3x10\n4\ncells/well onto iMatrix-511 silk-coated 6 well culture plate containing pre-warmed medium (for other plates or dishes see Table 1).\n12.\u00a0\u00a0Distribute cells evenly by gentle shaking and incubate plate with cells in humidified CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0On the next day, change the medium to StemFit\n\u00ae\nAK02N without Y-27632.\n14.\u00a0\u00a0Change medium every other day unless the medium color turns yellow or iPSCs start to prematurely differentiate; if so, change the medium every day.\n15.\u00a0\u00a0Passage once every week.\n1.3 Preparing freezing stocks of feeder-free iPSCs\nInitial steps are same with the procedure for passaging until step 10.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer the required number of cells collected from the culture plate or dish into a 1.5 ml microtube and centrifuge (800 rpm, 22\u00b0C, 5 minutes).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells with Stem-cellbanker (Takara) (1.0x10\n6\ncells/ml).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 200 \u00b5l of cell suspension (2.0x10\n5\ncells) into cryogenic tube (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Freeze vials in\u00a0pre-cooled freezing container\u00a0at -80\u00b0C for overnight.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the next day, transfer frozen vials into a liquid nitrogen tank.\n1.4 Thawing and culture of frozen feeder-free iPSC stocks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Set water bath to 37\u00b0C.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 5 ml of StemFit\n\u00ae\nAK02N with Y-27632 (10 \u00b5M) into a 15 ml tube.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thaw a frozen vial of iPSCs in the water bath until only a few small ice particles remain.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer the cells into a 15 ml tube and centrifuge (800 rpm, 22\u00b0C, 5 minutes).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the supernatant and add 500 \u00b5l of StemFit\n\u00ae\nAK02N with Y-27632.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissociate the cells gently by pipetting (about 10 times) and measure the cell density using hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seed 1.3x10\n4\nsingle cells/well onto laminin-coated 6 well culture plate. Make sure that viability of cells is high and seed\u00a0appropriate number of living cells\u00a0into utilized culture plates or dishes.\n2) Stepwise induction of human somitic mesoderm and its major derivatives\nFeeder-free cultured human iPSCs are utilized for stepwise somitic mesoderm induction at day 5 post single-cell dissociation and culture. Human iPSC colonies should be clearly visible and the condition of cells should be excellent without presence of prematurely differentiating cells in the culture. For all here described differentiation and induction conditions of human somitic mesoderm and its derivatives a chemically defined medium (CDM)\n10\nis used as base medium. Composition of the utilized CDM is described in Table 2. All growth factors and small molecules necessary at each induction step should be added to CDM just before use of media. A master mix of the required induction media can be made and distributed into each well/dish as needed. Exemplified induction protocols are based on culture of human iPSCs in a 6 well sterile culture plate. Necessary minimal media volumes for different plates or dishes are described in Table 3. Our stepwise somitic mesoderm induction protocol is similar to a recent published protocol, albeit with some differences\n4\n.\n2.1 Preparation of Chemically Defined Medium (CDM)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perform all described steps under a clean-bench; use sterile tips and bottles (see Table 2 for composition of CDM).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissolve bovine serum albumin (BSA) (10 mg/ml) in Ham\u2019s F-12 Nutrient Mix (F12) and add Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S) (100 unit/100 \u00b5g/ml).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pass dissolved mixture through filter bottle (0.22 \u00b5m).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mix filtered BSA and P/S containing F12 medium with IMDM (1:1).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add sterile reconstituted Apo-transferrin (15 \u00b5g/ml), 1-Thioglycerol (450 \u00b5M), CD Lipid (1%) and rh-Insulin (7 \u00b5g/ml) and store at 4\u00b0C until use. Concentrations given in brackets are the\u00a0final concentrations at the time of adding components. CDM should be used up within two weeks.\n2.2 Primitive Streak (PS) induction\nPS cells are induced via activation of FGF, WNT and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways in human feeder-free cultured iPSCs. Adjust induction media volumes to utilized type of dishes or plates (Table 3).\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare PS induction medium by adding CHIR99021 (10 \u00b5M), rh-Activin A (50 ng/ml) and rh-bFGF (20 ng/ml) to CDM. See Table 4 for details. Usually a master mix of the required induction medium is made and distributed into each well or dish as needed to reduce pipetting errors and well-to-well variability.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prior to induction of PS cells, iPSCs are cultured in humidified CO\n2\nincubator on laminin-coated plates for 5 days from initial seeding of iPSCs at single cell level. At time of induction clear epithelial colonies of iPSCs have formed and are visible under the microscope. If iPSC conditions are not good (e.g. many spontaneously differentiated cells are present or colony sizes/shapes are unusual) do not use cells for induction.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate the maintenance medium (StemFit\n\u00ae\nAK02N).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 2 ml of PS induction medium into each well (for volume of induction medium to be added when using other plates or dishes see Table 3).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culture iPSCs in PS induction medium at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours in humidified CO\n2\nincubator.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use induced PS cells for subsequent differentiation into human presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells; use PS cells for characterization and quality control (i.e. RNA and protein isolation, immunocytochemistry, FACS and quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) etc.).\n2.3 Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM) induction\nPSM cells are induced from human iPSC-derived primitive streak (PS) cells (for details on how to induce PS cells see 2.2). Our PSM induction protocol is similar to a recent published protocol, albeit with some differences\n4\n. Other protocols aiming to induce presomitic mesoderm from human pluripotent stem cells (hESCs or hiPSCs) have also been reported\n2,3,5,6\n. Following the 24 hours of initial PS induction, induce PSM cells by simultaneous activation of WNT and FGF signaling and inhibition of TGF\u03b2 and BMP signaling pathways.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prepare PSM induction medium by adding CHIR99021 (3 \u00b5M), LDN193189 (250 nM), rh-bFGF (20 ng/ml) and SB431542 (10 \u00b5M) to CDM. See Table 5 for details on components of the PSM induction medium. Usually a master mix of the required induction medium is made and distributed into each well or dish as needed to reduce pipetting errors and well-to-well variability.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aspirate previous (PS) induction medium.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Add 2 ml of freshly made PSM induction medium.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culture cells in humidified CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use induced PSM cells for subsequent differentiation into human somitic mesoderm (SM) cells or analysis of\nin vitro\nfeatures of induced PSM cells including e.g. oscillatory expression of segmentation clock genes. For details on measurement and visualization of oscillatory expression of segmentation clock genes in\nin vitro\ninduced human PSM cells see our concurrent paper in Nature and related recent papers by other groups\n2\n. In case of bioluminescent measurement of oscillatory gene activity,\nin vitro\ninduced PSM cells derived from a luciferase-reporter line of e.g. human\nHES7\nare cultured in CDM-based PSM medium containing D-luciferin (BMS). The presence of bioluminescent activity is measured using a luminometer set-up which allows extended culture of PSM cells\nin vitro\n(Atto). The here described PSM induction approach can also be used to measure and visualize oscillatory activity in other human and non-human pluripotent stem cells, but may require further adjustments and optimization of the culture conditions e.g. adjustment of the level of WNT activity during\nin vitro\nculture. Other human\nin vitro\nPSM induction protocols can also be used to characterize aspects of the\nin vitro\nhuman segmentation clock\n2,11\n. Already described in our concurrent paper\n1\n, stepwise\nin vitro\ninduced PSM cells can be utilized for further molecular characterization and functional analysis as well as quality control e.g. RNA and protein isolation, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometric (FACS) analysis and quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR).

Pluripotent stem cell-based&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>approaches aiming to recapitulate distinct aspects of this core developmental process have recently been reported, including our recent paper on the&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>recapitulation of the human segmentation clock<sup>1</sup>. Here we describe in detail our stepwise induction protocol of presomitic mesoderm (PSM), somitic mesoderm (SM), and its two major derivatives, sclerotome (SCL) and dermomyotome (DM) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We further briefly address the subsequent molecular and functional analysis of these&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>induced human mesodermal lineages and cell-types.&nbsp;</p>",
