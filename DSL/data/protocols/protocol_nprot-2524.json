            "content": "Metabolomics is one of the most rapidly advancing analytical approaches that aim at the comprehensive analysis of a large numbers of metabolites. It is most extensively utilized method in the field of plant sciences, since plants possess the unique feature of synthesizing a large number of natural products that do not exist in any other life form. Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry \\(GC\u2013MS) is one of the most important and robust tools of metabolomics<sup>1</sup>. This technology has high separation efficiency that can not only resolve complex volatile mixtures \\(alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes etc.) but also non-volatile metabolites through the chemical derivatization. Common derivatization procedures include trimethylsilylation and the reaction with diazomethane<sup>2, 3, 4</sup>. It can be applied for global biochemical profiling for better understanding of metabolic events in biological systems<sup>5, 6, 7</sup>.\r\n\n\nTomato is a highly interesting system to study maturation and ripening processes because of the dramatic metabolic changes that occur during development. These metabolic events have been studied in detail in the past<sup>8, 9</sup>. Tomato fruit at different developmental stages can be distinguished on the basis of their metabolic complement<sup>10</sup>. GC-MS has been used to characterize tomato pericarp composition in transgenic plants<sup>11</sup>, to assess metabolic diversity of tomato species<sup>12</sup> and to measure metabolic changes associated with tomato fruit development<sup>10</sup> and to characterize biochemical changes during the development, ripening and post-harvest shelf-life of tomato fruit, covering both the pre- and post-harvest phases<sup>13</sup>.Cuticular wax composition of wild type and lecer6 mutant tomato was also compared using this approach<sup>14</sup>. We describe herein a detailed protocol for extraction, derivatization, identification and quantification of lipohilic metabolites from leaves and fruit tissue of tomato."

            "content": "**Harvesting of plant tissue  \\(leaves or fruits)**\r\n\n\n1) Harvest the tissue \\(500mg-1.0g) from plant under the desired experimental condition.\r\n\n\n2) Immediately freeze the tissue by immersing in liquid nitrogen.\r\n\n\n3)  Frozen tissues can be freeze dried. Lyophilized tissue can be stored at -80\u00b0C for several weeks or processed immediately.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n **Organic extraction**\r\n\n\n1) Transfer a known amount of lyophilized tissue, typically 300-500mg in a glass vial with cap.\r\n\n\n2) Add 10\u00b5l of internal standard 5\u03b1 -cholest 7en-3\u03b2-ol \\(1mg/ml stock) to the vial. \r\n\n\n3) Add 3.75ml of CHCl3: methanol \\(1:2) and vortex vigorously. \r\n\n\n4) Add 1.25 ml of CHCl3 and vortex well. \r\n\n\n5) Add 1.25 ml of dH2O and vortex once again. \r\n\n\n6) Transfer bottom organic phase to a fresh vial with the help of a pipette. The solvent should be allowed to evaporate completely at 35\u2070C.\r\n\n\n**Critical step**: Weighing of the tissue should be done immediately to avoid thawing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Alkaline hydrolysis**\r\n\n\n1) Add 500 \u00b5l of 6% methanolic KOH \\(w/v) to the dried residue and incubate at 85\u2070C for \u00bd -1 hrs. \r\n\n\n2) To it, add half the volume i.e. 250 \u00b5l of dH2O and then equal volume i.e. 750 \u00b5l of n-heptane and vortex well. \r\n\n\n3) Allow it to stand for sometimes till the layers get separated. Transfer upper phase to a fresh vial. Repeat the above step twice.\r\n\n\n4) Allow heptane to evaporate completely \\(16- 24hrs).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Derivatization**\r\n\n\nTo the dried residue, add 100 \u00b5l of derivatization reagent \\(80 \u00b5l BFSTA+20 \u00b5l TMCS) and incubate at 65\u2070C for 1 hrs and inject in to GC-MS.\r\n\n\n**Critical step**: The most critical point is to avoid any water or moisture during derivatization especially the silylating step is highly vulnerable. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**GC-MS analysis**\r\n\n\nFor GC-MS analysis 1\u00b5l of the sample is injected in split mode in the instrument. Use a Rtx5MS- 30m column with 0.25-mm ID and 0.25\u00b5m df. Following are the parameters standardized for GC-MS run:\r\n\n\n\u2022 Injection temperature: 300\u00b0C,\r\n\n\n\u2022 Interface temperature: 300\u00b0C, \r\n\n\n\u2022 Ion source should be adjusted to 250\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Carrier gas: Helium \\(flow rate of 1 ml min-1).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Perform the analysis using the following temperature program:\r\n\n\n1 min. of isothermal heating at 100\u2070C followed by heating at 300\u2070C for 20 mins.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Mass spectra were recorded at 2 scan sec-1 with a scanning range of 40 to 850 m/z. Quantify each component based on peak areas and normalization based on the internal standard."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Gas chromatography- mass spectrometry \\(GC-MS) is a highly used and well established technological platform for metabolite profiling in both plant and non-plant species. Here we describe a simple protocol for lipophilic compounds extraction and analysis from tomato fruits and leaves which is an important crop in terms of its economic and nutritional value. This is a rapid, reliable and reproducible method to detect and quantify lipophilic metabolites including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, sterols, alkanes, alkenes, and triterpenoids by GC-MS. In addition, this is a simple and convenient method for efficient comparative lipid profiling of wild type and transgenic or mutant tomato fruits.",
