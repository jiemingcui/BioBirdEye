            "content": "Human embryonic stem cells \\(hESCs) self-renew indefinitely while retaining the capacity for multilineage differentiation, providing a valuable tool for basic research and potential therapeutic applications. Conventional hESC culture conditions include Activin A and basic FGF \\(abbreviated as A/F) and capture pluripotent cells in a developmentally advanced or \u201cprimed\u201d pluripotent state that resembles the postimplantation epiblast<sup>1, 2</sup>. In addition, several laboratories have recently developed protocols to capture pluripotent cells in a more primitive or \u201cna\u00efve\u201d state that resemble the preimplantation epiblast<sup>3-5</sup>. For example, na\u00efve stem cells upregulate gene expression programs associated with cleavage stage embryos, show global DNA hypomethylation and a lack of X chromosome inactivation<sup>6, 7</sup>, offering a useful system to study transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of preimplantation development. In addition, na\u00efve hESCs are reportedly more efficient at producing certain specialized cell types, such as primordial germ cells<sup>8</sup>. Culture conditions to convert primed hESCs to a na\u00efve state typically rely on a combination of growth factors and small molecules that suppress specific protein kinases involved in differentiation, cell adhesion, and survival<sup>3-5</sup>. Two culture methods appear to be particularly effective in endowing primed hESCs with a na\u00efve-like transcriptional state<sup>9</sup>. The first protocol, termed \u201ct2iLG\u00f6Y\u201d, involves transient overexpression of the transcription factors KLF2 and NANOG in the presence of the MEK inhibitor \\(MEKi) PD0325901 and titrated amounts of GSK3B inhibitor \\(CHIR99021), supplemented with the PKC inhibitor G\u00f66983 and human LIF \\(hLIF)<sup>4, 10</sup>. The second protocol, termed \u201c5i/LAF\u201d, requires treatment of primed hESCs with inhibitors targeting the GSK3B, ROCK, BRAF, MEK, and SRC kinases in addition to hLIF and A/F<sup>5, 7</sup>. Despite differences in media components, inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase \\(MAPK/ERK) pathway are common to all currently available protocols.\r\n\n\nWe uncovered an unexpected sensitivity of na\u00efve hESCs to MAPK signal inhibition, which affects their optimal proliferation rate, survival and genome integrity. We thus propose that minimal MAPK activity is beneficial to preserve both a robust growth potential and genomic stability in na\u00efve human pluripotent stem cells maintained in 5i/LAF. Our data also suggest that different hESC lines respond differently to MEK inhibition. Thus, we suggest that MEK inhibitors should ideally be titrated in a cell line dependent fashion."

Conventional primed human ESCs \\(WIBR3 cell line, DPE-OCT4GFP\n5\n, UCLA1, UCLA3, UCLA4, UCLA5, UCLA9 and UCLA17 cell lines) are maintained in a feeder-free TeSR-E8 medium and passaged every 4-5 days at 1:4 ratio.\r\n  2. Before passaging, coat culture wells with Matrigel \\(Corning) for 30 minutes at 37C.\r\n  3. For passaging, wash primed hESCs with PBS \\(Life Technologies) and then add Versene solution \\(Life Technologies) for ~5 minutes. Aspirate the Versene solution, wash with PBS \\(Life Technologies), add fresh TeSR-E8 \\(Stem Cell Technologies) and break the colonies into small clumps by gently pipetting. 10 \u03bcM Y- 27632 \\(Axon Medchem) can be added to the TeSR-E8 media to improve hESC survival rate.\r\n  4. Cells are cultured in a 37C, 5% O2 and 5% CO2 incubator and media are changed every day. NOTE: Primed hESCs are frozen in mFreSR medium \\(Stem Cell Technologies) following the manufacturer instructions.\r\n  \r\n\n\n_Conversion of primed hESCs to a naive state_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_5i/LAF culture condition:_\r\n\n\n1. For conversion of primed hESCs to a na\u00efve state, irradiated CF-1 MEFs \\(2.5x10\n6\ncells per 9.5 cm2) are plated the day before in MEF medium on Matrigel coated dishes.\r\n  2. Primed hESCs are treated with TrypLE expressed enzyme for 3-5 minutes, dissociated into a single-cell suspension and plated at a density of 30.000 cells per 9.5cm2 on irradiated CF-1 MEFs in TeSR-E8 medium supplemented with 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 \\(Axon Medchem). \r\n  3. The medium is replaced the day after with fresh TeSR-E8.\r\n  4. Two days after passaging, medium is changed to 5i/LAF and then replaced daily.\r\n  5. After 8-10 days naive-like hESCs are passaged onto a fresh layer of irradiated CF-1 MEFs at a 1:1-1:2 ratio. Dome-shaped colonies usually arise after 2-3 passages.\r\n  6. Naive hESCs are passaged every 6-7 days. For passaging, naive hESCs are treated with Accutase \\(Life technologies) for five minutes at 37C, dissociated into a single-cell suspension and resuspended in MEF medium. Cells are then filtered through a cell strainer \\(40 \u03bcM, Corning), centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and seeded on fresh irradiated MEFs in 5i/LAF medium.\r\n  \r\n\n\n_m5i/LAF culture condition:_\r\n\n\n1. For conversion of primed hESCs to a na\u00efve state, irradiated CF-1 MEFs \\(2.5x10\n6\ncells per 9.5 cm2) are plated the day before in MEF medium on Matrigel coated dishes.\r\n  2. Primed hESCs are treated with TrypLE expressed enzyme, dissociated into a single-cell suspension and plated at a density of 30.000 cells per 9.5cm2 on irradiated CF-1 MEFs in TeSR-E8 medium supplemented with 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 \\(Axon Medchem). \r\n  3. The medium is replaced the day after with fresh TeSR-E8.\r\n  4. Two days after passaging, medium is changed to m5i/LAF and then replaced daily.\r\n  5. After 8-10 days naive-like hESCs are passaged onto a fresh layer of irradiated CF-1 MEFs at a 1:1-1:2 ratio. Dome-shaped colonies usually arise after 3-5 passages.\r\n  NOTE: for some primed hESCs \\(i.e. UCLA1, UCLA9, UCLA17), the na\u00efve conversion can be very inefficient in m5i/LAF medium. For this reason, it may be necessary to pick individual colonies to expand a homogenous population of na\u00efve cells. We also note that the use of bFGF for expansion in m5i/LAF condition is not recommended.\r\n\n\n6. Naive hESCs are passaged every 6-7 days. For passaging, hESCs are treated with Accutase \\(Life technologies) for five minutes at 37C, dissociated into a single-cell suspension and resuspended in MEF medium. Cells are then filtered through a cell strainer \\(40 \u03bcM, Corning), centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and seeded on fresh irradiated MEFs in m5i/LAF medium.\r\n  NOTE: The PD03 concentration for the m5i/LAF medium may vary depending on the starting cell line. Thus, we recommend doing a titration of PD03 for each individual hESC line.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_4i/LAF with Alternative MEKi:_\r\n\n\n1. For conversion of primed hESCs to a na\u00efve state, irradiated CF-1 MEFs \\(2.5x106 cells per 9.5 cm2) are plated the day before in MEF medium on Matrigel coated dishes.\r\n  2. hESCs are treated with TrypLE expressed enzyme, dissociated into a single-cell suspension and plated at a density of 30.000 cells per 9.5cm2 on irradiated CF-1 MEFs in TeSR-E8 medium supplemented with 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 \\(Axon Medchem). \r\n  3. The medium is replaced the day after with fresh TeSR-E8.\r\n  4. Two days after passaging, medium is changed to 4i/LAF supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcM of one of the alternative MEK inhibitors and then replaced daily.\r\n  5. Cells are passaged onto a fresh layer of irradiated CF-1 MEFs at a 1:1-1:2 ratio. Dome-shaped colonies usually arise after 3-5 passages.\r\n  6. Naive hESCs are passaged every 6-7 days. For passaging, hESCs are treated with Accutase \\(Stem cell technologies) for five minutes at 37C, dissociated into a single-cell suspension and resuspended in MEF medium. Cells are then filtered through a cell strainer \\(40 \u03bcM, Corning), centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and seeded on fresh irradiated MEFs in 4i/LAF medium supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcM of one of the alternative MEK inhibitors.\r\n  \r\n\n\n_5i/LAF to m5i/LAF transition:_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Some primed hESC lines can be resistant to na\u00efve conversion in m5i/LAF conditions \\(i.e. UCLA3).  In these cases, cells are converted in 5i/LAF medium and then switched to m5i/LAF medium after 5-6 passages in culture.\r\n  2. Cells at P5 in 5i/LAF medium are passaged onto a fresh layer of irradiated CF-1 MEFs at a 1:3. \r\n  3. The day after the cells are switched to m5i/LAF medium and passaged onto a fresh layer of irradiated CF-1 MEFs at a 1:2-1:3 ratio every 6-7 days.\r\n  4. For passaging, hESCs are treated with Accutase \\(Life technologies) for five minutes at 37C, dissociated into a single-cell suspension and resuspended in MEF medium. Cells are then filtered through a cell strainer \\(40 \u03bcM, Corning), centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and seeded on fresh irradiated MEFs in m5i/LAF medium.\r\n  \r\n\n\n_5i/LAF to t2iLG\u00f6Y transition:_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. For conversion of 5i/LAF adapted na\u00efve cells in t2iLG\u00f6Y conditions, naive hESCs grown in 5i/LAF medium at P>8 are passaged onto a fresh layer of irradiated CF-1 MEFs.\r\n  2. The day after the cells are switched to t2iLG\u00f6Y medium and passaged onto a fresh layer of irradiated CF-1 MEFs at a 1:3 ratio every 6-7 days.\r\n  3. For passaging, hESCs are treated with Accutase \\(Life technologies) for five minutes at 37C, dissociated into a single-cell suspension and resuspended in MEF medium. Cells are then filtered through a cell strainer \\(40 mM, Corning), centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and seeded on fresh irradiated MEF in t2iLG\u00f6Y medium.\r\n  4. NOTE: we have expanded the hESC in t2iLG\u00f6Y for at least 4 passages. In addition, some hESC lines \\(i.e. UCLA17, UCLA3) cannot be adapted to the t2iLG\u00f6Y while maintaining na\u00efve pluripotency."
