            "content": "An assay capable of specifically identifying, measuring, and differentiating between kinases\u2019 phospho-catalytic activities in cell or tissue extracts would be valuable to life sciences and medicine. Among many valuable applications, such biotechnological advance could help improve our ability to explore signaling pathways, discover mechanism of disease, identify drug targets, assess drug responses, help drug repositioning, tailor drug combinations, develop diagnostic signatures, or guide therapeutic decisions. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSo far, the proteomic detection systems used to study extracts from biological samples rely on phosphorylatable regions of proteins to measure the phosphorylation state of proteins to then infer the functional state of kinases, without directly measuring the enzymatic activity of kinases. The two main methods are antibody-based assays1-4 and mass spectrometry techniques5-16, which allow to detect and measure \\(phospho-)protein levels. Importantly, these indirect approaches are also further restricted owing \\(i) antibodies \\(un)availability and their variable levels of specificity/sensitivity, and \\(ii) mass spectrometry cost, equipment, protocol, and complex operational or analytical requirements, which many laboratories can not achieve or sustain, or can be highly limiting for very large scale projects or not possible for clinical applications. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAlternatively, the phospho-catalytic activity of kinase enzymes can be directly measured with biochemical assays using generic amino-acid sequences that serve as individual assay-probes. This includes radioactive-labeling assays, microfluidic electrophoresis systems, ATP-consumption tests, hybrid peptide/phospho-antibody platforms, or SPR and FRET techniques17-24. Besides the challenging scalability and clinical translatability of these biochemical assays, their main drawback is that virtually every peptide they rely on are broad-spectrum, consensus, multi-kinase sensors that are originally designed for one-probe-to-many-kinases detection methods. As an analogy, this is somewhat the technical equivalent of trying to measure gene expression with only one cDNA probe per gene, or even try to use a degenerate common primer/sequence shared between multiple genes and then attempt to identify which one of these various genes is more or less expressed: this is definitively and demonstrably not how gene expression arrays work, and this is likely not how a kinase enzyme activity profiling assay should be designed in order to identify, measure, and differentiate between individual kinases\u2019 phospho-catalytic activities in cell or tissue extracts. Thus, as much as these biochemical approaches are powerful tools that are very well adapted to the requirements of pharmacological drug screens that use purified recombinant kinases to test extensive drug-compound libraries, these approaches and their readouts are by design not intended to specifically identify or differentiate between kinases\u2019 activities in complex biological extracts. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nConsidering both the unique advantages and limitations of currently available phospho-proteomic and kinase-activity profiling tools, we devised a new biotechnological platform to distinguish, identify, and measure the phospho-catalytic activity of many kinases in parallel. Our strategy relies on collections of peptide probes that are derived from the biological target sites of kinases 25,26, and are physically/biochemically used as distinct combinatorial sets of sensors to monitor the activity of kinases in samples. The technology is modular by design: users can adapt probe libraries and assay conditions to their needs. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn the below protocol, which is related to the Nature Cell Biology manuscript NCB-C36710 titled: \"Mapping phospho-catalytic dependencies of therapy-resistant tumors reveals actionable vulnerabilities\", we focus on describing the step-by-step biochemical assay. Owing the complexity \\(and user-dependent adaptability) of our strategy, the step-by-step analysis of the phospho-catalytic profiles is provided in a separate protocol."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Mapping the phospho-catalytic profile of kinase enzymes in cells or tissues remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a practical biochemical assay to measure the enzymatic activity of kinases using peptides as surrogate sensors to identify kinases in tumor biopsies and cell lines. The platform relies on collections of peptide probes that are derived from biological target sites of kinases, and that operate as distinct combinatorial peptide sets to simultaneously distinguish and measure the phospho-catalytic activity of many kinase enzymes. The assay is modular by design: users can adapt probe libraries and assay conditions to their needs. We named this functional proteomic platform 'High-Throughput Kinase Activity Mapping \\(HT-KAM) system'. The procedure described in this Protocol Exchange chapter focuses on detailing the biochemical assay, and is related to the Nature Cell Biology manuscript NCB-C36710 titled: \"Mapping phospho-catalytic dependencies of therapy-resistant tumors reveals actionable vulnerabilities\".",
