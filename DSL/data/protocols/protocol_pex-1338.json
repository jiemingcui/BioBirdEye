            "content": "<p>Since the identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sup>1</sup>, thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced worldwide and the sequences have been made publicly available on the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID)<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"https://www.gisaid.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gisaid.org/</a>). This has enabled a phylogenetic reconstruction of the viral spread and evolution across different countries and continents at an unprecedented scale<sup>3</sup>, allowing the rapid identification of new viral variants, including the UK<sup>4</sup>, South African<sup>5</sup> and Brazilian<sup>6</sup> variants of concern (VOC). SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing (WGS) based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used for genomic surveillance to track infections in hospitals and community settings<sup>7,8</sup>, as well as to monitor viral outbreaks in breeding farms, such as mink farms<sup>9</sup>. More recently, with the advent of mass-scale vaccination campaigns worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance has become vital to rapidly trace the emergence and spread of VOC with potentially reduced susceptibility to the current vaccines<sup>10,11</sup>.&nbsp;In this context, the availability of scalable and cost-effective methods for centralized sequencing of hundreds or potentially thousands of samples per week would be greatly beneficial. Various NGS based approaches have been developed to perform SARS-CoV-2 WGS using different sequencing platforms. These include direct RNA sequencing and metagenomics<sup>12\u201314</sup>, amplicon-based methods<sup>13,15,16</sup>, and oligonucleotide capture-based methods<sup>13,16\u201318</sup>. Recently, numerous commercial kits based on the above methods have become available on the market and are being deployed in SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance<sup>19</sup>. However, existing commercial solutions are very costly and/or difficult to scale up largely because, typically, one sequencing library must be prepared for each individual sample and multiple indexed libraries must be carefully quantified and balanced before pooling them together prior to sequencing. This limits the number of samples that can be sequenced on a weekly basis, increasing the risk of missing emerging variants of potential concern. In addition to its applications for WGS, NGS has also been used for mass-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing, such as in the SwabSeq method<sup>20</sup>; however, the latter does not provide full genome coverage. To counteract these limitations, here we present a versatile, scalable and cost-effective workflow\u2014COVseq\u2014that can be used to prepare multiplexed WGS libraries from many SARS-CoV-2 samples in parallel. We validate COVseq using RNA extracted from a SARS-CoV-2 viral culture as well as 274 diagnostic samples collected in three different phases of the ongoing pandemic at two hospitals in Italy. We demonstrate that the genome sequences obtained by COVseq are compatible with downstream phylogenomic analyses, including detailed phylogenetic reconstruction of a COVID-19 nosocomial outbreak that occurred in January 2021 at a single hospital in Italy. Lastly, we perform a real-life cost analysis based on our experience from the genomic surveillance program that we recently initiated for the Piemonte Region in North-West Italy, demonstrating that COVseq is a highly cost-effective method for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, including in low-income countries.</p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>While mass-scale vaccination campaigns are ongoing worldwide, genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical to monitor the emergence and global spread of viral variants of concern (VOC). Here, we present a streamlined workflow\u2014COVseq\u2014which can be used to generate highly multiplexed sequencing libraries compatible with Illumina platforms from hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 samples in parallel, in a rapid and cost-effective manner. We benchmarked COVseq against a standard library preparation method (NEBNext) on 29 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, reaching 95.4% of concordance between single-nucleotide variants detected by both methods. Application of COVseq to 245 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive samples demonstrated the ability of the method to reliably detect emergent VOC as well as its compatibility with downstream phylogenetic analyses. A cost analysis showed that COVseq could be used to sequence thousands of samples at less than 15 USD per sample, including library preparation and sequencing costs. We conclude that COVseq is a versatile and scalable method that is immediately applicable for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and easily adaptable to other pathogens such as influenza viruses.</p>",
