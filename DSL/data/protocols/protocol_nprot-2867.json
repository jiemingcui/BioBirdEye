            "content": "Metastasis is multi-step process that is defined by end points, where metastatic lesions are detected in specific organs distant from a primary tumor, but the precise mechanisms that regulate metastasis remains unknown \\(1). Cancer cells can use differential migratory strategies depending on environmental conditions while exiting the primary tumor mass and invading surrounding tissues \\(2). The plasticity of cancer cells seems to be linked to their ability to undergo stochastic phenotypic switching and acquire embryonic stem cell-like properties \\(2). We have recently described an alternative mechanism of melanoma metastasis distinct from intravascular dissemination, which we have termed, extravascular migratory metastasis \\(EVMM).  During EVMM, tumor cells migrate along the external surfaces of vascular channels, demonstrating angiotropism and a pericytic-like mimicry \\(3). EVMM may represent a unique metastatic pathway allowing tumor cells to migrate in a crawling manner under favourable environmental conditions.  Importantly, analogies of EVMM include neural crest cell migration \\(4), vasculogenesis and angiogenesis \\(5). Several histopathological studies on melanoma have also demonstrated that angiotropism, where melanoma cells are closely associated with the abluminal surfaces of vascular channels, in a pericytic location without intravasation \\(6), is a prognostic factor predicting risk for metastasis \\(7,8). We recently demonstrated that angiotropism could also be a marker of EVMM utilizing a modified in vivo shell-less chick chorioallantoic membrane assay to observe angiotropic melanoma cells spreading along microvascular channels in a pericytic-like manner \\(9). Finally, tumor cells from other types of cancers have also been reported to engage in angiotropism and potentially EVMM, including glioblastoma, prostate and pancreatic cancer cells \\(10-12).   \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAlthough the cellular decision making processes that cancer cells engages in to decipher environmental stimuli, undergo phenotypic switching and choose its direction of migration are key concepts that need to be explored further, there lacks a suitable method however to examine these concepts in real time.  Here, we developed a fluorescence based in vitro assay that monitors migration of individual cancer cells in the presence of capillary-like structures \\(13) in real time. We anticipate that this assay will provide a user-friendly interface to elucidate the mechanism of EVMM and future development of high throughput analysis of potential therapeutics that target and inhibit EVMM. This assay demonstrates a unique cancer metastasis assay reminiscent of the vascular environment, that can provide kinetic and quantitative analysis of cell migratory patterns as cell engage in EVMM. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis fluorescence based in vitro assay builds upon the endothelial cell tube formation assay previously described \\(13).   Briefly, we plate human endothelial cells on a basal membrane extract \\(BME) in a 96-well tissue culture plates.  In the presence BME, endothelial cells acquire the ability to form three-dimensional capillary-like structures or endothelial tubules that consist of a lumen surrounded by endothelial cells attached to one another by junctional complexes, and display a normal polarization \\(13). \r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nThis assay has been previously utilized as a quick and quantitative interface to examine inhibitors and activators of angiogenesis \\(14).   We extend this assay to monitor cancer cells as they engage in EVMM.  Briefly, we used fluorescence-labelled melanoma cancer cells and plated them in the presence of these newly formed vascular tubules \\(3, 18).  Following tubule formation, GFP-transfected C8161 human melanoma cells are introduced to cultures and we monitored in real time melanoma cancer cell migration toward and along endothelial cells and observed unique changes in the structural physiology of migrating melanoma cells suggesting epithelial to mesenchymal cell state transition \\(EMT).  Live cell imaging of this co-culture EVMM assay enabled quantitative analysis of migration in real time in single cells.   Imaging must be conducted on an inverted fluorescence microscope, such as the Nikon Eclipse Ti live-cell imaging microscope or others, as long as the microscopy is set with appropriate filters that correspond to the fluorophores. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMelanoma cells have been implicated to undergo phenotypic switching and exhibit migratory behaviour along the abluminal surface, however several studies have also implicated other cancer cells to engage in similar migratory dynamics and can be tested as well.  Similarly heterogenic cancer cell populations from primary tumors can also be examined to monitor how sub-populations of heterogenic cancer cell system exhibit specific migratory phenotypes.  Quantification of migratory behaviour can be accomplished in many ways including distance travelled and direction of travel of individual cancer cells using cell tracking programs \\(Nikon and ImageJ).  Changes in cellular morphology and the presence or absence, as well as length of filapodia and metastatic protrusions can be monitored and quantified \\(ImageJ and Nikon). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMetastasis is the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients.  This fluorescence-based assay to monitor EVMM could be complementary to the trans-well invasion assay, which focuses on intravascular metastasis \\(15). Our assay enables monitoring tumor cells as they engage in EVMM and provides a critical quantitative tool to elucidate the mechanisms of cancer cell migration and the metastatic potential of various cancer cell types.  We anticipate that this assay will enable better understanding on the molecular level the interaction between the abluminal surface of endothelial cells and angiotropic cancer cells. This ability to monitor EVMM in individual cells and in real time can also be utilized as a high-throughput array to test potential therapeutics that may inhibit or reduce cancer cell metastasis.  Furthermore, this assay can be modified to monitor factors that initiate cell phenotypic state transitions, specifically EMT in real time and in single cells.  Our studies have implicated an alternative form of cancer cell migration and cancer cell interaction with its vascular environment: a unique extra-vascular migration along the abluminal surfaces of vessels."

In conjunction with intra-vascular cellular migration, we recently proposed extra-vascular migratory metastasis \\(EVMM) as a means for cancer cells to venture away from the primary tumor via crawling along the abluminal vascular surface. Here, we propose a protocol that builds on a previous in vitro angiogenesis assay. This protocol details a co-culture approach to monitor fluorescence-tagged migrating cancer cells in the presence of vascular structures.   This fluorescence based single cell co-culture approach to monitor cancer cell migratory behavior in real time provides a quantitative approach to decipher the cell decision making processes that cancer cells engage in when undergoing phenotypic switching and exhibiting metastasis like dynamics.  This assay can also be adapted for high-throughput analysis and for therapeutic screening of cancer cell metastasis targets",
