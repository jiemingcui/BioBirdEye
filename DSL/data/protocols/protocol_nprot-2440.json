            "content": "A new technology to cryopreserve human ovarian cortex tissues more stably is needed in order to preserve fertility of female cancer patients.\r\n\n\n The supercooling phenomenon is a state in which even when the temperature falls below the freezing point, phase conversion from liquid to solid does not occur, though we must note that the supercooling state is eliminated by an external impact . When frozen instantly from a supercooled state facilitated by a variable magnetic field, freeze concentration is prevented and cell destruction is inhibited  \\(Ref. 1). However, the efficacy for the cryopreservation of human ovarian cortex tissues by using the supercooling technology is unclear in the world.\r\n\n\n Therefore, we investigated the efficacy."

The human ovary was rapidly transported to the laboratory in Leibovitz L-15 medium \\(Life Technologies, Merelbeke, Belgium). The human ovarian cortex was carefully dissected to obtain 40 small pieces \\(10 \u00d7 10 mm), which were then incubated for 30 min in a cryoprotective solution \\(Leibovitz medium supplemented with 1.5 M dimethylsulphoxide, 0.1 M sucrose, both provided by Sigma Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium and 10% patient\u2019s serum at 4.0\u00b0C). Each piece of the human ovarian cortex was cryopreserved in one 2-ml vial \\(Simport, Merck Eurolab, Leuven, Belgium), containing 1.4 ml of the cryoprotectant solution. The cryopreservation procedure as S.C. procedure was performed using our three supercooling machines < 1),  2), and 3) >.

The pieces of the human ovarian tissue were thawed on the day of the experimental procedure following a rapid protocol: vials were placed at room temperature for 2 min and then in water at 25.0\u00b0C for 2 min. The human ovarian tissue was washed stepwise for 5 min each in progressively lower concentrations of the cryoprotectant solution \\(1.5, 1, 0.5 and 0 mol/l).

After that, the pieces of the human ovarian tissue were transferred to conventional program freezer \\(Planner Kryo 360-3.3, Depex, Belgium). And, the pieces were cooled at 1.0\u00b0C/min to \u201340.0\u00b0C, 10.0\u00b0C/min to \u2013140.0\u00b0C within the conventional program freezer, and then plunged into liquid nitrogen. The pieces of the human ovarian tissue were thawed on the day of the experimental procedure following a rapid protocol: vials were placed at room temperature for 2 min and then in water at 25.0\u00b0C for 2 min.

Details for PCR primers used to analyze gene expression in total RNA samples prepared from human cells and tissues were according to the method of White YA, et al. \\(Ref.

Next, the human oocytes were transplanted within oviduct and were grown during 24 weeks within the oviduct.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 6: Human Follicle Counting\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n Follicles were only counted when the dark-staining nucleolus was seen within the nucleus of the oocytes to prevent recounting of the same follicle."
