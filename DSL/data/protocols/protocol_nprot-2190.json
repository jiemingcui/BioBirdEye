            "content": "Technological advances in microscopy have increased resolution to a point where sub-cellular compartments can be visualized.  The new insight about the distribution of different cellular structures such as secretory vesicles has spurred a need for analytical tools to examine and quantify the localization of different cellular components.  This type of insight has proven invaluable for structure/function analyses.  Using this approach, we recently showed that alpha cells within human pancreatic islets contain acetylcholine-releasing vesicles that do not colocalize with glucagon granules \\(Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011).  We performed colocalization analysis on human pancreatic sections immunostained for different cellular components \\(**Fig. 1**).  The colocalization analysis was performed according to Barlow and colleagues \\(Barlow et al., 2010) based on the fluorescence intensity of the different endocrine cell and nerve fiber markers acquired in separate channels \\(i.e., detectors).  Colocalization was defined as the detection of a fluorescence signal from two separate channels in the same voxel \\(3D pixel).  We used the Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient as a quantitative measure of colocalization of the different markers.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn brief, sections of human pancreata were co-immunostained either for glucagon and vesicular acetylcholine transporter \\(vAChT) or insulin and C-peptide.  DAPI was used as a nuclear counter-stain.  Immunostaining was performed as described previously \\(Cabrera et al., 2006; Cabrera et al., 2008; Jacques-Silva et al., 2010).  The colocalization analysis was performed using Volocity software on z-stacks of high resolution confocal images acquired using a Leica DMLFSA SP5microscope with a 60x oil immersion objective \\(1.4 numerical aperture).  The z-stacks were adjusted to span the full thickness of the pancreatic tissue sections \\(<sub>40 \u00b5m).  The x-y resolution ranged from </sub>20 to 240 nm and the z-resolution was 0.125 - 0.7 \u00b5m depending on the zoom factor and the step size in the z-stacks.  Different zoom factors were used to image whole islets with varying diameters and the option for \u201coptimized\u201d step size was selected to achieve the highest z-resolution on our equipment.  Automatic selection of either, glucagon and vAChT-positive objects \\(i.e., cells) or insulin and C-peptide-positive objects was based on fluorescence intensity.  A threshold value for the detection was set to three standard deviations \\(3x SD) of the minimum intensity \\(Barlow et al., 2010).  We performed the analysis in two steps: **1)** we first found \u201cobjects\u201d that were immunoreactive to two of the markers to be colocalized and we created regions of interest \\(ROIs) based on these objects; **2)** we performed the colocalization analysis within these ROIs.  To find the objects, a series of preset algorithms \\(i.e., protocols) available in Volocity was set up \\(**Fig. 2**).  Selection of the relevant objects was optimized with user feedback by eliminating objects by size \\(volume).  Eliminated objects typically had smaller volume than granules containing endocrine or nerve markers.  Colocalization analysis of either glucagon and vAChT or insulin and C-peptide was performed within the ROIs generated from the found objects using 3x SD threshold values for each of the channels \\(**Fig. 3**).  Thresholded values of the Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient were used for quantification and fitting. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe describe below the step-by-step protocol for the colocalization analysis using Volocity software.  In principal, this analysis procedure is applicable to images acquired with fluorescence imaging techniques other than confocal laser scanning microscopy with higher spatial resolution such as Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy \\(STED) or Photo-Activated Localization Microscopy \\(PALM)."

Drag raw data file\\(s) into pre-created library\\(s) to import calibrated images.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**CAUTION**  Image calibration is typically encoded in the raw data generated with microscopes from most manufacturers \\(e.g., Leica, Zeiss, Nikon, etc).  Do not import z-stacks as \u201ctiff\u201d files because image calibration will be lost.  Volocity can read raw data files from most manufacturers.  If only \u201ctiff\u201d files are available, reassembly of the z-stacks in the proper order and calibration of the image dimensions are required.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2.**  Select a raw image from the library \\(list of images on the left) and switch to the \u201cMeasurements\u201d view within the library by clicking the \u201cMeasurements\u201d tab \\(see **Fig. 2**).\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n**CAUTION**  Do not manipulate images to be analyzed as noise removal or background subtraction will influence the analysis.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3.**  Under the \u201cMeasurements\u201d view, build the analysis algorithm sequence from the list of existing protocols \\(i.e., algorithms; **Fig. 2a**).  Drag the appropriate protocols from the list of protocols and stack them in the specified sequence exactly as shown in **Fig 2a**.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**CRITICAL STEP**  Order of the algorithm sequence must be maintained for proper analysis.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**4.**  In the \u201cFind Objects\u201d protocol, select the appropriate channel for the marker to be analyzed and set the threshold to 3x standard deviations \\(3x SD) \\(**Fig. 2a**).  Display the threshold popup window by clicking the cog icon and change \u201cThreshold using\u201d to \u201cSD\u201d and set the \u201cLower Limit\u201d value to 3 \\(**Fig. 2b**). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**5.**  To execute the analysis, either click \u201cUpdate Feedback\u201d under the \u201cMeasurement\u201d tab of the program \\(next to the \u201cFile\u201d tab) or select \u201cAutomatically Update Feedback\u201d.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**CAUTION**  If working with large datasets, we recommend updating the feedback/analysis manually to avoid frequent software stall/crashes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**6.**  The results of the analysis are displayed automatically and found objects are highlighted \\(**Fig. 2b**).  Since the last step in the protocol is to \u201cMake ROIs from objects\u201d, the found objects are selected as regions of interest \\(ROIs) automatically \\(**Figs. 2b** and **3a**).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**CAUTION**  Do not click outside the ROIs if one of the ROI tools is selected because that will deselect the ROIs and will require repeating Steps 5 & 6.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**7.**  Switch to the \u201cColocalization\u201d view in the library by clicking the \u201cColocalization\u201d tab and select the appropriate channels to be analyzed.  Only 2 channels can be selected at any given time.\r\n\n\n**8.**  Use the same threshold values as in **Step 4** \\(i.e., 3x SD) to set the minimum intensity value for each channel \\(see **Fig. 3c**).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**CRITICAL STEP**  Threshold absolute values corresponding to 3xSD can be obtained from **Step 4** \\(see **Fig. 2b**) for the corresponding channels by \u201cmousing\u201d over the lower limit bar in the intensity histogram.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**9.**  Graphical and numerical results of the colocalization analysis are displayed automatically \\(**Fig. 3b-d**).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**CAUTION**  Colocalization results are shown based on thresholded and non-thresholded \\(\u201cGlobal\u201d) analysis; use the results in the \u201cThresholded Statistics\u201d field."

The insets in (*b-d*) show the \u201cThresholded\u201d and \u201cGlobal\u201d or non-thresholded statistics of the colocalization of the selected channels.  These results show representative colocalization analysis of partially colocalized glucagon with vAChT (Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient = 0.272), complete segregation of glucagon and DAPI (-0.13), and strong colocalization of insulin with C-peptide (0.613).  The upper inset in (*c*) shows the field where absolute intensity values corresponding to a threshold of 3x SD for each channel are set in *Step 8* in the *PROCEDURE*.   ",

        "manuscriptAbstract": "We describe here how to perform colocalization analysis in different endocrine cells of human pancreatic tissue.  Immunostained endocrine cells were imaged using high resolution three-dimensional \\(3D) confocal microscopy.  The analysis of the 3D images was performed using Volocity software based on the fluorescence intensity of the different markers acquired in separate channels.  The described procedure can be used for colocalization analysis in immunostained tissues other than pancreatic islets.  Special attention should be paid to the limits of the imaging resolution and quality for proper colocalization analyses, especially, those involving sub-cellular compartments.  Execution of the described procedure will highly depend on the computer processing speed; in our hands, it took a few minutes per islet.  However, the overall time of analysis will vary significantly depending on the sampling size to accomplish statistical power of analysis.",
