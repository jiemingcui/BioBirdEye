            "content": "One or more modular lipid-binding domains mediate recruitment of signalling proteins to the different cellular sites through specific lipid recognition. These processes play a role in the partition of signalling proteins between different membrane compartments and influence the selectivity of their response.\r\n\n\n<sup>1,2</sup> The modulation of the membrane affinity provide an additional level of regulation/integration in signaling pathways. Several examples of unfolded domains or unfolded proteins binding to membranes have been reported, in which the protein-membrane interaction is regulated by diverse molecular mechanisms, like acylation and/or electrostatic switch and/or CaM binding.<sup>3,4</sup> For the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region of Src Family Kinases \\(SFKs), it was shown that myristoylation and/or palmitoylation of the SH4 domain at the N-terminus are critical for SFKs localization and trafficking<sup>5,6,7</sup>; moreover, phosphorylation of serines/threonines close the attachment site could contribute to its release from the membrane.<sup>8,9</sup>\r\n\n\nMany methodologies are suitable to study protein-lipid interactions.<sup>10,11,12</sup> Use of lipid microarrays and strips is simple and fast.<sup>13</sup> Membrane Lipid Strips consist in hydrophobic membranes that have been spotted with phosphoinositides and/or other biologically relevant lipids. They allow detecting protein binding to one or more of these lipids. Bound proteins are detected using antibodies against the protein or a suitable affinity tag. Bicelles are formed when bilayer forming long-chain lipids are mixed with detergent molecules \\(or short chain lipids).<sup>14,15,16</sup> They present a disk-like structure, with a central planar bilayer formed by the long-chain phospholipids, surrounded by a rim of short-chain phospholipids or detergent protecting the long-chain lipid tails from water. These disk-like aggregates are formed at low concentration of the long-chain lipid and high concentration of detergent. Importantly, bicelles prepared as explained in this work have been proven to maintain the morphology and the bilayer organization typical of their liquid-crystalline counterparts,<sup>17</sup> them reliable for membrane mimics purpose."

Many IDPs are implicated in several diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases and others. We have developed a detailed protocol for purifying the intrinsically disordered Unique domain of the human non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src. Moreover, here we introduce two additional techniques that have been used to assess the capability of the protein to binding lipids: a simple protein-lipid assay \\(Echelon Lipid Strip<sup>TM</sup>) and a NMR approach where we have observed the unfolded Unique domain of c-Src in the presence of different types of bicelles.",
