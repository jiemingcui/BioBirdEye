            "content": "Proteins can be methylated on the side-chain nitrogens of lysine and arginine residues or on carboxy-termini<sup>1, 2</sup>. Protein methylation is a component of cellular information network and a way of subtly changing the primary sequence of a peptide so that it can encode more information. This common posttranslational modification is implicated in the regulation of a variety of processes. Within signaling pathways, protein methylation occurs both proximal to receptor mediated responses<sup>3, 4</sup> and distal to primary signaling events, where methylation of histones is crucial for laying down the histone code and the subsequent activation \\(or inactivation) of transcriptional loci<sup>5</sup>. In addition, methylation is involved in protein trafficking6, the biogenesis of spliceosomal proteins<sup>7, 8</sup> and the regulation of protein-protein interactions<sup>7, 9</sup>. Lysine residues can be methylated by the SET domain-dependent lysine methyltransferases<sup>10</sup>. Lysine residues can accept up to three methyl groups forming mono-, di-, and trimethylated derivatives<sup>11</sup>. The analysis of protein methylation can be performed by using recombinant enzymes and substrates, or by mass spectrum. In this protocol, we will use the mass spectrum to verify actin K84 monomethylation<sup>12-14</sup>."

            "content": "Anti-actin K84me1 antibody generation\r\n\n\nRabbit polyclonal anti-actin K84 monomethylated antibody \\(anti-actin K84me1) was generated using a synthetic peptide with monomethylated lysine84 \\(77TNWDDMEmKIWHHTFY91) as immunogen \\(New England Peptide, Boston, USA). The antibody was double affinity purified from rabbit serum \\(that means, first the sera is run over the unmethylated column to adsorb non-specific antibody, then the flow-through from this column is run over the methylated peptide column) and then lyophilized \\(New England Peptide, Boston, USA).\r\n\n\nAnti-actin K84me1 antibody verification\r\n\n\n1. Have nitrocellulose membrane ready, draw grid by pencil to indicate the region you are going to blot.\r\n  2. Using narrow-mouth pipet tip, spot 2 \u03bcl of samples onto the nitrocellulose membrane at the center of the grid. Minimize the area that the solution penetrates \\(usually 3-4 mm diam.) by applying it slowly.\r\n  3. Let the membrane dry.\r\n  4. Transfer the membrane to 5 ml Ponceau S Stain solution \r\n  5. Place on an orbital shaker for 15 min at room temperature. \r\n  6. Rinse membrane with ddH\n2\nO to achieve desired staining; approximately 1-2 washes of 2 min each will remove the background staining. Record the result by camera.\r\n  7. Wash the membrane 2-3 times with ddH\n2\nO for 5 min each to remove Ponceau S.\r\n  8. Block non-specific sites by soaking in 5% Non-Fat milk in TBS-T for 0.5 h at RT.\r\n  9. Incubate with primary antibody \\(1 \u03bcg/ml for purified antibody, 1:1000 dilution for anti-actin K84me1) dissolved in 5% Non-Fat milk in TBS-T for 2 h at RT.\r\n  10. Wash three times with TBS-T \\(3 \u00d7 5 min).\r\n  11. Incubate with secondary antibody conjugated with HRP for 30 min at RT.\r\n  12. Wash three times with TBS-T \\(3 \u00d7 5 min), then once with TBS \\(5 min).\r\n  13. Incubate with ECL reagent for 5 min and expose X-ray film in the dark room. Try several different lengths of exposure.\r\n  14. Compare the signal from your unknown sample to that of standard and estimate the concentration.\r\n  15. Actin-K84me1 antibody specifically recognizes K84-monomethylated actin \\(**Fig. 1a**).\r\n  16. We also verify the anti-actin K84me1 antibody with HA-\u03b2-actin K84A/R by immunoblotting \\(**Fig. 1b**).\r\n  HA-\u03b2-actin purification\r\n\n\n1. Prepare the cell lysate using ice cold 0.1% NET Buffer. \\(4 \u00d7 10cm dishes)\r\n  2. Carefully mix EZview Red Anti-HA Affinity Gel beads until completely and uniformly suspended. Add 100 \u00b5l of the 50% slurry into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube on ice.\r\n  3. Wash beads twice in 0.1% NET Buffer by adding 750 \u00b5l of NET 0.1% Buffer to the tube, and centrifuge in a microcentrfuge for approximately 30 s at 6,000 \u00d7 g. Discard the supernatant.\r\n  4. Whole cell extract was generated by lysing cells in 0.1% NET buffer followed by sonication using a Sonic Dismembrator \\(10% output, 1 min, with 10 s-on and 20 s-off cycles)\r\n  5. Immediately centrifuge the lysate for 10 min at 14,000 \u00d7 g in a microcentrifuge at 4\u00baC to pellet cell debris.\r\n  6. Carefully remove the clear lysate supernatant from step 5 with a 1 ml micropipette and transfer into the tube of equilibrated EZview Red Anti-HA Affinity Gel beads from step 3. Incubate with thorough, gentle mixing for 3 h at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  7. Centrifuge in a microcentrifuge for 30 s at 6,000 \u00d7 g. Aspirate supernatant carefully.\r\n  8. Wash the bead pellet by adding 1 ml of TBS. Incubate with thorough, gentle mixing at 4\u00baC for 5 min. Centrifuge in a microcentrifuge for 30 s at 6,000 \u00d7 g. Aspirate supernatant carefully and set the tube with the bead pellet on ice.\r\n  9. Repeat washes two more times as in step 8.\r\n  10. Elution of the HA-fusion protein with HA peptide. The HA-tagged protein bound to the resin may be eluted with HA peptide. Add the desired volume of a freshly prepared 100 \u00b5g/ml solution of HA peptide in 50 mM pH 7.4 Tris-HCl buffer. Incubate the affinity gel sample for 10 min and recover the supernatant after pelleting the affinity gel by centrifugation.\r\n  HA-\u03b2-actin precipitation:\r\n\n\n1. Add 4 fold volume of \u201320\u00baC acetone to ice-cold sample solution,\r\n  2. Mix well and keep at \u201320\u00baC for at least 30 min. \r\n  3. Spin in a refrigerated microfuge at top speed for 30 min. \r\n  4. Remove supernatant and air-dry the pellet. \r\n  Protease digestion:\r\n\n\n1.

Add TCEP to final concentration of 5 mM and incubate at RT for 20 min\r\n  3. Add iodoacetamide to 10 mM and incubate at RT for 15 min in the dark.\r\n  4. Dilute to 2 M urea with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5\r\n  5. Add methylamine to 20 mM to reduce carbamylation\r\n  6. Add Asp-N \\(according to 1:50 enzyme : substrate), incubate overnight at 37 \u00baC in the dark\r\n  7. Add EDTA to 0.5 mM to inactivate Asp-N\r\n  8. Add DTT to 5 mM, CaCl\n2\nto 8.5 mM and Arg-C \\(according to 1:50 enzyme : substrate), incubate for 8 hours at 37 \u00baC in the dark\r\n  9. Quench with 5% Formic acid\r\n  Desalting:\r\n\n\n1. Load samples onto a precolumn \\(250 \u03bcm ID) with 2 cm C18 resin \\(10 \u03bcm) under flow rate of about 1 \u03bcl/min.\r\n  2. Wash with 0.1% Formic acid for 10 min.\r\n  3. Elute with 20 \u03bcl 80% ACN, 0.1% Formic acid.\r\n  4. Dry with Centrivap.\r\n  5. Resuspend with the NET buffer \\(without NP-40).\r\n  Actin K84me1 peptide enrichment\r\n\n\n1. Take 20 \u03bcl of protein A beads slurry for one sample, spin at 6,000 for 1 min, at 4\u00baC. Discard the supernatant.\r\n  2. Wash beads twice in NET Buffer \\(without NP-40) by adding 750 \u00b5l of NET Buffer to the tube, and centrifuge in a microcentrfuge for approximately 30 s at 6,000 \u00d7 g. Discard the supernatant.\r\n  3. Add peptides to the beads. Then add proper NET buffer to this tube up to 500 \u00b5l and incubate in 4\u00baC rotator for 60 min.\r\n  4. Spin at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 3 minutes and transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube.\r\n  5. Add 2 \u00b5g of purified Rabbit IgG control antibody or 2 \u00b5g anti-K84me1 antibody to the pre clean cell lysate. Incubate for 2 h hour in the 4\u00baC rotator. \r\n  6. Add 40 \u00b5l of the protein A beads to a new microcentrifuge tube and wash it 3 times with NET buffer \\(without NP-40).\r\n  7. Add the lysate and antibody mixture to the washed beads and incubate for 1 h at 4\u00baC with gentle agitation.\r\n  8. Spin in centrifuge at 6,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00baC for 1 min.\r\n  9. Discard supernatant and wash the beads in 1 \u00d7 TBS buffer \\(add 1mM PMSF before used) 5 times \\(each time centrifuging at 4\u00baC and removing the supernatant). Each time agitate the tube in the e 4\u00baC rotator for 5 min.\r\n  10. Then spin down the beads at 6,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00baC for 2 min. Remove the supernatant carefully and completely.\r\n  11. Add 70 \u00b5l elution buffer \\(0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5) to each sample and control resin.\r\n  12. Incubate the samples and controls with gentle shaking for 10 min at room temperature. Do not leave the resin in this buffer more than 20 min.\r\n  13. Centrifuge the resin for 1 min at 8,200 \u00d7 g. Transfer the supernatants to fresh test tubes containing 7 \u03bcl 1 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0. Be careful not to transfer any resin.\r\n  Desalting:\r\n\n\n1. Load samples onto a precolumn \\(250 \u03bcm ID) with 2 cm C18 resin \\(10 \u03bcm) under flow rate of about 1 \u03bcl/min.\r\n  2. Wash with 0.1% Formic acid for 10 min.\r\n  3.
