            "header": "Procedure",
            "content": "General Considerations:\nWhether pre-preparation steps such as homogenization or pre-digestion of the sample are required depends on the physical properties of the sample material, and consequently the difficulty in releasing the DNA containing cells from the surrounding tissue.\nDecontamination of sample material, to remove potential non-species DNA, is required where sample material was exposed to the environment prior to collection.\nTo allow for simultaneous DNA extraction from all source materials, sample-preparation (procedure part I) and pre-digestion (procedure part II) of hair-, feather and insect samples should take place on the day prior to utilization of the silica kit-based protocol (procedure part III).\u00a0Pre-digestion of the tissue samples (raw and processed meat) should start 2h prior to the extraction (procedure part III) on the same day. Saliva will not require any pre-digestion, and is thus sub-sampled directly prior to the start of the extraction (procedure part III).\nDuring each part of the procedure, at least one blank control should be included and carried through the remainder of the procedure to establish appropriate contamination controls. With regards to the pre-digestion (procedure part II), separate blank controls for long and short pre-digests should be established.\nI. Sample preparation:\n- Hair:\nThe protocol is suitable for extraction of DNA from hair of a variety of species including human head or body hair. Both, guard hair (top coat) and down hair (undercoat) can be used. In case of coarse hair, 1-3 strands are sufficient. Where hair is very fine or short, up to 5 strands should be used.\n1.\u00a0Sampling: 1-5 strands of hair\n2.\u00a0Sample is placed in 2ml reaction tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted)\n3.\u00a0washed in 1ml PCR-grade water (UltraPure\u2122, Invitrogen)\n4.\u00a0washed in 500 \u03bcl Ethanol (abs.)\n5.\u00a0air-dried (tube overhead at an angle) until remaining traces of Ethanol are evaporated (min. 30min)\n- Feathers:\nThe protocol is suitable for extraction of DNA from hair of any bird species. Both vane- and down feathers can be utilized. Depending on the size of the feather, 5-10 barbs (from the vane or after-feather) or down-barbs should be sampled.\n1.\u00a0Sampling: 5-10 barbs are removed from the rachis (forceps, Uspeck or microscopy scissors, Bochem)\n2.\u00a0Sample is placed in 2ml reaction tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted)\n3.\u00a0washed in 1ml PCR-grade water (UltraPure\u2122, Invitrogen)\n4.\u00a0washed in 500 \u03bcl Ethanol (abs.)\n5.\u00a0air-dried (tube overhead at an angle) until remaining traces of Ethanol are evaporated (min. 30min)\n- Insects or insect parts:\nIf extraction of DNA specific to the species of the insect specimen is intended, sampling of head, thorax and abdomen should be avoided, to exclude contribution of DNA from food sources. Instead, appendages such as legs and wings should be sampled, depending on anatomy of species analyzed.\n1. Sampling: 1-2 wings, 1-3 legs (depending on size of the insect) are removed (forceps, Uspeck)\n2.\u00a0Sample is placed in 2ml reaction tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted)\n3.\u00a0washed in 1ml PCR-grade water (UltraPure\u2122, Invitrogen)\n4.\u00a0washed in 500 \u03bcl Ethanol (abs.)\n5.\u00a0air-dried (tube overhead at an angle) until remaining traces of Ethanol are evaporated (min. 30min)\n- Muscle tissue (raw and processed meat):\nBoth, raw muscle tissue and processed meat can be utilized. Recovery of pristine DNA is expected to be higher in case of raw compared to processed meat, which will have been exposed to DNA-degrading conditions such as heat.\n0.1g of tissue is sampled, placed in a 2ml reaction tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted)\n- Saliva:\nNeither pre-preparation steps, nor a pre-digestion of the material is required. The modified version of the manufacturer protocol is sufficient for optimal extraction of DNA from this material.\n100ul of homogenized (mixed) saliva us pipetted into a 2ml reaction tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted) at the stat of the silica column based extraction (procedure part III).\nII. Pre-digestion:\nA pre-digestion of sample material with proteinase K is utilized for sample material which requires a more extensive digestion than the one included in the modified silica-kit protocol (procedure part III).\n- Hair:\n1.\u00a0Decontaminated hair strands are cut into 0.5-1cm sections using decontaminated scissors (microscopy scissors, Bochem), by cutting the sections directly into a 2ml reaction tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted)\n2.\u00a0Cuttings are mixed with 250ul PBS (1x) and 20ul proteinase K (10mg/ml)\n3.\u00a0The lid of the 2ml reaction tube should be sealed using a thin strip of Parafilm (Bemis Corp.)\n4.\u00a0Incubation at 56\u00b0C, overnight to 20h\n- Feathers:\n1.\u00a0Interlocked vane barbs are separated from each other (forceps, Uspeck) to increase the surface exposed to the proteinase K digestion, and placed into a 2ml reaction tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted)\n2.\u00a0Barbs are mixed with 250ul PBS (1x) and 20ul proteinase K (10mg/ml)\n3.\u00a0The lid of the 2ml reaction tube should be sealed using a thin strip of Parafilm (Bemis Corp.)\n4.\u00a0Incubation at 56\u00b0C, overnight to 20h\n- Insects or insect parts:\n1.\u00a0Insect parts are placed into a new 2ml reaction tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted)\n2.\u00a0mixed with 250ul PBS (1x) and 20ul proteinase K (10mg/ml)\n3.\u00a0Homogenization of insect parts using a 1000ul pipet tip (Sarstedt) as pestle against the wall of the 2ml reaction tube\n4.\u00a0The lid of the 2ml reaction tube should be sealed using a thin strip of Parafilm (Bemis Corp.)\n5.\u00a0Incubation at 56\u00b0C, overnight to 20h\n- Muscle tissue (raw and processed meat):\n1.\u00a00.1g of tissue in a 2ml reaction tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted) is mixed with 250ul PBS (1x) and 20ul proteinase K (10mg/ml)\n2.\u00a0Tissue is macerated using a 1000ul pipet tip (Sarstedt) as pestle against the wall of the 2ml reaction tube\n3.\u00a0The lid of the 2ml reaction tube should be sealed using a thin strip of Parafilm (Bemis Corp.)\n5.\u00a0Incubation at 56\u00b0C for 1-2h\n- Saliva:\nNo pre-digestion is required!\nIII. Silica Kit-based DNA Extraction (common protocol):\nThe protocol here is a modified version of the manufacturer instruction for the E.Z.N.A.\u00ae Blood DNA Mini Kit using the \"Buccal Swabs Protocol\" (Omega Bio-Tek 2019); without addition of PBS to sample material (which is already in liquid form), an extended Proteinase K incubation (30min instead of 10min), elution in 100\u03bcl PCR grade water (UltraPure\u2122, Invitrogen) heated to 65\u00b0C instead of Elution Buffer, and with re-application of the eluate to the silica column for the second elution step, instead of using a second volume of water.\n1.\u00a0For the extraction, the complete pre-digest from procedure part II is used.\nIn case of saliva, 100\u03bcl of a homogenized sample are placed in a 2ml tube (SafeSeal, Sarsted).\nAn extraction blank is established with 100\u03bcl ultrapure water (UltraPure\u2122, Invitrogen).\n2.\u00a0After addition of 25\u03bcl Proteinase K Solution (kit component) and 500\u03bcl BL Buffer (kit component), the sample is thoroughly mixed\n3.\u00a0Incubation at 65\u00b0C for 30min.\n4.\u00a0The proteinase K digest is terminated by addition of 100\u03bcl of Ethanol (abs.) and thorough mixing\n5.\u00a0Sample can be briefly centrifuged to avoid liquid remaining in the lid of the tube\n6.\u00a0Silica column (kit component:\nHiBind\n\u00ae\nDNA Mini Column) is placed in a 2ml collection tube (kit component)\n7.\u00a0750\u03bcl of the sample is transferred to the column\n8.\u00a0After centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 1min, the filtrate is discarded\n9.\u00a0Steps 7 and 8 are repeated until the remainder of the sample has been transferred completely, after which the column is placed into a new collection tube\n10.\u00a0Following addition of 500\u03bcl HBC Buffer (kit component), the column is centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 1min and the filtrate is discarded\n11.\u00a0After adding 700\u03bcl DNA Wash Buffer (kit component), the column is centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 1min and the filtrate is discarded\n12.\u00a0The wash step is repeated with a second aliquot of 700\u03bcl DNA Wash Buffer\n13.\u00a0To remove any residual ethanol, the column matrix is dried by further centrifugation at maximum speed (at least 10,000 x g) for 2min, after which the column is transferred to a 2ml (SafeSeal, Sarsted)\n14.\u00a0To elute the DNA from the silica matrix, 100\u03bcl ultrapure water (UltraPure\u2122, Invitrogen), pre-heated to 65\u00b0C, are added to the column, and incubated for 5min at RT, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 1min\n15.\u00a0The elution step is repeated by re-applying the eluate to the column, followed by incubation and centrifugation as described in step 14, to elute any DNA remaining bound to the silica matrix after the first elution.\nExtracts should be stored at 4\u00b0C to avoid any degradation of DNA due to freeze-thaw cycles prior to analysis. For long-term storage, 20\u00b0C is recommended\n14\n."
