            "content": "Butterflies are famous for their extraordinarily diverse wing patterns, which differ not only among species, but also among populations, sexes, and even seasonal forms<sup>3,4</sup>. Beyond wing pattern, butterflies are also diverse in virtually all aspects of their biology, ranging from behavior and biogeography to cellular biology and biochemistry, with decades of study having placed much of this variation in a well-resolved ecological context<sup>5</sup>. These features make butterflies a promising system to explore the genetics, evolution, and development of morphological diversification and speciation<sup>6,7</sup>. While butterflies have notable strengths in terms of natural variation and ecology, they also suffer critical shortcomings in the quest to characterize the genetic basis of organismal phenotypes, in particular due to a lack of functional genetics methodology. Recently, clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat \\(CRISPR) associated \\(Cas) based RNA-guided DNA endonucleases such as the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 \\(SpCas9) nuclease \\(CRISPR/Cas9) has emerged as an efficient tool for gene editing across a wide spectrum of organisms<sup>1,2</sup>, including insects such as fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster<sup>8,9</sup> and silkworm Bombyx mori<sup>10,11</sup>. Here, following the dissection of high quality reference genomes for the two highly heterozygous and closely related butterflies P. xuthus and P. machaon, we develop an efficient CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing method that results in obvious phenotypes with three genes, Abdominal-B, ebony, and frizzled in P. xuthus \\(Figure 3, Tables 2-4)."

Adult and hand pair\r\n  Pupae were reared in plastic baskets at room temperature or under the conditions of 26 \u00b0C, 75% relative humidity and 18h/6h light/darkness. Emerged adults were crossed via hand-pairing\n14,15\n. \r\n\n\n2. Egg laying, collecting and preparing\r\n  Mated females were transferred into net room with host plants for oviposition. Eggs were collected from the host plant leafs following 15-60 min oviposition bouts, dipped into clear water and then aligned on the microscope slide mounted into a model designed by our lab using soft paintbrush, fixed by glue.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Microinjection and egg hatching**\r\n\n\n1. _Microinjection_\r\n  2 nl mixture of sgRNA\\(s) and Cas9-encoding mRNA with the different combination of final concentration was injected through the chorion into each egg under a stereoscopic microscope \\(Nikon SMZ800), using an TransferMan NK2 and FemtoJet microinjection system.\r\n\n\n2. _Hatching_\r\n  Injected eggs contained in the petri dishes were placed in an incubator at 25\u00b0C and 70% relative humidity. When embryos are close to hatch, host leaves \\(e.g a horticulturally rutaceous plant \\(Zanthxylum piperitum) are placed into the dishes for newly hatched larva feeding. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Breeding and Phenotyping**\r\n\n\n1. _Breeding_\r\n  The leaves with newly hatched larvae are carefully transferred into large petri dishes. All larva were fed on host leaf collectively or individually in glass containers. Container is cleaned and leaves of host plant are renewed every day. Pupae are transferred into plastic baskets to eclose.\r\n\n\n2. _Phenotyping_\r\n  For developed but unhatched eggs, which are morphologically black, we dissect larvae from eggs and observe their morphological traits using stereoscopic microscope. Larvae of the newly hatched and the second instar were carefully checked using stereoscopic microscope and pictured using microscopic digital camera if there are morphological changes compared with wild type. From third instar larvae on, morphologic changes in different developmental stages are observed using stereoscopic microscope or by naked eyes. In the cases of the three genes, we mainly observe abdomen habitus for Abd-B; for ebony, we mainly pay attention to the color of larvae and adults; for frizzled, we mainly observe the cuticular structures.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Genotyping**\r\n\n\n1. _Sampling, genomic DNA extraction, and target loci amplification_\r\n  Sampling strategies are determined based on the anticipated phenotypes of target genes and the developmental situation of injected individuals. Genomic DNA extraction and PCR for unhatched larva dissected from developed eggs are carried out using Animal Tissue Direct PCR kit \\(FOREGENE, China) following manual instruction; genomic DNA of hatched larva, prepupa, pupa and adult are extracted using Gentra Puregene Blood Kit \\(Qiagen, Germany), and their target sites are amplified using exTaq polymerase. Amplified target region \\(300-800 bp) are purified with Qiagen PCR purification kit, and eluted in 30\u03bcl Nuclease-free water. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. _T7 endonuclease I mutation detection assays_\r\n  Purified or unpurified PCR products of target loci were for T7 endonuclease I \\(T7EI) mutation detection assays as previously described 16. It is noted that T7E1 might cause false positives if the target DNA sequences carry allelic polymorphism, AT-rich region, or sequence differences due to PCR errors.\r\n\n\n3. _Cloning and Sequencing_\r\n  T7EI positive and/or morphologically mutated individuals were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing 12 TA clones. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Validation of expression of disrupted gene**\r\n\n\nExpression changes \\(mRNA level or at protein level) of disrupted gene in mutant and wild type can provide direct clues to gene function.\r\n\n\n1. _Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR \\(qRT-PCR)_\r\n  1) Design and order primers for target gene and internal control gene. \r\n\n\nNote: The gene for cytoplasmis actin gene A3 that is expressed constitutively in the cell was used as an internal standard to estimate the relative expression of mRNA in the current study. \r\n\n\n2) Total RNA was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method \\(Trizol, Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. \r\n\n\nNote: For the individuals of small body such as eggs, the first instar larvae etc., at least five individuals are needed as one biological sample for extraction of total RNA. Three biological replicates were carried out for both mutants and wild types.\r\n\n\n3) Reverse transcribe mRNA into cDNA using the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit \\(Thermo) according to instructions. \r\n\n\n4) Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using QUANTSTUDIOTM 12K FLEX \\(Applied Biosystems) with the SYBR Premix Ex Taq \\(Takara), with four experiment duplicates for each sample.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nddH2O                                   7 \u03bcl \r\n\n\n2X SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex Taq \\(Tli RNaseH Plus)   10 \u03bcl\r\n\n\n10\u03bcM PCR Forward Primer                  0.5 \u03bcl\r\n\n\n10\u03bcM PCR Reverse Primer                  0.5 \u03bcl\r\n\n\n100 ng DNA template                        2 \u03bcl       \r\n\n\n                                        20 \u03bcl\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n95 \u00b0C                   20 s\r\n\n\n95 \u00b0C                   15 s\r\n\n\n95 \u00b0C, -1.6\u00b0C/s  58 \u00b0C    20 s    \u00d7 40 cycles \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5) Data analysis\r\n\n\nThe relative expression of target gene in mutants and in wild type was analyzed by 2-\u0394\u0394CT method. The differences in expression of Abd-B gene between mutants and wild type were compared by SPSS16.0 statistics software \\(SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) using Independent_Sample t Test. A p value <0.05 was considered significant.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. _Western blot analysis_: Abd-B protein as an example\r\n  1) Antibody preparation\r\n\n\na. Retrieve antibody to the protein of target gene ortholog in other insects \\(e.g. fruitlfy) in the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank \\(DSHB) and, if yes, order. E.g. \\(1A2E9) \\(DSHB).\r\n\n\nb. Select internal control gene \\(e.g. \u03b2-actin) and order its antibody.\r\n\n\nc. Order the second antibody.\r\n\n\n2) Protein samples were prepared in RIPA buffer \\(Sigma) from mutants and wild-types. \r\n\n\nFor small body such as eggs, the first instar larvae, about 10 individuals are needed as one biological sample for extraction of protein. \r\n\n\n3) All protein samples from 10 individuals were run on 10% SDS-polyacylamide gels.\r\n\n\n4) Transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride \\(PVDF) membranes. \r\n\n\n5) Blocking: incubate membranes in 10 ml 5% bovine albumin for 1 h in shaking table. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6) Detect target gene product\r\n\n\na.
