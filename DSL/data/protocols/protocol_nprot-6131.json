            "content": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization \\(MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging \\(MSI) is a powerful technique for visualizing the chemical composition of surfaces and tissue sections. Due to its excellent sensitivity and lateral resolution of down to 1 \u00b5m <sup>1,2</sup> MALDI MSI is widely used to unveil the local distribution of lipids<sup>3</sup>, peptides<sup>4</sup>, proteins<sup>5,6</sup>, endogenous/ exogenous metabolites<sup>7</sup> or natural products<sup>8</sup> in various biological systems. Over the last decade the analytical sensitivity<sup>9</sup> and the acquisition speed<sup>10</sup> for MALDI MSI instruments improved dramatically. As a consequence, new fields of application for MALDI MSI evolved in chemistry<sup>11,12</sup>, biology<sup>13</sup>, medicine<sup>14</sup> and life sciences<sup>15,16</sup>. Laser desorption ionization \\(LDI), on the other hand allows to obtain lateral resolutions down to 0.5 \u00b5m<sup>17</sup>, but LDI ionization yields are typically below those of MALDI techniques and significant fragmentation of analytes is regularly encountered.<sup>18</sup> Nevertheless, LDI MSI has been used for example to study the spatial distribution of lichen specialized metabolites for Ophioparma ventosa<sup>19</sup> or to investigate heated coal with a temperature gradient incorporating a plastic layer and semi-coke.<sup>20</sup> LDI MSI was also used to study nematodes ingesting plant toxins from infected banana roots.<sup>21</sup>\r\n\n\nOne major disadvantage of LDI and MALDI MSI techniques is the necessity for using flat samples with height differences less than <sub>50 \u00b5m, to avoid shading and imaging artifacts in the resulting MS images.<sup>22</sup> No currently existing LDI or MALDI MSI method is applicable to irregular three-dimensional \\(3D) surfaces without squandering information on relative analyte abundance, sample height or ablation area size. In an offline, manual low-resolution cartography approach, three-dimensional chemical information has been visualized by consecutively performing a series of steps, including sampling individual surface spots, externally measuring mass spectra of samples and reconstructing 3D surface maps of the human body.<sup>23</sup> The major drawback of this approach is the long sampling time, the two step approach and the limited spatial resolution of the employed extraction techniques in the millimeter range. Several groups have focused on combining MSI and surface probe microscopy. For example a heated atomic force microscopy \\(AFM) probe was combined with MSI and the performance was demonstrated for imaging inked patterns<sup>24</sup> and a Pseudomonas strain GM17 colony on agar<sup>25</sup>. The heated AFM probe acted both as a force sensor for topographical imaging and for thermal desorption of analyte molecules from the substrate followed by either electrospray ionization \\(ESI)<sup>26</sup> or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization \\(APCI) MS<sup>27,25</sup>. An alternative way to integrate topographic methods in MSI combines scanning near-field optical microscopy \\(SNOM) and laser desorption of material from surfaces, combined with plasma ionization<sup>28</sup> or electron ionization<sup>29</sup> MS. An approach called constant-distance mode MSI was developed by Laskin and co-workers.<sup>30</sup> Bacillus subtilis ATCC 49670 colonies on agar plates were analyzed with a nanospray desorption electrospray ionization \\(nano-DESI) probe with an integrated shear-force probe. This constant-distance mode nano-DESI MSI allows imaging of metabolites \\(surfactin, plipastatin, and iturin) on the surface of the living bacterial colonies but is not compatible with desorption methods, such as MALDI, LDI and DESI. A laser ablation electrospray ionization \\(LAESI) MSI setup featuring a confocal distance sensor was introduced recently.<sup>31</sup> The height profile of the sample surface is recorded prior to the MSI experiment and used to guarantee optimal laser focus during the MSI experiment. However, all changes in sample shape and topography after height profiling and during MSI data acquisition are not accounted in this two-step approach. The setup is evaluated with metabolic profiling of radish \\(Raphanus sativus) leaves and their pronounced surface features. We herein present a protocol for the use with an atmospheric pressure MALDI imaging system based on a commercial \u201cAP-SMALDI10\u201d system \\(TransMIT GmbH, Giessen, Germany) additionally equipped with an autofocusing system for 3D surface analysis. This autofocusing AP LDI/MALDI MSI system allows to simultaneously obtain the topography and chemical composition with a lateral resolution of 10 \u00b5m, a depth resolution of </sub>1.5 \u00b5m and a mass resolution of 140.000 at m/z 200 from 3D surfaces with pixel-to-pixel height differences of up to 960 \u00b5m. The resulting mass spectrometric and topographic information are combined to 3D chemical surface maps of sample surfaces or to measure imperfect tissue sections with high lateral resolution."

Second, matrix application by pneumatic spraying is performed and third, autofocusing AP LDI/MALDI MSI measurements are run, followed by data processing, evaluation and visualization \\(**Figure 2**). A daisy blossom \\(_Bellis perennis_) was fixed onto a MALDI target using superglue without any previous preparation steps. Optical images of the daisy blossom sample were recorded by 3D optical microscopy prior to matrix application \\(**Figure 1a**).The daisy blossom was covered with CHCA matrix, and afterwards the matrix layer quality was examined by 3D optical microscopy \\(**Figure 1b**). After matrix layer inspection, the autofocusing AP LDI MSI or MALDI MSI experiment was performed using 30 \u00b5m step size with 183x83 pixels and 1.3 \u00b5J energy per laser pulse. Processing, evaluation and the MS image generation is depicted in **Figure 2**. The topographic data \\(_xyz_) \\(**Figure 2a**) was processed and visualized, using heat map color scheme to show sample topography \\(**Figure 4b**). RGB MS images were generated from the MS dataset using MIRION imaging software, where three specific m/z values were color coded using red, green and blue color channels for visualization of three compound distributions in one RGB MS image \\(**Figure 2c**). In red, \\[D-fructose-phosphate+H]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 261.0374 \\(1.6 ppm mass error) is shown, being exclusively distributed in the green part of the sample. In green, the peptide \\[AlaLeuPheAsp+K]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 503.1903 \\(0.1 ppm mass error) is showing a distribution on the white-red part of the daisy blossom. In blue, the unassigned background signal from the MALDI metal target is shown at m/z 336.9247, visualizing the border of the sample. Finally, the topography image containing the surface information and the chemical composition stored in the RGB MS image are combined into a 3D surface RGB MS image for a combined multi-dimensional data representation \\(**Figure 2e**). The 3D optical microscope image of a fly \\(family: _Drosophilidae_) prior to fixation and matrix application is shown in **Figure 3a**. The fly was fixed on the MALDI target and coated with DHB matrix and subsequently measured with 15 \u00b5m step size, 153x153 pixels and 0.9 \u00b5J energy per laser pulse. The topography image and the combined 3D surface RGB MS image are shown in shown in **Figure 3b** and **Figure 3c**, respectively. The fly\u2019s body has a height of around 330 \u00b5m, whereas the wings only show a very low height in the topography image. **Figure 3c** shows the 3D surface RGB MS image of the ceramide \\[Cer\\(d40:1)+H]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 638.6082 \\(0.1 ppm mass error) in green, which shows high concentrations in cell membranes. The peptide \\[\\(TyrCysGluCys)+H]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 445.1205 \\(1.1 ppm mass error) is shown in red, its distribution correlates with the upper torso region of the fly. The triglyceride \\[TG\\(54:2)+Na]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 909.7864 \\(1.9 ppm mass error) is shown in blue distribution in the lower torso region. In LDI mode \\(without matrix covering) the chemical composition and distribution of a 1-Euro coin was investigated. The optical image of the coin and the measured region of interest are shown in **Figure 4a**. The coin is composed of two alloys, namely a composition of CuZnNi for the outer rim of the coin and CuNi for the inner part. The region of interest was scanned with 20 \u00b5m step size, 235x140 pixels and 2.4 \u00b5J energy per laser pulse. The topography image of the scanned area shows height differences of up to 200 \u00b5m \\(**Figure 4b**). The 3D surface RGB MS image displays three different compounds, in red \\[CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Zn]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 126.9370 \\(1.2 ppm mass error) being exclusively abundant in the outer ring and in green \\[C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OCuNi]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 177.8986 \\(0.2 ppm mass error), present in the inner part of the coin. The organic compound \\[C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>3</sub>+Na]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 189.0525 \\(1.2 ppm mass error) shows a high abundance at the border between the two parts and its origin is possibly human contamination \\(**Figure 4c**)."

In this protocol, we provide the experimental details for surface profiling of three-dimensional \\(3D) objects, i.e. rough surfaces using LDI or MALDI MSI at ambient pressure. This procedure is applicable to various objects, such as inorganic surfaces, intact plants, insects and imperfect tissue sections. We provide a protocol for matrix application, data analysis and data visualization for the use with a high-resolution atmospheric pressure MALDI MSI source. This protocol is intended for 3D sample imaging with down to 10 \u00b5m lateral resolution and about 1.5 \u00b5m height resolution. As an example, various substance classes on plant, insect and coin surfaces were imaged. The data analysis, including MS image generation, generation of topographic images and the combination to a multi-dimensional data visualization are described and discussed in this protocol. Compound assignment is based on accurate mass measurements \\(mass error less than 2 ppm) using a high mass resolution \\(_R_=140.000 at m/z=200) orbital trapping mass spectrometer.",
