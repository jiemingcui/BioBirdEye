            "content": "The activation of sensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans is triggered by calcium entry through calcium channels. As the majority of the neurons in C. elegans probably do not have action potentials through voltage-dependent sodium channels, but rather utilize rapid activation of voltage-gated calcium channels1-4, calcium imaging is a useful technique for measuring neuronal activity2, 5, 6. In particular, genetically encodable calcium indicators such as cameleon and GCaMP are useful for measuring neuronal activity. We recently reported that a pair of sensory neurons, ASJ, in the head of C. elegans negatively regulate temperature habituation-linked cold tolerance7. Most wild-type animals cannot survive at 2\u00b0C for 48 h after cultivation at 20\u201325\u00b0C, while wild-type animals can survive at 2\u00b0C after cultivation at 15\u00b0C. This cold tolerance is established 3 to 5 hours after the cultivation temperature is changed from 25\u201315\u00b0C or 20\u201315\u00b0C. To elucidate the physiological property of thermo-sensory neurons in the formation of temperature experience for temperature tolerance, chronic measurement of neuronal activity is important. In previous reports, however, measurement time of neural activity of thermo-sensory neurons by calcium imaging is only approximately 10 min. In this paper, we describe a detailed protocol for long term calcium imaging for measuring thermo-sensory neurons in C. elegans."

The temperature of the agar pad is controlled by a Peltier-based temperature control system \\(MATS-5500RA-KY; Tokai Hit, Japan). The temperature on the agar pad is monitored by a thermometer connected to a temperature control system. For each imaging experiment, fluorescence intensities are measured using MetaMorph \\(Molecular Device, USA) image analysis system. Relative changes in intracellular calcium concentration are measured as the change in the Acceptor/Donor fluorescence ratio of yellow cameleon protein \\(Ratio Change). All band pass filters for experiments using yellow cameleon are according to previous reports8 9."

Immobilize animal cultivated at 15\u00b0C by 0.1 \u03bcm diameter polystyrene microspheres \\(Polysciences 00876-15; 2.5\u20135% w/v suspension) on 10% \\(w/v) agar pads on glass, then mount the coverslip10. Fill the edge of the coverslip with oil to keep from drying out11. \r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Before this step, set the temperature of thermocontroller at 17\u00b0C. Place the sample slide onto a Peltier-based thermocontroller \\(Tokai Hit, Japan) on the stage of an Olympus IX81. \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Acquire the fluorescence images of YFP and CFP at the initial temperature from 17\u00b0C to 23\u00b0C for 2 min as \u22121- to 0-min states \\(Fig. 1, 2). Use pulsed-illumination excitation blue light for cameleon.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Keep temperature at 23\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n5. After 30 min, acquire the fluorescence images of YFP and CFP for 60 s as the 30-min states\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. After another 30 min, take images for 60 s as the 60-min states\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. After another hour, take images for 60 s as the 120-min states\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. Repeat this operation every 60 min until 300 min.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. After 300 min, turn the temperature down to 17\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\n9. After long-term calcium imaging, the cover glass is removed. Approximately 10 \u03bcl of M9 buffer is added onto the animals, and then animals confirmed to be alive."

We frequently monitored the internal temperature of the incubators and refrigerator using an HA-100K digital thermometer \\(Anritsum, Japan).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBecause temperature is quickly changed by environmental conditions such as air blowing indirectly from air conditioners and other equipment, we used a custom-made microscope cover box made from acrylic board to maintain the temperature near the microscope."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Caenorhabditis elegans has temperature habituation-linked cold tolerance that is controlled by a pair of ASJ temperature sensing neurons in the head. Recent phenotypic analyses showed that temperature experience for cold tolerance can be overwritten within 3\u20135 h after cultivation temperature is altered. Therefore, long-term measurement of neuronal activity of ASJ neurons is considered important to perform quantification analysis in cold tolerance. Here we show a detailed-protocol for long-term imaging of ASJ neuronal activity by using a genetically encoded calcium indicator cameleon.",
