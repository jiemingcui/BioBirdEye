            "content": "This culture system, developed for the induction and selective amplification of neural stem/progenitor cells \\(NSPCs) from embryonic stem \\(ES) cells, allows the systematic characterization of their temporal specification. The use of ES cells in this system enables us to obtain a large number of NSPCs with early temporal identities and to control their regional identity by exposing them to extrinsic signals, recapitulating in vivo central nervous system \\(CNS) development. In this system, primary neurospheres derived from embryoid bodies \\(EBs) differentiate exclusively into neurons, and gliogenesis is activated in subsequent generations of neurospheres. The culture and differentiation assay take approximately 1 month to complete."

The cell density for EB formation should be optimized for each cell line.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step 19a:** The efficiency of neurosphere formation strongly depends on cell density. The appropriate density should be optimized the first time.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step 19b:** Do not use low-adherence culture flasks. Slightly contaminated and surviving non-neural cells adhere to the bottom of the flask and can be removed. If you use low-adherence culture flasks, the neurospheres will be of poor quality and will have difficulty forming the subsequent generations of neurospheres.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step 23:** The number of pipettings depends on the culture stage, since neurospheres become tight with culture time. Primary and secondary neurospheres are soft and dissociate easily, requiring about 10 or fewer pipettings. Too many pipettings would damage and kill the young NSPCs. It is important to use an appropriate number of pipettings to kill differentiating neural cells and contaminating non-neural cells contained in the neurospheres.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step 25:** Differentiation is suppressed under high cell density \\(the appropriate density is 1.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells well<sup>-1</sup>)."

After the EB-dissociated single cells are plated at a density of 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells ml-1 onto non-coated T75 cell culture flasks, they first adhere to the bottom of the flasks. Note that the silencing of a transgene introduced via a retrovirus or lentivirus vector is avoidable by performing the infection at this step or later. After 2-3 days, small growing spheres can be recognized, and the high-quality, undifferentiated neurospheres begin to float in the culture medium. Spheres that may contain many non-neural cells stay adhered to the bottom of the flask, where they grow or differentiate. For differentiation and passage, neurospheres are dissociated using a P1000 Pipetman as follows: Primary neurospheres, 15-20 pipettings; secondary neurospheres, 20-25 pipettings; tertiary neurospheres, 30-35 pipettings. An example of the temporal specification of NSPC differentiative potential is shown in **Figure 1**."
