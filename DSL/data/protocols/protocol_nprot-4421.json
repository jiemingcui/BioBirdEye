            "content": "Extracellular RNAs \\(exRNAs) have been identified in every biofluid that has been tested. They have been found in extracellular vesicles, ribonucleoprotein complexes and lipoprotein complexes. exRNAs are interesting because they may serve as signalling molecules between cells, they have the potential to serve as biomarkers for prediction and diagnosis of disease, and exRNAs or the extracellular particles that carry them might be used for therapeutic purposes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe Sample and Assay Standards Working Group of the Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium \\(ERCC) is a group of laboratories funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health to develop robust and standardized methods for collecting and processing of biofluids, separating different types of exRNA-containing particles and isolating and analyzing exRNAs. In our first joint endeavour, we held a series of conference calls and in-person meetings to survey the methods used among our members, placed them in the context of the current literature and used our findings to identify areas in which the identification of robust methodologies would promote rapid advancements in the exRNA field.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA full list of the protocols developed during this effort is available at the exRNA Portal, the ERCC's website \\( \"http://exrna.org/resources/protocols/\":http://exrna.org/resources/protocols/ ). This protocol for RNA isolation from biofluids using the miRNeasy Micro Kit is one of the RNA isolation methods compared in \"the associated publication\":http://www.journalofextracellularvesicles.net/index.php/jev/article/view/26533."

            "content": "\\(1) The only difference between the micro kit and the serum/plasma kit is the Ce_miR-39 Assay.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(2) Trizol LS is \u201cslightly\u201d more concentrated than standard Trizol or Qiazol, according to a tech note from Life Technologies, allowing a reduction in the ratio of lysis reagent:biofluid. According to the tech note, a ratio of 10:1 Trizol:biofluid can be adjusted to a ratio of 3:1 Trizol LS:biofluid. This may allow processing of larger volumes at one time, but different ratios of these reagent:biofluid have not been rigorously tested.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(3) A spike-in control can be added here.  For example, add 3 \u03bcl of the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Spike-In Control. \\(The manufacturer\u2019s instructions produce a working solution of 1.6 x 108 copies/\u03bcl, so if you add 3 \u03bcl of the Spike-In Control and elute your exRNA in a final volume of 30 \u03bcl, the theoretical concentration of the Spike-In Control in the final exRNA sample would be 1.6 x 107 copies/\u03bcl).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(4) If there is poor phase separation, the original biofluid can be diluted. To \u201crescue\u201d the exRNA preparation, additional buffer, Qiazol and chloroform can be added \\(maintaining the ratio 1:5:1).   \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(5) The manufacturer\u2019s protocol is for 8000 x g, but some labs have found that 1000 x g for the binding step gives better results. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(6) The centrifuge must be above 20\u00b0C so that excessive precipitation does not occur.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(7) 80% ethanol should be prepared with ethanol \\(96\u2013100%) and RNase-free water. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(8) After centrifugation, carefully remove the RNeasy MinElute spin column from the collection tube so that the column does not contact the flow-through. Otherwise, carryover of ethanol will occur. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(9) To avoid damage to their lids, place the spin columns into the centrifuge with at least one empty position between columns. Orient the lids so that they point in a direction opposite to the rotation of the rotor \\(e.g., if the rotor rotates clockwise, orient the lids counterclockwise). It is important to dry the spin column membrane, since residual ethanol may interfere with downstream reactions. Centrifugation with the lids open ensures that no ethanol is carried over during RNA elution.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(10) As little as 10 \u03bcl RNase-free water can be used for elution if a higher RNA concentration is required, but the yield will be reduced by approximately 20%. Do not elute with less than 10 \u03bcl RNase-free water, as the spin column membrane will not be sufficiently hydrated. The dead volume of the RNeasy MinElute spin column is 2 \u03bcl: elution with 14 \u03bcl RNase-free water results in a 12 \u03bcl eluate."
