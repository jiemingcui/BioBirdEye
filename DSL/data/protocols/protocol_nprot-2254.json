            "content": "RECIPIENTS:\r\n\n\n1.Recipient mice \\(Rag2-/- or JH-/-) should be in good health \\(6-10 weeks old). We always sex-match donor and recipients. \r\n\n\n2. Separate mice by groups to irradiate in a container. \r\n  3. Wipe down mouse container from irradiator with antiseptic and place the mice there.\r\n  4. We use a MDS Nordion Gammacell irradiator \\(GC40E). The final dose is 1100 cGy divided in two cycles of 550cGy on the same day.\r\n  3. Take mice back to colony for injection.\r\n  DONOR CELLS: Harvesting bone marrow from donor mice \\(WT, dKO, JH-/-)\r\n\n\n \\(Need at least 1 million cells/recipient)\r\n\n\n1. One mouse \\(4 bones: femurs & tibias) should yield over 40-50 million cells.\r\n  2. Sacrifice donor mouse, spray down with ethanol and remove skin around legs.\r\n  3. Remove leg at hip joint \\(can feel with fingers where to cut).\r\n  4. Remove skin and muscle by cutting skin off and using Kim wipes to \u201crub\u201d off muscle.\r\n  5. Place bones in a well with PBS \\(you can use a sterile 6 well plate or a petri dish).\r\n  6. Continue from now on in a biological safety cabinet and use sterile technique from now on.\r\n  7. Separate femur from tibia/fibula at the knee level. \r\n  8. Place them for a few seconds in a well with 75% of ethanol.\r\n  8. Rinse bones with fresh and sterile PBS twice.\r\n  9. Prepare a 1.5ml eppendorf tube with 200ul of PBS, put a PCR tube with a small hole on the bottom \\(you can use a needle to make the hole) in to the eppendorf tube.\r\n  9. Cut ends of bone off and transfer to new dish containing PBS until it comes time to process them.\r\n  10. Place a femur/tibia together in to the tubes that you prepare on step 9.\r\n  11. Run a short spin in the eppendorf centrifuge to flush bone marrow cells. You will see all the cells in the 200ul of PBS at the bottom of eppendorf tube.\r\n  12. Lyse red blood cells with sterile lysis buffer. \r\n  13. Pass cell suspension through cell strainer to remove large fragments.\r\n  14. Count cells; resuspend them in PBS at a final concentration of 2 million/100ul. 15. For the mixed bone marrow chimeras we need to mix two different donor cells at a defined ratio before injection.\r\n  16. Store on ice until ready to inject.\r\n  INJECTION: Tail vein procedure\r\n\n\n1. Heat the recipient mice up first with the heat lamp until you can see the tail vein, make sure they do not get too hot.\r\n  2. Place mouse into restrainer with tail sticking out. Wipe injection site with alcohol\r\n  3. Inject 100ul cells \\(1 million) i.v. through the tail vein of the recipient mice with a 26 gauge needle. Watch for clearing of vein lumen \\(success). If not in vein, move more proximal until successful. Apply pressure to injection site.\r\n  4. Put them back in to their cages and MAINTAIN THEM ON ANTIOBIOTIC-WATER during two weeks \\(filter 2g/L of Neomycin Sulfate in to water). \r\n  5. Analyze them after at least 6-8 weeks. \r\n  CAUTION: All mixed BM recipients should be generated using the same cohort of recipient mice in order to maintain similar microbiota in the small intestine to be comparable."

Nevertheless, a second cohort of chimeric mice can be important to confirm results \\(see Table. 1b)."
