            "content": "<p>Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction are more common in females than males<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp;The definition of Temporomandibular Dysfunction according to the diagnostic criteria for TMD(DC/TMD) is a discomfort or complaints in muscles( myalgia of TMJ muscles), pain in the Temporomandibular joint (TMJ arthralgia) of functional complaints like clicking and locking of the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) <sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;TMD is historically associated with dental malocclusion<sup>3</sup>. However dentists believe that TMD is related to TMJ clicking and can be best treated by occlusional adjustment or selective grinding<sup>4</sup>. The problems related to TMJ begins early in life the symptoms are not present till adult years<sup>5</sup>. Studies shows that the relation of TMJ pain is associated with the abnormality in the posture of the cervical spine most commonly forward head which leads to class II malocclusion of the stomatognathic system which further lead to Temporomandibular dysfunction<sup>6</sup>. In particular TMJ has a muscular and ligementous connection to the cervical spine forming a functional complex known as \u2018cranio cervical\u2019 \u2013 mandibular system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Forward head is caused by tightness in the sub occipital muscles there is extension at C1 and C2 cervical spine and flexion at C3- C7 cervical spine with leads in tightness of sub occipital muscles<sup>7</sup>. The patient presentation of forward head includes significant mandibular retrusion, mandibular size deficiency. The sub occipital muscles consists of rectus capitis posterior major and minor, obliqus capitis superior and inferior. A report suggest that the occurrence of trigger point in sub occipital muscles was more as compared to other cervical muscle in patient with TMD<sup>8</sup>. The TMJ dysfunction mostly occurs because of any injury to jaw, overuse of muscles or inflammatory condition like arthritis, and bruxism the symptoms includes headache, limited mouth opening, &nbsp;muscle spasm, tinnitus, fullness in ears, cervical spine dysfunction and altered craniovertebral angle seen as forward head posture<sup>9</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conventional Physiotherapy treatments used to treat forward head include postural correction exercises and stretching exercise, manual therapy along with hot fermentation are given to reduce pain, improve range of motion, reduced muscle spasm and tightness, improve strength, and breaking down adhesion and enhance patient condition<sup>10</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The fascia is ubiquitous covering soft tissue and organ. Tightening of the fascias a histological, physiologic and biomechanics protective mechanism that occurs in response to trauma or faulty alignment, the fascia solidifies and loses its resilience. Myofacial release is a hands on soft tissue technique that facilitates a stretch into restricted fascia. A sustained pressure is applied on the tissue for 90-120 seconds post that the tissue will undergo histological length changes allowing first release to be felt. The same procedure is repeated in the new tissue barrier. After few Myofacial release sessions the tissue will take the pressure off the pressure sensitive structure like blood vessels, Nerves, along with restoring the alignment and mobility of the joint<sup>11</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A study is done on upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, temporalis and masseter to find out the effect of Myofacial release on this muscles. No such study is done on sub occipital muscle so the need of the study is to compare Myofacial Release Technique and Conventional Physiotherapy on mild to moderate temporomandibular dysfunction with neck pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The aim of the study is to find the efficacy of Sub occipital Myofacial Release technique (MFR) on Functional Disability in patients with &nbsp;mild to moderate Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction with Neck Pain.</p><p><br></p>"

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is one of commonest joint that gets affected in females, studies shows that the altered posture of cervical spine lead to mandibular retrusion and hence in long term leads to Temporomandibular dysfunction, the tightness of sub-occipital muscle leads to pulling of the ligaments around the joint in course causing retrusion or malocclusion. The common symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction includes clicking, reduced mouth opening, headache. Alteration in the function of TMJ leads to poor quality of life of the individual as this joint is involved in basic activities like talking, eating, laughing and kissing. The sub-occipital muscles are the group of muscle extending from spinous process of C2 vertebrae to inferior nuchal line of occipital bone. Tightness of this muscle lead to extension of upper cervical spine and flexion of lower cervical spine. The common causes of temporomandibular dysfunction includes injury to jaw, overuse, inflammatory condition like arthritis and bruxism. Our aim is to find out the efficacy of sub-occipital Myofacial Release versus conventional physiotherapy on functional disability of TMJ. The clinical trial registry-India(CTRI) registration number for this trial is CTRI/2021/05/033493.</p>",
