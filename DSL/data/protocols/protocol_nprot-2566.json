            "content": "Insect research including  population  genetics ,taxonomic and evolutionary field always invite  molecular techniques .Molecular techniques  followed  good quality protocols like DNA extraction from a large number of samples in terms of  time , money and equipment access. Several methods of DNA extraction have been published using Chelex-100, Sarcosil with Proteinase K, CTAB, Polyvinyal pyrolidone and mercaptoethanol ,Only CTAB ,CTAB with mercaptoethanol ,CTAB with SDS, DIGSOL buffer etc.1,2,3. A non destructive DNA extraction procedure have great potential on insect specimen rather than a destructive and time consuming protocol 4 .A universal and rapid salt of high quality genomic  DNA extraction method was used to perform hundreds of pcr based reactions 5 .\r\n\n\nDNA extraction at room temperature prevent DNA degradation and is suitable for polymerase chain reaction using EDTA , Proteinase K and Guanidinium thiocyanate 6 . Most commercial insect DNA extraction kits \\(Merk , prep G, DNeasy kit, Qiagen, Germany EM, Charge Switch and Aquapur DNA extraction kits ) are not cost effective and involve use of expensive laboratory equipments. We developed a simple and very efficient DNA isolation protocol  from mosquito species for pcr related works in our laboratory."

The protocol involves three steps like lysis, phenol : chloroform \\(1:1) extraction  and  two fold isopropanol precipitation at -20 degree celcius using 1X  STE buffer \\(50mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-Hcl,100mM EDTA,PH 8.0).The proposed extraction protocol has an advantage of  DNA extraction from  mosquitoes  using 1X STE buffer at 37\u00bacelcius which prevent DNA degradation at higher temperature and  kept DNA stability in long term storage . The protocol proved by three different mosquito species and removing for potential contamination showed that the protocol yields good quantity and quality DNA, typically better than commercial kits .The protocol was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction \\(PCR). The protocol of DNA extraction is a time saving as well as economies with available laboratory chemicals, consumables and basic equipments. The protocol is adoptable  for  laboratories  in external and internal  funded research projects with large  numbers  of mosquito samples  in a small period .The protocol minimize the time for other DNA extraction protocols in  two to three days  and provides a workflow for mapping of malaria vectors ,their  vectorial transmission in the area of translational research .",
