            "content": "Intercellular chemical transmission is mediated by various types of molecules including peptide hormones and neuropeptides which are important messengers in the regulation of homeostatic functions and behavior \\(1). Peptide messengers are quite different from the classical neurotransmitters such as catecholamines, GABA or glutamate. Some distinguishing features include peptide extrasynaptic release, absence of reuptake and the nanomolar affinity for their receptors which belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family \\(2). High affinity receptor binding of peptides determines the specificity of peptide action on each receptor subtype which may depend on peptide length and posttranslational modifications. In fact, after release, peptide messengers are quickly degraded by various enzymes present in plasma and extracellular space \\(3). Furthermore, peptide hormones released in the systemic circulation must travel long distances before reaching their target tissues, e.g. ghrelin released from stomach has its targets in the brain and other distant organs and tissues \\(4). These features of peptidergic signaling imply that biological action of peptides should depend on preservation of their intact structures. The cumulative evidence indicate that immunoglobulins \\(Ig) may play a role of natural carrier molecules for neuropeptides and, hence, may constitutively participate in peptidergic signaling \\(5,6). Indeed, neuropeptide-reactive IgG are ubiquitously present in humans and rodents without exogenous antigenic stimulation \\(7). In the associated publication we showed that plasma IgG protect peptide hormone ghrelin from degradation by plasma enzymes, thereby, preserving peptide biological activities \\(8). Furthermore, differences in IgG affinities for peptide hormones can change peptide carrier properties resulting in enhancement or in diminishment of peptide biological activities. For instance, increased IgG affinities for ghrelin, an orexigenic hormone, was associated with increased appetite in patients with obesity. In contrast, increased dissociation rates of IgG for ghrelin were found in patients with anorexia nervosa \\(8). Another example is a decreased association rate of plasma IgG binding to adrenocorticotropic hormone which was found in male adolescents with antisocial behavior \\(9). Thus, analysis of affinity kinetics of human or animal plasma IgG binding to a specific peptide hormone may provide useful information towards understanding of individual variability in peptidergic signaling impacting on physiology and behavior and may help to develop new therapeutic approaches. In this protocol we describe the procedure of IgG purification from plasma adapted for its further use for affinity kinetic analysis with the surface plasmon resonance of IgG binding to peptide hormones."

Or you can use aprotinine tubes which already contain protease inhibitor.\r\n\n\nb) Centrifuge blood sample at 3000 rpm during 20 min at 4\u00b0C.\r\n\n\nc) Collect the plasma and acidify it with HCl 1N to prevent peptide degradation. HCl volume represents 10% of the plasma volume.\r\n\n\n2. Peptide protein separation \\(to separate peptides from IgG)\r\n  a) Add 1 mL of acetonitrile 60% in TFA 1% in Strata\u00ae C18-SEP columns and centrifuge at 3000 rpm during 3 min at 4\u00b0C to activate the column.\r\n\n\nb) Wash three times with 3 mL of TFA 1%.\r\n\n\nc) Add your plasma previously diluted at \u00bd with TFA 1% \\(500 \u00b5L plasma and 500 \u00b5L TFA 1%). During plasma loading, peptides are bound to the column and proteins go into the effluent.\r\n\n\nd) Keep the effluent at -80\u00b0C to purify IgG from this plasma fraction. Optionally peptides can be eluted for their concentration assay with following steps.\r\n\n\ne) Wash twice with 3 mL of TFA 1%.\r\n\n\nf) Elute peptides with acetonitrile 60% in TFA 1%.\r\n\n\ng) Evaporate the eluent 15 min with a SpeedVac concentrator to eliminate the maximum of acetonitrile.\r\n\n\nh) Freeze eluent and lyophilize during 72 h.\r\n\n\ni) Resuspend peptide fraction with PBS and assay the purified peptide using the appropriate kits.\r\n\n\n3. IgG purification \r\n  a) Add 500 \u00b5L Melon Gel purification support in mini spin columns and centrifuge at 5000 rpm 30 s.\r\n\n\nb) Wash twice with 300 \u00b5L purification buffer and centrifuge at 5000 rpm 30 s.\r\n\n\nc) Dilute effluent-containing IgG from previous step at \u00bc with purification buffer \\(1 mL effluent and 3 mL purification buffer).\r\n\n\nd) Add 500 \u00b5L of diluted sample on the column and incubate 5 min at room temperature on roller mixer.\r\n\n\ne) Centrifuge at 5000 rpm 30 s to purify IgG.\r\n\n\nf) Repeat step d and e until you finish to pass all the diluted sample on the column.\r\n\n\ng) Pool the entire fraction that you obtain in a hemolysis tube to freeze and lyophilize during 72 h.\r\n\n\nh) After lyophilization resuspend your purified IgG with a volume of BIAcore HBS-EP buffer corresponding to the plasma volume at the beginning to the experiment.\r\n\n\ni) Determine IgG concentration using a nanodrop or a similar device.\r\n\n\n4. Afinity kinetics assay in BIAcore\r\n  Fix the peptide of interest on BIAcore CM5 chip using the BIAcore amine coupling kit.\r\n\n\nA) Peptide Coating\r\n\n\na) Open the BIAcore control software and place a new CM5 chip in the BIAcore or one with a free flowcell \\(command \u2192 undock \u2192 change the chip \u2192 dock \u2192 prime to wash the chip).\r\n\n\nb) Mix 100 \u00b5L of NHS and 100 \u00b5L of EDC and place the tube in position R2A1 in the BIAcore.\r\n\n\nc) Dilute the peptide in acetate buffer at 0.5 mg/mL and place the tube in R2A2 position.  The ideal volume is 200 \u00b5L of diluted peptide to repeat injection during the coating in case there is not enough peptide fixed on the chip with a single injection.\r\n\n\nd) Place 200 \u00b5L of ethanolamine in R2A3 position and a complete vial of NaOH 10 mM in R2F3 position.\r\n\n\ne) To start the coating you have to start a new sensorgram \\(run \u2192 run a new sensorgram \u2192 choose the flowcell \u2192 flow at 5 \u00b5L/min \u2192 sensorgram will start).\r\n\n\nf) The flowcell needs to be activated before the peptide injection using NHS/EDC mix injection \\(command \u2192 inject \u2192 volume: 35 \u00b5L \u2192 position: R2A1).\r\n\n\ng) After the activation, the peptide can be fixed on the chip \\(command \u2192 inject \u2192 volume: 35 \u00b5L \u2192 position: R2A2). You can repeat this injection if there is not enough peptide fixed on the chip.\r\n\n\nh) After the peptide injection, you have to fix it on the chip using ethanolamine injection \\(command \u2192 inject \u2192 volume: 35 \u00b5L \u2192 position: R2A3).\r\n\n\ni) After coating you can regenerate once or twice with NaOH 10 mM to take down peptide not correctly fixed \\(command \u2192 inject \u2192 volume: 10 \u00b5L \u2192 position: R2F3). Stop the sensorgram and save it \\(run \u2192 stop sensorgram) \\(figure 1).\r\n\n\nB) Affinity kinetics determination method\r\n\n\na) Dilute IgG using HBS-EP buffer and place them in the correct position.

The program will start with a wash \\(prime) of the system with HBS-EP buffer. After this wash you can insert your sample in the BIAcore and click on continue.\r\n\n\nc) The program will start with 2 startup with HBS-EP buffer to see derive of the signal. Then the automate will save a sensorgram for each concentration. At the end, there are 10 sensorgram for one sample \\(2 startup + 8 concentrations).\r\n\n\nC) Results analysis\r\n\n\na) Open BIAevaluation software for the result analysis. Then open the file corresponding to the sample that you want to analyze.\r\n\n\nb) Select the first and the second curves corresponding to the 2 startup to check if they are similar. Then open the 2 blank curves and just keep one for the analysis. Idem for the concentration 840 nM \\(there are still 6 curves for the analysis).\r\n\n\nc) Delete the extreme parts of the curves from 0 to 80 seconds and from 535 to 900 seconds \\(edit \u2192 select \u2192 0 to 80 \u2192 edit \u2192 cut \u2192\u2192 repeat this action for 535 to 900 seconds).\r\n\n\nd) Delete artifact peaks which may be interacting with the analysis \\(select the curve and open it \u2192 select the peak area with the right click \u2192 edit \u2192 cut).\r\n\n\ne) Line up the curves to 0 \\(select and open all the resting curves \u2192 select a part of the curves at the beginning in the linear part \u2192 Y-transform \u2192 0 at the average of the selection \u2192 replace curves).\r\n\n\nf) Subtract the blank curve from the others \\(Y-transform \u2192 delete a curves to the other \u2192 select the number correspond to the blank curve \u2192 add as new).\r\n\n\ng) Fit the curves to obtain kinetic parameters: ka, kd, KD, KA \\(fit \u2192 simultaneous ka/kd \u2192 Langmuir binding model 1:1 \u2192 enter the correct concentration for each curve \u2192 fit).\r\n\n\nh) You can copy it on an Excel for statistical analysis \\(select the table \u2192 Ctrl+C \u2192 paste on Excel)."

Because the IgG set of each individual is unique, measuring affinity kinetics of human or animal plasma IgG binding to a specific peptide hormone may provide useful information towards understanding of individual variability in peptidergic signaling. Here, we describe a protocol of IgG preparation from human blood samples adapted for the analysis of affinity kinetics binding between IgG and peptide hormones measured by the surface plasmon resonance. The same protocol can be also applied to analyze IgG in rodents.",
