The methodology is based on a template \\(_acceptor_) library, SWAT-GFP, which can be \u201cswapped\u201d into any other library of choice. Using the \u201ctemplate library\u201d of strains, in which an acceptor module with a GFP was integrated into a different gene in each strain \\(at the N\u2019 terminus), one can easily create any other yeast collection with their desired genomic modification or tag inserted into each ORF at the N\u2019. The method relies on the Synthetic Genetic Array \\(SGA) procedures to cross the SWAT library with a _donor_ strain. The donor strain harbors the desired module to be inserted on a donor plasmid, and an inducible I-SceI restriction enzyme that facilitates high efficiency of swapping. The SWAT methodology is easy and fast, highly efficient and accurate. It enables any lab to create their own \u201ctailor made\u201d strain collection in a matter of a few weeks."

            "header": "Procedure",
            "content": "**Summary**\r\n\n\nFirst, the desired genomic modification must be cloned into a donor plasmid. This plasmid should then be transformed into a SWAT donor strain, which already contains the SGA procedure genetic traits, and is compatible with the SWAT method as it harbors a galactose induced I-SceI. Once introduced with the donor plasmid the donor strain is crossed with the SWAT library, and the following steps of the SGA process are performed: mating, diploid selection, sporulation, haploid selection and double-mutant selection. At this point, swapping of the desired module into the genome is induced by replicating the double mutant plates onto galactose containing media. Finally, selection for positively swapped yeast is performed by 5-FOA \\(negative selection for the SWAT acceptor module), and/or by a selection marker introduced with the donor module.\n**1. Donor module plasmid cloning \\(~ 7 days)**\r\n\n\nThe donor plasmid is a yeast shuttle vector and must contain the following features:\r\n\n\n\\(Note: All of the below instructions are for N\u2019-tag swapping with the available SWAT-GFP library)\r\n\n\nA. Bacterial origin of replication and selection marker, for maintenance and plasmid production.\r\n\n\nB. Yeast centromere and autonomously replicating sequence \\(CEN-ARS).\r\n\n\n\u2022 This feature ensures a low-copy number of the plasmid per cell, helping avoid a possible problem of non-cut plasmid after SceI induction, and recombination between copies of donor plasmids. \r\n\n\nC. Yeast selection marker.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Possible common markers that can be used are: KAN, NAT, MET, and Bleomycin. \\(Hygromycin may be used if not used as the swap selection).\r\n\n\n\u2022 Markers that cannot be used, as they are utilized as SGA markers are: URA \\(the SWAT library marker), HIS, LEU, LYS, and ARG, as well as the CAN1 and LYP1 transporters.\r\n\n\nD. Two SceI sites, directly up- and downstream of the swap module.\r\n\n\n\u2022 The I-SceI site sequence is \\(restriction site alone underlined) : \r\n\n\n5\u2019 agttacgctagggataacagggtaatatag 3'.\r\n\n\nE. Two recombination sequences, homologous to regions in the SWAT module flanking the SWAT module SceI site. These can be any combination of the following:\nSee figure in Figures section.\nF. Optional \u2013 selection marker.\nSee figure in Figures section.\nG. The desired genomic modification. This may be either a promoter, a promoter and a tag, or any other regulatory element \\(protein coding or other). \r\n\n\n\u2022 One can also introduce a tag at the 5\u2019 end, to be driven by each gene\u2019s native promoter, and another promoter + tag at the 3\u2019 end, to be fused to each protein.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Proteins containing regulatory features at their 5\u2019 end were tagged downstream to these features with a SWAT module which has a generic feature in exchange \\(such as signal peptides). Therefore, non-seamless swapping donor plasmids should contain another version of these features as well \\(such as a different signal peptide), and introduced separately to assemble a donor strain to be crossed with this subset of strains of the SWAT library.\r\n\n\nTo ease the cloning of donor plasmids, several template plasmids were prepared by us and are freely available. These plasmids contain all the features above, and should only be modified by insertion of the desired genomic modification to be introduced instead of the SWAT tag in the library. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe plasmids do not contain multiple cloning sites and therefore we highly recommend using either restriction free \\(RF) cloning \\(Unger et al., 2010) or Gibson assembly \\(Gibson et al., 2009) to perform plasmid cloning steps, and to sequence the entirety of the swap module \\(sequence between and including both SceI sites) before testing the cloned constructs.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2. SWAT donor strain preparation \\(~5 days)**\r\n\n\nOnce prepared, the donor plasmid should now be transformed into a SWAT donor template strain using the standard Saccharomyces cerevisiae PEG/LiAC transformation protocol \\(Gietz and Woods, 2002). As detailed in the table below, the template strain \\(yMS2085) has the following traits: his3\u22061 leu2\u22060 met15\u22060 ura3\u22060 LYS2+ can1\u2206::GAL1pr-SceI::STE2pr-SpHIS5 lyp1\u2206::STE3pr-LEU2.\r\n\n\nIf you wish to screen for additional genetic traits across the entire library \\(an additional fluorescent reporter, gene deletion, etc.), they may be incorporated into the genome of the donor strain at this stage. For example, one may wish to incorporate a reporter for glycosylation into each protein represented in the library, and also test this reporter on the background of a deletion in one of the genes participating in this process. Therefore this gene should be deleted in the donor strain prior to the beginning of its SGA with the SWAT library.\r\n\n\nSWAT donor template strain traits\nSee figure in Figures section.\n**3. Donor plasmid verification \\(~7 days)**\r\n\n\nBefore continuing to perform high-throughput experiments, it is advisable to test swapping capability of the cloned donor plasmid on a few strains. The test strains have the same traits as the SWAT donor template strain \\(see above), with the addition of a SWAT acceptor module introduced into the genome, tagging a different protein in each strain. These testing strains are provided with the library, or can be made by tagging of specific proteins with the SWAT module \\(plasmid pST-N2). The genotype for these strains is \\(HMG1 as an example): SWAT-GFP-HMG1 ; can1\u2206::GAL1pr-SceI::STE2pr-SpHIS5 ; lyp1\u2206::STE3pr-LEU2 ; his3\u22061 ; leu2\u22060 met15\u22060 ; ura3\u22060 ; LYS2+.\r\n\n\nFollow these steps to assure the donor plasmid functionality:\r\n\n\n1. Transform the donor plasmid into the test donor strains, using the selection found in the donor plasmid \\(see 1.C). Incubate at 30\u00b0c for 2-3 days, according to the transformation protocol.\r\n  2. Pick a few single colonies from each transformation, and patch them onto a fresh selection plate. Incubate at 30\u00b0c for 1-2 days.\r\n  3. Either pick and re-patch or replica plate \\(using a velvet cloth) the yeast onto plates containing 2% galactose media \\(YPGal). Incubate at 30\u00b0c for 1-2 days. Repeat this induction step another time.\r\n  \u2022 Save the plates from the previous step for comparison later on.\r\n\n\n4. Either pick and re-patch or replica plate the yeast onto plates containing one of the following selection media:\nSee figure in Figures section.\nIncubate at 30\u00b0c for 1-2 days.\r\n\n\nRepeat this selection step another time.\r\n\n\n5. Repeat step 4, for another selection round. Refresh yeast from step 2.\r\n  6. Perform an experiment that enables testing the swapping of the donor module, comparing yeast before \\(step 2) and after \\(step 5) swapping. This may include a Validation by PCR, visualization of fluorescent tags, etc.\r\n  \u2003\r\n\n\n**4. SGA of SWAT library with SWAT donor and tag swap \\(~21 days)**\r\n\n\nOnce the SWAT donor strain is ready it should be crossed with the SWAT library, creating haploid, double-mutant yeast. We highly recommend using the Singer RotorHD colony arrayer to preform high-throughput library plate manipulation \\(transferring of yeast from one selection media to another, manual pinners can also be used \\(V&P scientific)).\r\n\n\nA complete description of the SGA method is published in numerous manuscripts \\(Tong et al., 2001), and a full protocol was previously published by us \\(Cohen and Schuldiner, 2011).\nSee figure in Figures section.\nAt each step, an extra plate with the same media should be used to test growth of strains from previous steps as a control for the selection used. For example:\r\n\n\n\u2022 The diploid selection media \\(#4) should be tested with the original donor strain and several colonies from the library array \\(before mating). \r\n\n\n\u2022 At SceI induction \\(#13), the original donor strain and strains from the library should be plated, and then transferred to the Swap selection \\(#14) to verify that they do not grow \\(as swapping doesn\u2019t occur in the library, and the donor plasmid should be cut in the donor).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**5. New library swap verification \\(Timing varies by validation assay)**\r\n\n\nValidation of correct swapping events can be performed in various methods, depending on the type of swap and type of tag introduced.\r\n\n\nA. The SWAT libraries contain 3 control strains, each placed in multiple repeats per each 384 well plate. In addition, there are blank locations without any colonies.\r\n\n\na. Check that the blank locations did not get contaminated during plate replication at the various stages.\nSee figure in Figures section.\nB. PCR analysis can be performed, using swapped and original colonies. Primers should be planned to test both the presence of the new tag in the yeast genome, and to make sure no non-swapped yeast remain. We recommend using the following PCR reactions after swap of the N\u2019 SWAT-GFP libraries:\nSee figure in Figures section.\n* Depending on the tag used.\nSee figure in Figures section.\nC. Functional analysis should be performed on positive and negative control gene colonies, based on the introduced module. This may also be performed after streaking of the swapped colonies to single colonies, to assess percent of swapped vs. non-swapped clones."

The donor strain encodes a galactose induced I-SceI and harbors a donor plasmid with the desired tag flanked by two generic sequences (L1, L2) and two SceI restriction sites for systematic insertion (top left). An SGA procedure is used to create the new library and includes mating of the SWAT \u2013GFP arrays with the donor strain, followed by a diploid selection step. Diploids are induced to sporulate, and thereafter haploids are selected for using the unique SGA markers. Next, selection is made for double mutants that contain both the acceptor tagged locus and the donor plasmid and I-SceI locus. At this point, I-SceI expression is induced by a growth step on galactose, leading to double strand breaks in the tagged gene locus and the donor plasmid. The genomic break is mended by homologous recombination of the donor tag (top middle). Correct swapping is selected for and a library featuring the new tag is created (top right).\r\nSeveral types of tag swaps can be carried out by using various designs of donor plasmid features, which result in several types of tagged-gene libraries (indicated by the Swap arrow). The possible swap donor types include: (1) Seamless tag swap in which proteins are fused to a new tag, restoring the native regulatory features (promoter and/or signal peptide), (2) Selection reconstitution tag swap in which a new tag is introduced with a common regulatory features (e.g. a specific promoter), and the Hygromycin selection marker is reconstituted, (3) Selection and tag swap in which both a new tag as well as a new selection marker are introduced, and (4) Seamless GFP swap in which proteins are still fused to the GFP tag, while restoring their native regulatory features (promoter and/or signal peptide).\r\n",

To extensively increase the number of such libraries and the types of information that can be gleaned from them, we have recently devised an approach, termed SWAp-Tag \\(SWAT). SWAT relies on a parental library to rapidly, easily and efficiently create additional collections. In this protocol we describe how to use the genome wide SWAT parental library to generate any tagged library of choice.",
