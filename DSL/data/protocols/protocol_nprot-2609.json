            "content": "NK cells are important effectors of the innate immune system, and the cytotoxic function of NK cells is crucial to many processes such as defending against pathogens and tumors<sup>1, 2</sup>. In vitro, human NK cells can differentiate from bone marrow- or cord blood-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells in appropriate culture conditions. In early studies, NK-cell development from purified HSC was shown to be stromal-cell dependent <sup>3</sup>. It has later been demonstrated that the stromal-cell requirements may be replaced by the provision of combined cytokines such as SCF, Flt3-L and IL-15 to the cultures<sup>4</sup>. In particular, SCF and Flt3-L directly induce the expression of IL-2 receptor-\u03b2chain on HSC, thereby rendering them susceptible to the NK-cell commitment induced by IL-15<sup>5</sup>. Recently, a number of different cytokine combinations have been tested for their ability to support the proliferation and differentiation of human CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells \\(HSCs) into mature NK cells. However, a cytokine that has not been extensively studied in this regard is insulin-like growth factor \\(IGF)-1. IGF-1, also known as somatomedin C, is one of the main endocrine mediators of growth and development under physiological conditions<sup>6</sup>. In addition to this important function, IGF-1 also regulates the hematopoiesis and direct effector functions of diverse aspects of cells of the innate and acquired immune systems. In this study, we found that IGF-1 may foster the IL-15-induced NK differentiation of human umbilical cord blood \\(UCB) CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.\r\n\n\nHere, we described an improved protocol based on combined cytokines \\(SCF, Flt3-L, IL-15 and IGF-1) culture for ex vivo expansion of highly lytic NK cells from human UCB/CD34<sup>+</sup> cells."

Collect fresh cord blood \\(typically 60\u201380 ml samples) from the umbilical cords of the placentas of normal, full-term, non-stressed newborns of consenting mothers.\r\n  2. Cord blood samples were diluted 1:2 in PBS. Cord blood mononuclear cells \\(CBMC) were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation at 400 g for 30 minutes using standard procedures and washed extensively in PBS.\r\n  \u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Ensure that the cells were processed within 4 h of collection.\r\n\n\n3. Isolate CD34\n+\ncells from CBMCs with the Miltenyi human CD34 Microbead Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions \\(Miltenyi Biotec). \r\n  \u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Cell purity analysis by FACS, purity should be routinely higher than 90%.\r\n\n\n4. Determine the number of the CD34\n+\ncells by gently mixing 10 \u03bcl of the above isolated cells with 80 \u03bcl of PBS and 10 \u03bcl of Trypan Blue. Use a Neubauer chamber to count the number of viable \\(not stained) CD34\n+\ncells.\r\n  5. The isolated CD34\n+\ncells were cultured in warm SCGM supplemented with 100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin and 10% FBS in the presence of recombinant human SCF \\(30 ng/ml), Flt3-L \\(50 ng/ml), IL-15 \\(50 ng/ml) and IGF-1 \\(100 ng/ml).\r\n  \u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Depending on the cell number of the starting population \\(5\u00d710\n4\ncells or 1\u00d710\n5\ncells per culture), cultures were grown in 0.1 or 1.0 ml medium in 96- or 24-well culture plates, respectively. \r\n\n\n6. The cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 4 weeks. \r\n  \u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Every 3\u20134 days, half of the medium volume was replaced with fresh medium containing the same concentration of freshly added cytokines. Cell density was thereby adjusted to 1\u00d710\n6\ncells/ ml in 6-well culture plates. \r\n\n\n7\uff0eTotal number of viable cells differentiated from CD34\n+\ncells by various cytokine combinations, as counted for up to 4 weeks.\r\n\n\n8. At day 28, collect cells, the percentage of CD3\n-\nCD56\n+\ncells was measured by FACS analysis.\r\n  9. NK cell function was evaluated through flow cytometry monitoring of perforin and CD107a expression. \r\n  \\(1) For perforin assay: Intracellular staining for perforin was performed following\r\n\n\nsurface staining for CD56\n+\nCD3\nneg\ncells \\(to identify NK cells). Stained cells were fixed and permeabilized with the Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit \\(BD Pharmingen), as detailed in manufacturers\u2019 instructions: \r\n\n\na. Thoroughly resuspend cells with 250 \u03bcl of BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution in the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and incubate for 20 min. at 4\u00b0C.\r\n\n\nb. Wash cells two times in 1 ml BD Perm/Wash buffer.\r\n\n\nc. Thoroughly resuspend fixed/permeabilized cells in 50 \u03bcl of BD Perm/Wash buffer containing a predetermined optimal concentration of a PE-conjugated anti-perforin Ab or appropriate negative control. Incubate at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes in the dark.\r\n\n\nd. Wash cells 2 times with BD Perm/Wash buffer and resuspend in staining buffer and then analyzed by flow cytometry.\r\n\n\n\\(2) For CD107a assay, the cytokine-differentiated NK cells were isolated, then 2\u00d710\n5\nNK cells and 2\u00d710\n5\ncells of the erythroleukemia cell line K562 \\(American Type Culture Collection) were mixed by gentle pipetting, spun down for 1 min at 200 g, and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in 200 \u00b5l of SCGM media. NK cells were then stained with an Alexa-647-labeled anti-CD56-Ab, PE-Cy5-labeled anti-CD3-Ab, and degranulation was detected with a PE-labeled anti-CD107a-Ab \\(all Abs from BD Biosciences)."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "A number of different cytokine combinations have been tested for their ability to support the proliferation and differentiation of human CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells \\(HSC) into mature NK cells. Here, we describe an improved protocol based on multiple cytokines \\(SCF, Flt3-L, IL-15 and IGF-1) culture for obtaining a high number of lytic NK cells from human umbilical cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.More than 6 x 10<sup>7</sup> highly lytic NK cells can be obtained from 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> fresh CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC using this protocol. This facilitates the use of the above culture system as a tool for researchers to study the development, properties and functions of NK cells in vitro, and this procedure also facilitates cellular adoptive immunotherapy by providing sufficient numbers of highly enriched CD3<sup>-</sup> CD56<sup>+</sup> effector cells with highly cytotoxic potential.",
