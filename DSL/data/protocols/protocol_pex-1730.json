Subsequent steps were carried out away from light. Slides were submerged in lysis buffer (2.25 M NaCl, 115 mM EDTA, 9 mM Tris, 10% DMSO, 1% Triton X-100, NaOH to pH 10) for 2 h at room temperature, washed 3x with enzyme buffer (40 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 200 mg/L BSA, KOH to pH 8), then treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (New England Biolabs, UNG 0.1 unit/slide diluted in enzyme buffer) or enzyme buffer only for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Slides were denatured in electrophoresis buffer (1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH) for 30 min at room temperature, then subjected to 25 V and 300 mA for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C in a comet assay tank (Thistle Scientific), and followed by incubation in neutralization buffer (400 mM Tris, HCl to pH 7.5) for 45 min at room temperature. For image acquisition, slides were stained with SYBR\u00ae Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (ThermoFisher) and visualized at 488 nm and 10x magnification using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 inverted fluorescence microscope.

Enzymatic activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 340\u2009nm by monitoring the absorbance change during the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to dihydrofolate using a Hidex Sense plate reader. Measurements were carried out at room temperature in a buffer of 50\u2009mM Tris at pH 7.5 and 150\u2009mM NaCl. Initial reaction rates were measured with 50\u2009nM of purified protein, 250\u2009\u03bcM 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and 100\u2009\u03bcM dUMP in the presence of compounds (100 \u00b5M) using the same amount of DMSO as in control.

Tracer medium was supplemented with 400 \u03bcM glycine, 2 mM glutamine, 17 mM glucose, 400 \u03bcM [U-\n13\nC]-serine tracer, 1% P/S, and 5 % FBS. 300,000 HL-60 cells were seeded in 12-well plates in triplicates for each experimental condition in 1 ml RPMI tracer medium, treated as indicated, and cultured for 24 h. Residual cell seeding solution was counted and cell size was determined to calculate packed cell volume (PCV) of total cells in pL at the start of each tracing experiment. After 24 h, triplicate wells per condition were counted and cell size was determined to calculate PCV at the end of the tracing experiment. All following steps for metabolite extraction were carried out on ice. First, medium of all conditions in triplicates was collected by centrifugation. To be able to determine the basal medium composition, tracer medium without cells was incubated in parallel throughout the experiment in triplicates in 12 wells. All collected media were centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min to remove residual cellular debris. Supernatant was collected and stored at -20 \u00b0C to allow for subsequent analysis of formate exchange rates from the medium. Formate extraction, derivatization, and quantification was performed using GC-MS analysis as previously described\n28\n. For intracellular metabolite extraction after [U-\n13\nC]-serine tracing, pelleted HL-60 cells were washed with 1 ml cold PBS and subsequently resuspended in 400 \u03bcl ice-cold extraction solvent (5:3:2 MeOH/ACN/H\n2\nO). Intracellular metabolites were extracted by shaking at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. After a final centrifugation, supernatant was collected, stored at -80 \u00b0C, and submitted to LC-MS analysis of intracellular metabolite labeling. LC-MS analysis of nucleotides was detailed in BioRxiv Preprint Kiweler\net al.\n2021 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.27.445928).\nGenomic 2\u2019-deoxyuridine (dU) measurements.\nCells were lysed by passing through 21G and 23G syringe needles and subsequent incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with 1000 RPM shaking in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 100 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL proteinase K (Worthington Biochemical), 0.1 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 \u03bcM tetrahydrouridine (THU, Merck Millipore). DNA was subsequently extracted from the lysates with 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, followed by two washes with 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and isopropanol precipitation using 10 M ammonium acetate to precipitate the DNA. RNA and free nucleotides were then removed from the DNA samples by treatment with 4 \u03bcg RNase A in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.0), 10 mM MgCl\n2\nfor 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by a subsequent isopropanol precipitation. Next, the DNA samples were hydrolyzed and dephosphorylated to single nucleosides as previously described (Galashevskaya, A. et al.\u00a0DNA Repair. 2013 Sep;12(9):699-706.\u00a0doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2013.05.002). DNA was hydrolyzed to nucleosides by treatment with 0.8 U Nuclease P1 (Sigma-Aldrich), 80 U Benzonase\u00ae Nuclease (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 7.5 U Antarctic Phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in 50 \u03bcl reactions containing 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 5.5), 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1 mM ZnCl\n2\nand 240 \u03bcM THU for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C. Enzymes were then precipitated and removed from the reactions by adding three volumes of ice-cold acetonitrile to the reactions, incubating for 10 min on ice, centrifugation at 16,000 RCF for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and lyophilized until dry. To separate dU from dC, the samples were redissolved in water and fractionated on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system (with a UV detector set to 260 nm to identify the canonical nucleosides) and a mixed mode Primesep 200 column (2.1 mm x 150 mm, 5 \u03bcm, SieLC) kept at 30 \u00b0C using a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and water and acetonitrile as mobile phase, each containing 0.1% formic acid, as the mobile phase. The 12-min-long HPLC gradient was as follows: 5% acetonitrile for 30 s, ramp to 35% acetonitrile by 1.5 min to 2.5 min, and return to 5% acetonitrile by 2.51 min. The dU-containing fractions were collected from 1.6-1.7 min and vacuum centrifuged until dry. The pellets were redissolved in water and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a reverse phase column (2.1 mm x 150 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm, EclipsePlusC18 RRHD, Agilent Technologies) kept at 25 \u00b0C with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min on a 1290 Infinity II HPLC coupled to a 6495 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source (Agilent Technologies). Water and methanol were used as the mobile phase, each containing 0.1% formic acid. The 13-min-long HPLC gradient was as follows: 5% methanol for 3 min, ramp to 13% methanol by 3.5 min, ramp to 17% methanol by 5.5 min to 7 min and return to 5% methanol by 8 min. Analysis was performed in positive ionization multiple reaction monitoring mode, using the mass transitions 229.08 \u2192 113.0 and 232.08 \u2192 116.0 for 2\u00b4-deoxyuridine (dU),\n13\nC\n15\nN\n2\n-dU, respectively. Unmodified nucleosides were measured on an API5500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with a reverse phase column at room temperature (Zorbax SB-C18 2.1 mm \u00d7 150 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm, Agilent Technologies). The HPLC method used a flow rate of 300 \u00b5L/min with an isocratic flow of 25% B for 2 min with the column heated to 40 \u00b0C. The mass transitions used were 252.1 \u2192 136, 228.1 \u2192 111.9, 268.1\u2192152, and 243.1\u2192127 m/z for dA, dC, dG, and dT, respectively."
