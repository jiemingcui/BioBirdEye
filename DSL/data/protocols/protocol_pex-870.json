            "content": "<p>\tStream mesocosms are medium sized (1 to 1000-L) test systems designed to simulate real stream ecosystems. They fill a crucial gap from traditional bioassay techniques to identify, quantify and assess multiple stressors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laboratory toxicity studies (e.g., LC50), can pinpoint toxicity concentrations, however, studies are traditionally done on single species, and experimental setup does not allow for the interaction of other environmental variables with the test organisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Field studies can assess effects on aquatic communities, however, in the natural environment it is often difficult to determine cause, as the quantities and interactions between multiple stressors, environment variables and exposure pathways often interact and confound conventional approaches.</p><p>\t</p><p>\tMesocosms are a hybrid of field and laboratory techniques that allow for the control of stressors (single, or multiple), and of key environmental parameters, such as water temperature and water chemistry, light and diel temperature cycles, that occur naturally to create greater field relevance than laboratory tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;These types of studies tend to generate high quality biological data the results of which can then be used in applications such as environmental risk assessment. Some of the most significant whole-ecosystem experiments that have ever been conducted were only possible after extensive mesocosm studies (Schindler 1998).&nbsp;&nbsp;The system described below has tested the effects of the interactions of multiple stressors on small fish, benthic macroinvertebrate and periphyton communities and continues to be an important tool for environmental risk assessment (European Commission 2014) (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\t</p><p>\tAquatic macroinvertebrate communities are ideal for assessing environmental degradation as they are highly sensitive, widespread and generally accessible for collection. Essential to ecosystem function, these organisms are also an integral part of the food web as they feed on leaf detritus and periphyton attached to cobble substrates.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is convenient, as&nbsp;</p><p>small cobbles are readily transported and inoculated into the artificial streams to serve as a natural and familiar food supply for introduced organisms. Macroinvertebrates also serve as important foodstuffs for many fish species.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>\tAlthough some small fish studies have been conducted in similarly sized systems; larger organisms tend to require larger streams (upwards of 300-L) which are more expensive to run and more difficult to operate and transport.&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, larger mesocosm installations sacrifice replication for large-scale, single-treatment mesocosms (e.g., marine mesocosms in Alexander et al. 2016).&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, the method described below favours replication over size.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our combined approach uses a weight-of-evidence technique to integrate findings from field and laboratory studies to offer insight in complex systems.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>There are four stages in a mesocosm study:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>study design</em>&nbsp;\u2013 initial considerations before the experiment starts, including: what type of experiment (press or pulse), sub/lethal, stressor(s) to be tested, concentration(s) of interest, randomization required, schedule, substrate and benthic community sourcing and procurement of necessary equipment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>setup&nbsp;</em>\u2013 getting the mesocosm ready for the experiment, including: site preparation, construction, mesocosm assembly, transport, establishment of treatments, cobble and gravel substrate inoculation, periphyton establishment as well as invertebrate community collection, subsampling, inoculation and establishment.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>routine maintenance</em>&nbsp;\u2013 maintaining and monitoring the mesocosms is required throughout the duration of the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes: water sampling, routine flow checks, modifying flow depending on treatment regime and emergent insect collection, and&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>takedown</em>&nbsp;\u2013 coordinating the end of the experiment, including: collection of final water samples, as well as preservation of benthic macroinvertebrates and periphyton communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up equipment and test site also occur during this stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>\tThe following procedure focuses on the setup stages of a mesocosm deployment including initial setup, power and water, substrate collection and macroinvertebrate inoculation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since mesocosms are very customizable, variations in design and approach will alter system layout, required equipment and supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp;More complex study designs in&nbsp;<strong>Associated Publications</strong>&nbsp;are all based on the artificial stream setup described in this protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next steps as well as suggestions for as to routine maintenance and takedown of this system are addressed in the&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>&nbsp;section.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

            "content": "3.1 Initial design and setup\nStudy site selection is based primarily on how accessible the test site is (e.g., availability of a level field of suitable size).\u00a0\u00a0Availability and quality of a water supply as well as the potential access to power are important considerations.\u00a0\u00a0Security of the study site can also be a factor because mesocosm studies typically run for extended periods (3 or more weeks).\u00a0\u00a0Thus, safe access to the site for the setup, experiment and takedown periods is required.\u00a0\u00a0Distance from the test site to a suitable location for collection of the test organisms and substrates should also be considered well in advance of deployment.\u00a0\u00a0Reconnaissance trip(s) to find the appropriate collection site well before the experiment is highly advisable.\u00a0\u00a0All biological collections should be at a reference area with representative diversity of organisms (Fig. 1a).\nOur modular mesocosm approach (\nFig. 2\n), was originally designed to be transported to test sites with groups of up to eight (8) replicate streams arranged on treatment tables (Fig. 2a).\u00a0\u00a0These treatments were initially attached to supporting wooden pallets for easy transport by forklift (see also Culp et al., 2003 in Assoc. Publications).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Early studies using this method focused on effluent gradients from pulp mills and metal mining to assist in the determination of underlying causes of toxicity in these industrial effluents (Environment Canada 2010; 2012).\u00a0\u00a0Subsequent experiments have looked at gradients of priority and emerging contaminants to determine safe levels of these substances in the environment or to unravel confounding results due to natural gradients such as nutrient masking of effects in field applications (Alexander et al. 2013).\nEach replicate stream has a planar area of 0.065 m\n2\nand a 10-L volume.\u00a0\u00a0Each cylinder independently simulates environmental flows while the shorter cylindrical design reduces edge effects on stream periphyton and macroinvertebrate communities (\nFig. 3\n).\u00a0\u00a0The rounded edges also allow for reduced wall growth, increased animal movement and better contaminant mixing.\u00a0\u00a0Rectangular tanks create backflows and unusual eddies that are widely thought to be more stressful for higher densities or more active organisms.\u00a0\u00a0The implications of scale to environmental problems using mesocosms is reviewed in Petersen et al. (2009).\u00a0\u00a0Often, however, the weaknesses of the system appear to be directly linked to weaknesses in the study design.\u00a0\u00a0This issue is not unique to mesocosm studies.\n3.2 Power and Water\nRiver or treatment water is fed into the polyethylene table reservoir before it\u2019s drawn towards the circulation (March) pump (\nFig. 4\n). The water flows through the lower valve of the table reservoir into the March pump where it is pumped into the treatment manifold intake. The second manifold intake is connected to one of the upper valves on the table reservoir which is closed to create system pressure.\u00a0\u00a0From the treatment manifold, the water is pushed through the lower hose barbs into each of the stream mesocosms. The water then enters the artificial stream, fills up the cylindrical basin while a motorized stirrer rotates internal paddles to generate instream flow conditions similar to 2\nnd\nto 4\nth\norder streams. Water then overflows the basin emptying onto the tray where it then drains back into the table reservoir via two cylindrical funnels built into the tray (Fig. 4). Water is exchanged in each replicate stream is typically exchanged every 7-min.\u00a0\u00a0The tray discharge then either returns to the reservoir for continued recirculation while the reservoir is completely exchanged every 1-4 hours depending on the temperature needs of the study design.\u00a0\u00a0Waste water (either from the table or the reservoir tank) is transported through solid black corrugated loom tubing to a separate wastewater holding tank.\u00a0\u00a0Wastewater is then passed through carbon filters (e.g., Culligan Inc., activated carbon filter cylinder, Moncton, NB, Canada) to remove contaminants before any water is discharged to the environment.\n3.3 Substrate and benthic macroinvertebrate community collection\nPrior to initiating the experiment, benthic substrates are introduced into each replicate stream. Inoculating each stream with a mixture of gravel (fine and coarse) and cobblestones creates an ideal substrate for benthic macroinvertebrates. Gravel and cobble should be collected from a pristine site (e.g., un-impacted location). Mixture of substrate sizes should also reflect the simulated riverine habitat to be tested and preferably be collected near (e.g., downstream) of the benthic macroinvertebrate collection site.\u00a0\u00a0Cobble should also be gently hand washed to remove attached invertebrates while maintaining the preexisting periphyton community. This procedure establishes a lotic substrate consisting of a 2-3 cm layer of gravel plus surface cobblestones covered with periphyton similar to the original habitat of the benthic community examined.\n3.3.1 Collection of substrates\nUse shovels for gravel substrates collection.\u00a0\u00a0Fine and coarse gravel are shoveled, sieved and transported to the mesocosm test site.\u00a0\u00a0Transfer should be done relatively quickly, as the biofilm on each rock is alive and vulnerable to desiccation or compositional shifts with changing water temperature.\nEach replicate stream receives the same volume of fine and coarse gravel of the volume and size measurements below (see Fig. 1c).\u00a0\u00a0Mix gently by hand to evenly distribute the amounts of fine and coarse gravel in each replicate stream (Fig. 1d, 3b, 4).\nEach replicate stream receives:\n250 mL of >2mm to <4 mm of fine gravel\n750 mL of >4 mm to <9.5\nmm of coarse gravel\nThus, to inoculate 32 streams with substrate:\n8-L total, of >2mm to <4 mm of fine gravel is needed (250 ml x 32)\n24-L total of >4 mm to <9.5\nmm of coarse gravel is needed (750 ml x 32)\n3.3.2 Collection of cobble substrates\nTypically, in a separate trip, cobbles (5-8 cm in diameter) are collected for each artificial stream. Cobbles will be carefully selected from the stream bottom, gently hand rinsed, and inspected to remove visible invertebrates with a minimum disturbance of the biofilm. Place cobble in a cooler maintaining original rock orientation with algae covered side facing up.\u00a0\u00a0Cobble should be covered in water during transport to maintain periphyton community.\nWe recommend 5 cobbles (approximately 5-8 cm diameter) be placed in each replicate stream on top of the gravel substrate. Systematic allocation of cobbles to each stream is recommended to minimize size bias.\u00a0\u00a0Allow 3-5 days for periphyton colonization, dependent on ambient temperatures before inoculating macroinvertebrates to prevent starvation.\n3.3.3 Collection and inoculation of macroinvertebrates\nThe benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage should be collected from a single riffle (e.g., < 10 x 10 m, water depth < 30 cm).\u00a0\u00a0Collecting the benthic community from a small defined area reduces the high inherent variability in diversity and abundance.\u00a0\u00a0The collection site should be near, preferably upstream of the gravel and cobble collection site (without being in the disturbance zone) as the organisms will already be acclimated to nearby substrate and its biofilm.\u00a0\u00a0In our research, we have at times used the same collection site for several years further increasing our understanding of that system and the organisms that reside there as well as facilitating comparisons between experiments over time.\nThe benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage should also be collected using a sampling device with a known area to facilitate an overstocking of ~10-20% in the event of any mortality due to handling or transport of organisms to the test site (Fig. 1b). We have used U-nets (area = 0.06 m\n2\n) for this purpose and have developed a subsampling procedure to inoculate as similar a benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage into each replicate stream at the test site as possible (Fig. 1).\u00a0\u00a0This subsampling process has been described in detail elsewhere (e.g., Alexander et al. 2013; see also Associated Publications).\u00a0\u00a0In brief, the subsampling procedure consists of collecting a series of U-nets by a team of samplers working together (Fig. 1a).\u00a0\u00a0The number of U-nets is determined by the need to overstock by ~10% to offset any mortality of macrobenthos in the transport from the river to the test site.\u00a0\u00a0For example, if 100 streams are to be inoculated, 110 U-nets would be required.\u00a0\u00a0Both the number of streams to be inoculated and how many subsamples can easily be \u2018split\u2019 in the subsampler alter the number of subsamples required (e.g., see 4-way pie plate subsamples in Fig. 1b).\u00a0\u00a0As the number of streams used in an experiment depends on the replication required\na priori\npower analyses is highly recommended to determine whether expected effects would be detectable given the variability in the subsampled community.\u00a0\u00a0Please also note, other types of nets can also be used for collections but the relative density of organisms in the test system should not be greater than 20% overstocked compared to the riverine community.\nOnce macroinvertebrates are collected, sample containers must be kept cool and transported to the mesocosm site as quickly as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Minimizing water temperature differences between the river water and the artificial stream water is highly recommended.\u00a0\u00a0Once the macroinvertebrates are at the test site, they should be transferred into individual artificial streams using a randomized pattern.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to make note of which artificial stream receives which subsample to help with later data interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0Turning off the motorized stirrer (Fig 1c,d; 3a,b) also helps invertebrates to settle into the substrate unimpeded during the inoculation transfer.\u00a0\u00a0Once macroinvertebrates are introduced, attach emergence traps (e.g., 400 Nitex\u00a9 mesh, Aquatic Ecosystems Inc., Apopka, FL, U.S.A.) or other barriers to prevent invertebrate escapees (e.g., Fig. 2a).\u00a0\u00a0Introduce treatments only after all of the above is functioning as expected.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, allow ~2 days for macroinvertebrates to settle before initiating treatment."

The flow of water is as follows:  source water is fed into (a) the polyethylene table reservoir (b) then drawn from the lower valve towards the circulation (March) pump (c).  Water is then pumped into the treatment manifold intake (d) and pushed through the lower hose barbs onto the table above (e) and into each replicate stream (f).  Water then overflows the basin emptying back onto the table tray (e) where it can then drain back into the table reservoir (a) via two cylindrical funnels within the floor of the tray.  Water can be recirculated from the reservoir or discharged as waste (g).  In a typical setup water is completely exchanged from the table reservoir every 1 to 4 hours depending on the temperature needs of the study.  Water exchange in each replicate stream is much faster and can be in the range of every 7 minutes (see Associated Publications).  Additional schematics can be found here: Scaled drawings.",

        "manuscriptAbstract": "<p>Mesocosms are outdoor experimental systems designed to separate and test environmental responses, in this case, cumulative effects to field-collected periphyton and macroinvertebrate communities from multiple stressors.&nbsp;&nbsp;This experimental system produces valuable, highly reproducible data, and along with field monitoring, laboratory bioassays and modeling results, provides a strong weight-of-evidence approach for aquatic risk assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the control of confounding environmental variables, this type of experiment permits the separation of interactions between multiple stressors in complex effluents or due to shifting ambient conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The system described is modular and was originally developed to facilitate transport of the entire system to remote or industrial test sites (e.g., for&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;21-d chronic level testing). However, this setup is also appropriate for long term installations with suitable provision for routine maintenance and losses associated with regular wear-and-tear on equipment. The following protocol details a basic stream mesocosm system setup (e.g., 4 replicate streams per treatment-level) which is the foundation for the more than a dozen stream mesocosm experiments conducted by the authors since the 1990s.&nbsp;</p>",
