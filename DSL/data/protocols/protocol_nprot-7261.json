            "content": "Cardiac valves are affected in up to one third of cardiac congenital diseases1. Valves emerge early in mouse and human embryos \\(E9.5 and 4 weeks, respectively) in two restricted heart territories, the atrioventricular canal and the outflow tract from a process of endothelio-to-mesenchymal transition \\(EMT) of endocardial cells. Mouse models have provided a tremendous knowledge  as to biological processes and cell lineages  that contribute to valve formation2-3.  However, these in vivo models could not allow to easily studying signaling interaction, cell metabolism, epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, and mechano-transduction. In addition, human valve formation could at least in part be different from mouse. A human specific cell model of valvulogenesis that could be extended to cells derived from individual patients would definitively advance the understanding of developmental mechanisms driving valvulogenesis in health and disease. Herein we use pluripotent stem cells and report a protocol of cell differentiation toward endocardial cells and in turn to valvular cell types."

Cells are split 1/4 every 4-5 days when 80-90  % confluency is reached. MEF at P4 are treated for 1H30-2H with 10 ug/ml mitomycin C, then washed twice with DPBS and collected after 5 min Trypsin.  Cells are plated at 40 000 cells/cm2 for pluripotent stem cells propagation on gelatin-coated plates or 10 000 cells/cm2 for cell differentiation on fibronectin-coated plates \\(coating for 30 min at 37\u00b0C).\r\n\n\nTIP:  this culture protocol is important as MEF go to replicative senescence easily if grown at a wrong density.\r\n\n\nTIP: MEF can be frozen at any passage between P0 and P4 in DMEM/50%FCS/10%DMSO\r\n\n\nCulture of pluripotent stem cells:\r\n\n\n1. Culture the pluripotent stem cells in the propagation medium on a layer of mitotically-arrested mouse embryonic fibroblasts \\(40 000 cells/cm2).  \r\n  Critical: change every 24 hrs the medium with prewarmed \\(37\u00b0C) medium and check the absence of mycoplasma in the culture on a regular basis \r\n\n\n2. To start cell differentiation, plate the pluripotent stem cells on low density MEF \\(10 000 cells/cm2). \r\n  Critical: Start with cells featuring small colonies \\(200-500 cells) the next day after passaging or two days post-passaging \r\n\n\n3. Prepare a 35 mm plate as a control plate to follow the differentiation and for ant-CD15alexa \\(MC488) alive staining the day before sorting.\r\n  4. Day 0: Add to the differentiation medium either 100ng/ml Wnt3a or 5 uM CHIR 99021 \\(prewarm CHIR in your hands before adding it to the medium) and then change cell medium.\r\n  TIP: both procedures will activate wnt signaling pathways in the cells. \r\n\n\n5. Day 1: No later than 24Hrs later, change differentiation medium and add 100ng/ml Wnt3a or 5 uM CHIR99021, BMP2 10 ng/ml and 1 uM SU5402. \r\n  6. Day 2:  first check your cells and make sure they started to differentiate: the colonies should not be compact any longer; cells should spread out \\( see figure 1a below)\r\n  TIP: Make sure that all media are warmed at 37\u00b0C before adding to cells\r\n\n\nTIP: All stocks reagents growth factors, inhibitors should be stored at -20\u00b0C and should not be left at 4\u00b0C for more than 5 days \r\n\n\nTIP: Test cell differentiation by staining your 35 mm plate with 1/100 anti SSEA1 alexa488 \\(clone MC480)  in 400 ul PBS \\( see Figure 1b). If at least roughly 30% of cells are CD15+, you can sort out the cells the next day.\r\n\n\n7. Day 3:  anti-CD15 cell sorting \\(according to stem cell technologies protocol) \r\n  8. Plate sorted cells on feeders \\(10 000 MEF/cm2) on  fibronectin-coated plates \\(fibronectin 1mg/ml Sigma diluted 1/100 in PBS to coat plates for 1hr at 37\u00b0C)  in RPMI-B27  added with 30 ng/ml VEGF  and 10 ng/ml FGF8 \\(and 2 ng/mL FGF2).\r\n  TIP: 300000 cells /B6 plate is a good number to start the culture \r\n\n\n9. Days 4 to 9:  change medium at D6 and D8 with the same medium +VEGF/FGF8/\\(FGF2)\r\n  10. Day 9: Sort the cells with anti-CD31 \\(Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer protocol and plate them in ECGM with VEGF 30 ng/ml on collagen-coated plate \\(plates are coated at RT for 1 hrs with collagen \\(stock 3 mg/ml diluted 1/60 in acetic acid) . Wash twice the collagen coated plate with PBS before plating the cells.  Plate 300 000 cells/well of a 6 wells plate. Let grow the cells for 5 more days, change medium every 2 days.  Cells can be split and will remain \u201cendothelial\u201d  for 2-3 passages\r\n  TIP: add 1U/ml heparin to the ECGM medium. This will help preventing spontaneous EMT. \r\n\n\nTIP: Cells can be tracked by Anti-CD31 staining \\(Immunofluorescence \\(Figure 2 or FACS) \r\n\n\n11. Day 9 or later: induce EMT with 100 ng/ml BMP2 in differentiation medium.

Chondrogenic differentiation can be performed according to established methods4. \r\n  Endocardial cells are isolated from MEF using collagenase IV, transferred into 15 mL of polypropylene centrifuge tubes \\(500 000 cells/tube) and gently centrifuged at 80 g. The resulting pellets have to be  statically cultured for 3 weeks in DMEM high-glucose medium with glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin and chondrogenic supplements \\(1X ITS-G, 1 \uf06dumol/L dexamethasone, 100 \uf06dmol/L ascorbic acid-2-phosphate), and 10 ng/mL TGF-b1.\r\n\n\n13.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Genetically modified mice have advanced our understanding of valve development and related pathologies. Yet, little is known regarding human valvulogenesis in health and diseases. Genuine human in vitro models that reproduce valvular \\(patho)biology are thus needed. We here developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived model fit to decode the early steps of human valvulogenesis and to recapitulate valve disease traits in a dish. \r\n\n\nUsing cellular based, single cell omics-informed and in vivo-validated approaches, we derived a population of pre-valvular endocardial cells from a pluripotent stem cell source. These human prevalvular cells \\(HPVCs) expressed gene patterns conforming to the atrio-ventricular canal \\(AVC) endocardium signature originally established in E9.0 mouse embryos. In fact, HPVC treated with BMP2, cultured onto mouse AVC cushions, or transplanted into the AVC of embryonic mouse hearts, underwent endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and expressed markers of valve interstitial cells of different valvular layers demonstrating tissue functionality. HPVCs also differentiated into tendinous/chondrogenic cells in line with the valvular repertoire. Extending this valvulogenic model to patient specific iPS cells, we recapitulated features of mitral valve prolapse and uncovered that dysregulation of the SHH pathway is likely to be at the origin of the disease thus providing a putative therapeutic target.\r\n\n\nHuman pluripotent stem cells recapitulate early valvulogenesis and provide a powerful model to systematically decipher the origin and lineage contribution of different valvular cell types in humans as well as to study valve diseases in a dish.",
