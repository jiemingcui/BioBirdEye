            "content": "Inversions frequently result from non allelic homologous recombination between long \\(&gt;10kb) inverted repeats, making them difficult to detect with long PCR or RFLP analysis. We have developed PCR-based single molecule haplotyping methods that enable both surveys for novel inversion variants, and population-scale genotyping of known inversions \\(Turner _et al_ 2006).\r\n\n\nThe inversion genotype of an individual can be deduced from their genomic DNA if single molecule haplotyping is performed on the DNA fragments that span the inversion breakpoints. Fusion PCR \\(Yon and Fried 1989) allows sequences at either side of an inversion breakpoint to be joined together, and performing the reaction in an oil : water emulsion \\(Ghadessy _et al_ 2001) ensures that the DNA templates are single molecules in the overwhelming majority of cases. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn practice, the haplotyping method used depends on the length of the inverted repeat relative to the size of DNA fragments in the genomic DNA preparation. If the repeat is shorter than the template fragment lengths \\(around 100kb), single copy sequences on either side of an inverted repeat can be joined and the inversion genotyped by generating fused products of different sizes for the two orientations. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor longer repeats, paralog-specific nucleotides are analysed in a magnetic bead-based version of the assay."

            "content": "The given protocol is used when the inverted repeats that give rise to the inversion are short \\(&lt;100 kb). For longer repeats it is necessary to quantify the fusion PCR products and to use bead-based PCR in emulsion followed by single base extension and microscopy. This increases the length of time for the procedure considerably.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n1. The use of a polymerase that does not leave an A-tail is unnecessary for the technique to work but not doing so can affect subsequent steps.\r\n  2i. Preparing larger volumes of oil phase \\(e.g. 20 ml) can help to avoid pipetting inconsistencies caused by the high viscosity of the components. \r\n\n\n2ii. Stirring speed is just estimated from looking at the dial. \r\n\n\n3. Addition of occasional drops sooner or later than after 5 seconds does not seem to affect the stability of the emulsion significantly.\r\n  4. It is probably not necessary to overlay reactions with mineral oil. No special cycling conditions are required. \r\n  5. Following cycling some separation of the emulsion usually occurs. The degree of separation is affected by precise stirring speed and the rate of aqueous phase addition. It is important to perform the hexane cleanup on the thick, opaque emulsion and to leave any clear liquid at the bottom of the tube untouched. The mineral oil on top of the emulsion can be included in the cleanup. It is probably fine to perform a single hexane step. Ethoxy ethane can be used instead of hexane, and is more efficient at disrupting emulsions but presents more of a potential hazard.\r\n  6. Because the efficiency of performing a single step fusion PCR in an emulsion is low, PCR products will probably not be visible in a gel even after ethanol precipitation and running of the entire reaction, so reamplification with just the outer primers is necessary to increase the quantity of fused product. Dilution of fused PCR products gives cleaner products after reamplification. Reamplification can be performed using a standard polymerase."
