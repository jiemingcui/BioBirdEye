            "content": "Human embryonic stem \\(hES) cells1 and human induced pluripotent \\(hiPS) cells2, 3 have great potential as a possible source of cells for the regenerative medical transplantation of various tissues and also for other research applications, such as developmental biology, toxicology, and drug discovery. Today, a number of hES and hiPS cell lines have been established around the world. To promote these great potential researches using hES and hiPS cell lines, the prerequisite is the foundation of cell banks of well-characterized and safety-tested cells for research which serve as seed stocks for therapeutic applications. Currently, several cell banks are distributing such cell lines all over the world. The International Stem Cell Banking Initiative has developed a consensus on the principles of best practice for the banking, testing, and distribution of hES cells4, 5, 6, 7, 8. During cell banking, although most of the procedures share many of the principles of routine cell culture, a number of significant steps exist in the case of hES and hiPS cells. One of them is cryopreservation9. \r\n\n\nBoth hES and hiPS cells have been well-known to be sensitive to the cryopreservation9, 10, 11. Two cryopreservation methods are commonly used for hES and hiPS cells which are vitrification12, 13, 14, 15 and slow freezing16, 17, 18, 19. At this moment, vitrification method is considered to be preferable for the local storage because of the high survival rate12, 15, 16, 20. However, vitrified cells can be terribly damaged upon failure of rapid-warming process without practiced hand compared to slow-frozen cells. Furthermore, if the low temperature is not strictly maintained, cell viability decreases rapidly. Therefore, when vitrified cells are transported, it needs liquid nitrogen dry-shippers with careful documentation for the regulatory requirements and transports companies with technical expertise to undertake such shipments, resulting in the high costs involved. As for slow-freezing method with dimethyl sulfoxide \\(DMSO), although it has been long trusted as a stable cryopreservation for a wide variety of cells including mouse ES cells, it produces low levels of recovery or spontaneously differentiation for hES and hiPS cells. \r\n\n\nUntil now, several approaches have been investigated for the improvement of cryopreservation for hES and hiPS cells such as the technique based on stabilizing hES colonies adherent to or embedded in a Matrigel matrix17, and the protocol using of Rho-associated kinase \\(ROCK) inhibitor21, 22. Considering clinical application of hES and hiPS cells, xeno-free defined freezing medium should be required. An effective serum- and xeno-free chemically defined freezing procedure was reported by Hovatta\u2019s group23. Another group has proposed in situ cryopreservation using gas permeable culture casettes24. However, there is not any evidence that the cells can stably preserve their phenotypes for more than 10 years, excluding the conventional cryopreservation of the cells with DMSO. Thus, it is suggested that although these new methods would be worth to be challenged, the conventional cryopreservation should be backed up as a precaution. \r\n\n\nWe here show that a simple modification of the conventional slow freezing cryopreservation with 10% DMSO increased cell viability after thawing. This method requires neither specific equipment nor reagents and only the thawing way is changed, but resulting cells have comparable growth ability to those of vitrified cells. Even when using defined medium, such as our growth factor defined medium hESF925, 26, 27, 28, or Thomson\u2019s mTeSR medium29, this method could work well. Because the conventional slow freezing cryopreservation is quite familiar, this simple method would gain widespread acceptance."

            "content": "Passaging of hES/iPS cells:\r\n\n\nMaintain WA09 and JCRB1331 cells on feeder layers of mitomycin C-treated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts \\(PMEF) in gelatin-coated 25 cm2 tissue flasks. Passage colonies every 5-7 days depending on colony growth. Exchange culture medium every day except the day following the passaging.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFreeze stock of hES/iPS Cells:\r\n\n\n1. Remove the differentiated area completely by using the Pasteur pipette in advance.\r\n  2. Examine all the plates containing hES/iPS Cells by inverted phase-contrast microscopy. Cultures used for cryopreservation should show no signs of microbial contamination and should be subconfluent \\(the distance between the colonies is < 10-20% of the average colony diameter). Confluent cultures may be less amenable to freezing. \r\n  3. Label cryogenic vials with the name of the cell line, passage number, lot number and the date.\r\n  4. Remove the culture medium from flasks.\r\n  5. Add 1.5 ml dispase \\(1U/ml) per the T25 flask and incubate for 2-5 min until the edges of the colonies start to curl.\r\n  CRITICAL: Treatment time of dispase varies and depends on the cell lines and quality of colonies used.6. Gently scrape with scraper and pipetting with 10 ml pipette so as not to be small clumps. \r\n\n\nCRITICAL: Cell colonies should not be disrupted in small size. \r\n\n\n7. Transfer to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and spin at 20 X g, 2 min, 4 \u00b0C.\r\n  CRITICAL: It is recommended to centrifuge at low g forces \\(20 x g) to prevent feeder cells collecting at the bottom of the tube together.\r\n\n\n8. Carefully aspirate supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. \r\n  CRITICAL: Finger tap the tube gently to disperse the pellet.\r\n\n\n9. Resuspend the cells in freshly prepared ice-cold freezing medium \\(10% DMSO/culture medium).\r\n  CRITICAL: The freezing medium should be prepared freshly and kept on ice before use.\r\n\n\n10. Transfer 200 \u00b5l aliquots into each labeled cryogenic vial.\r\n  CRITICAL: Small volume may result in higher cell survival rates. It is recommended the volume of fluid during cryopreservation is 200 ul rather than 500 ul.\r\n\n\n11. Place the vials on ice for a few minute.\r\n  CRITICAL: Vials are allowed to sit on ice for 15 min. A prolonged storage on ice is likely to cause a further decline of cell viability.\r\n\n\n12. Store them in the freezing container \\(BICELL or Mr.Frosty\u00ae) and keep it in a -80 \u00b0C deep freezer overnight. \r\n  CRITICAL: It is recommended to finish suspension within 30 min. Prolonged immersion cause decline in cell viability.\r\n\n\n13. Next day transfer the vials to the liquid nitrogen tank \\(in the vapor phase, -150 \u00b0C ).\r\n  CRITICAL: Immersion of vials into the liquid phase of liquid nitrogen may lead to viral or cross contamination.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL: It is recommended to abort long term storage in a -80 \u00b0C deep freezer. An extended storage at -80 \u00b0C causes the decline in cell recovery. Storage in a -80 \u00b0C deep freezer within 7 days after transferring from liquid nitrogen tank is permissible.  \r\n\n\nCRITICAL: It is reported that vitrification protocols may be superior to slow freezing. We showed our slow freezing method was equally successful as vitrification method. \r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT: The cells can be stored indefinitely in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen.\r\n\n\n14. Document the details of vials and storage location in the appropriate inventory.\r\n  \r\n\n\nPreparation of feeder seeded culture flasks before thawing of hES/hiPS cells \r\n\n\n15. Coat the flasks with 0.1% gelatin \\(3 ml/25 cm2 flask).\r\n  16. Incubate the flasks for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C or overnight at room temperature.\r\n  17. Rinse the flasks with PBS.\r\n  18. Inoculate mitomycin c-treated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts \\(PMEF) at 5-7x103 cells/cm2 in DMEM \\(high glucose) containing 10% heat inactivated FBS.\r\n  CRITICAL: Prepare the feeder seeded culture flasks in a few days in advance of the thawing or passaging of hES/hiPS cells, and use them within 5 days.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL: Density of feeder cells should be determined by colony morphology of hES/hiPS cells in advance.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThawing of hES/hiPs cells\r\n\n\n19. Prior to using of feeder seeded flasks, replace the medium with the human pluripotent cell medium twice.\r\n  20. Pre-warm 10 ml of the human pluripotent cell medium in a 15 ml tube in a 37 \u00b0C water bath.\r\n  21. Rapidly thaw out frozen cells by adding the pre-warmed medium directly into a vial with the transfer pipette.\r\n  CRITICAL: In a case of thawing the frozen cells in a 37 \u00b0C water bath or in a 37\u00b0C incubator, the cells may be seriously damaged.\r\n\n\n22. Gently collect the cells in the 15ml tube and wash vial with the pre-warmed medium.\r\n  23. Centrifuge the tube at 90x g, 2 min, room temperature.\r\n  24. Aspirate the medium and finger tap the tube gently to disperse the pellet.\r\n  25. Resuspend the cells in 5-7 ml of pre-warmed culture medium and transfer the suspension into a 25 cm2 flask.\r\n  26. Gently move the flask several times along horizontal and vertical directions to distribute the cells evenly.\r\n  27. Incubate the flasks in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\r\n  28. Culture medium should be exchanged every other day until hES/hiPS cells are ready for passaging.\r\n  CRITICAL: Do not move the flask on the day following the passaging.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAlkaline phosphatase staining to determine the growth of hiPS/hES cells\r\n\n\n29. Remove the culture medium and rinse once with PBS for 1 min at room temperature.\r\n  30. Fix the colonies with the fixation buffer for 1 min at room temperature.\r\n  31. Wash twice with DDW.\r\n  32. Start the color reaction by incubating in the reaction buffer blocking off the light.\r\n  33. Stop the reaction after 15 min by washing twice with DDW.\r\n  34.

        "manuscriptAbstract": "In this study, a simple method for the cryopreservation of human embryonic stem \\(ES) and induced pluripotent stem \\(iPS) cells is proposed. It is based on the conventional slow-freezing method with 10% DMSO and modified mainly in a thawing protocol without specific equipment or reagents. Recovery rate of the cells cryopreserved by this method was equally high, which is comparable to that of the cells frozen by the vitrification method. In the case of vitrification method, it requires practiced hand because cells can be terribly damaged upon failure of rapid-warming process and strict maintenance of low temperature is required throughout the cryopreservation. On the contrary, our method is available for novices and cryopreserved cells can maintain cell recovery rate for one week after transfer from -150 \u00b0C to -80 \u00b0C condition. This simple modified method would gain widespread acceptance.",
