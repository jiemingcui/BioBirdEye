            "content": "Malignant brain tumours are among the most devastating cancers with almost negligible survival rates. Although the fundamental biology and therapeutic investigations of brain tumours have been explored in a variety of experimental model systems, their survival rate has not improved in decades. In addition, brain tumours are characterized by a wide variety of DNA aberrations that either cause oncogene overexpression or loss of tumour suppressor gene function \\(McLendon et al., 2008; Parsons et al., 2011; Brennan et al., 2013), which is difficult to recapitulate using existing models. Thus, complementary models using state-of-the-art experimental model systems are required for brain tumour investigation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThree-dimensional organoid culture technology allows the development of complex, organ-like tissues reminiscent of in vivo development \\(Lancaster et al., 2013; Renner et al., 2017). Based on this cerebral organoid culture system, we introduced gene aberrations via two different genome-editing techniques, Sleeping Beauty transposon system \\(Ivics et al., 1997; M\u00e1t\u00e9s et al., 2009) for gain-of-function, and CRISPR-Cas9 system for loss-of-function \\(Ran et al., 2013; Sander and Joung, 2014). By combining those two genome-editing techniques, we could recapitulate a wide variety of tumorigenic events. This protocol introducing various combinations of clinical-relevant gene aberrations in cerebral organoids to mimic the brain tumour initiation provides us a powerful tool to study human brain tumour biology and to investigate therapeutic strategies."

For coating, low-growth-factor Matrigel \\(0.5 mg per 6-well plate) was dissolved in ice-cold DMEM/F12. FF hESCs were routinely splitted using 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022    FD hESCs\r\n\n\nFD hESCs were maintained with hESC medium containing 20 ng/ml FGF2/bFGF in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C on the gelatin- and MEF \\(1.87\u00d7105 cells/well)-coated 6-well cell culture plates. FD hESCs were routinely passaged using collagenase IV solution \\(0.1% wt/vol in H2O).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nB) Generation of Cerebral organoids\r\n\n\nDay 0, Embryoid body \\(EB) formation\r\n\n\n1. Single cell suspension was prepared as described previously using hESCs cultured in either feeder-independent or feeder-dependent manner \\(Lancaster et al., 2013).\r\n  2. Cell density was counted using automated cell counter. Nine thousand live cells/well in 150 \u00b5l hESC medium containing RI \\(1:100) and low FGF2/bFGF \\(1:2500, 4 ng/ml) were seeded in a 96-well low-attachment U-bottom cell culture plate. \r\n  \r\n\n\nDay 3, Exchanging medium\r\n\n\n3. The medium was exchanged with fresh hESC medium without RI and FGF2/bFGF.\r\n  \r\n\n\nDay 5 or 6, Neural induction \\(NI)\r\n\n\n4. hESC medium was replaced by NI medium to induce neural lineage differentiation when the sizes of EBs are more than 500 \u00b5m.\r\n  \r\n\n\nDay 5 or 6 to Day 11 or 12, Neuroectoderm expansion\r\n\n\n5. NI medium was exchanged every second days with fresh NI medium for 6 days.\r\n  \r\n\n\n             \\! Attention: EBs with expanded radialized neuroepithelial structure were selected for the further procedure.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 11 or 12, Nucleofection of plasmid cocktails to introduce gene mutations/amplifications\r\n\n\n6. Nucleofector solution is prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol by mixing 82 \u00b5l of solution 1 and 18 \u00b5l of supplement 1 for one reaction. Maximum 5 \u00b5g of plasmid cocktail, including 500 ng of transposase expression vector pCAG-SB100X, 1 \u00b5g of transposon vector for pCAG-eGFP, and 1 \u00b5g of each transposon vectors to express oncogene and/or CRISPR-Cas9 vectors were added into nucleofector solution.\r\n  7. About 15 EBs were collected, washed with PBS, resuspended with nucleofection solution with plasmid cocktails, and transferred into nucleofection cuvettes. \r\n  \r\n\n\n\\! Attention: a) Using widened pipette tips to transfer EBs. b) Gentle operation is required for entire procedure to avoid the damage of EBs. c) More than 15 EBs performed with nucleofection using NucleofectorTM 2b \\(Lonza) will significantly reduce the nucleofection efficiency.\r\n\n\n8.   EBs in the nucleofection cuvettes were nucleofected under program A-023 using NucleofectorTM 2b.\r\n  9.   EBs in the nucleofection cuvettes were gently added 1 ml of NI medium, and poured out into 6-cm dishes containing NI medium, and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C for overnight.\r\n  \r\n\n\nDay 12 or 13, EB embedding\r\n\n\n10.  EBs were embedded into matrigel based on previous described procedure. Briefly, EBs were transferred onto parafilm in 6- or 10-cm petri dish. The excess medium was carefully removed. \r\n  11. EBs were embedded into a droplet of matrigel, and adjusted into the center of the droplet before the matrigel droplet solidifies. Embedded EBs then were incubated into 37 \u00b0C incubator for 20 min to solidify the matrigel.\r\n  12.  Differentiation medium \\(-A) was added onto EBs to wash embedded EBs off the parafilm. The parafilm was discarded from the petri dish.\r\n  13.  Embedded EBs were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C without shaking.\r\n  \r\n\n\nDay 16 or 17, Differentiation of cerebral organoids\r\n\n\n14.  Differentiation medium \\(-A) were replaced by differentiation medium \\(+A).\r\n  15. The dish was transferred onto an orbital shaker in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\nDay 16 or 17 to Day 40, Initiation of neoplastic cerebral organoids\r\n\n\n16. Medium was changed twice a week with differentiation medium \\(+A).\r\n  \r\n\n\nDay 40 and later, Neoplastic cerebral organoids selection for further analysis\r\n\n\n17. Neoplastic cerebral organoids with overgrowth of GFP-positive mutated cells will be collected for further analysis.\r\n  18. Differentiation medium \\(+A) was exchanged twice per week for neoplastic cerebral organoid culture to the desired age of collection for subsequent analyses such as immunofluorescence staining, RNA-seq, renal implantation, drug testing, and viral infection."

        "manuscriptAbstract": "Brain tumours are among the most lethal and devastating cancers. Their treatment is currently limited by the genetic heterogeneity and the incompleteness of available laboratory models. Cancer sequencing projects have identified large numbers of DNA aberrations in brain tumours. But their individual relevance for cancer initiation and progression cannot easily be addressed using existing models. Recently developed three-dimensional culture system that recapitulate early development of human brains, named cerebral organoids, allow us to study various human brain disorders. Here we describe a method combining genome-editing techniques and cerebral organoid culture system to initiate tumorigenesis. This protocol not only provides a platform to test the driver gene aberrations of brain tumours in a rapid, systematic manner, but also give us a great tool to study the initiation mechanism of various brain tumours, including region-specific brain tumour if the starting organoids were pre-patterned. This protocol accompanies Bian et al \\(10.1038/s41592-018-0070-7), Nature Methods, published online 23 July, 2018.",
