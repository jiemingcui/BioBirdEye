            "content": "Mast cells are now being understood as important intitiators and regulators in both innate and adaptive immunity in addition to their traditional roles in allergic and IgE-mediated immune responses.Transfection of primary leukocytes has traditionally been a challenging but much desired protocol. It allows not only the analysis of cells in a more natural state to a cell line system, it enables the direct comparison of, for example, transcriptional activity using luciferase reporters, in immune cells taken from genetically-altered mice. In addition, importantly it allows for \"rescue experiments\" in knockout cells as well as the ability to over-express or reconstitute wild-type and/or mutated constructs into wild-type or knockout cells for analysis of functional responses such as cytokine production, apoptosis, migration etc."

            "content": "1. Maturate mast cells from bone marrow using interleukin 3. Isolate bone from femurs and tibias of 8-12 Pac-1-/- and Pac-1+/+ week old mice.  Grow cells at 4\u00d710\n5\ncells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium \\(Life Technologies, Rockville) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum \\(HyClone, Logan), 100 \u03bcg each of penicillin and streptomycin per mL, 2mM L-glutamine \\(Life Technologies), 50 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1% HEPES and 5 ng/mL of recombinant murine IL-3 \\(Peprotech) for 4-6 weeks at 37\no\nC in 5% CO2.  By 4-6 weeks in culture, greater than 98% of cells should be c-kit and Fc\u03b5RI positive as assessed by fluorescein isothiocyanate \\(FITC)-labelled anti-c-kit \\(BD, Pharmingen) and anti-DNP IgE \\(Sigma) antibodies respectively using Flow Cytometry.  Cell morphology should also be assessed by cytospin and staining with giemsa and toluidine blue.  To stimulate, sensitise cells with anti-DNP IgE mAb \\(100 ng/mL, Sigma) for 18 hours, wash twice to remove unbound IgE and stimulate with 20 ng/mL of DNP-HSA \\(Sigma) for chosen times.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. For the measurement of transcriptional Elk-1 activity, transfect 4 x 10\n6\nBMMCs with 1.75 \u03bcg pG5E4D38\u2013Luc, 1.75 \u03bcg pSG-Gal-Elk-1 \\(both plasmids kindly provided by Dr. Peter Shaw, University of Nottingham, UK, Frost et al, 1997) and 1 \u03bcg of the lacZ-expression vector pCMV\u03b2 \\(Clonetech, to allow standardization of the measured luciferase activity) using solution T and an Amaxa nucleofector device \\(K\u00f6ln, Germany; set to program T-016). In addition, \u201cmock-transfect\u201dcells with PBS in order to measure the background luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase activities. This Elk-1 reporter system is based on a hybrid fusion protein consisting of the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and the transactivation domain of Elk-1 that binds via its Gal4 moiety to the pG5E4D38\u2013Luc plasmid and drives the transcription of the luciferase gene only if it is phosphorylated by ERK within its Elk-1 moiety \\(Kortenjann et al, 1994). \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. For the measurement of transcriptional NFAT:AP-1 activity, transfect BMMCs with 1 \u03bcg pCMV\u03b2 and 3.5 \u03bcg of the NFAT reporter plasmid pNFAT-Luc \\(kindly provided by Dr. Gerald Crabtree, Stanford University, Stanford, USA) as described above. This NFAT reporter carries three tandem copies of the distal NFAT:AP-1 composite element of the human IL-2 promotor \\(Durand et al, 1988), which were cloned upstream of the minimal IL-2 promotor \\(from position -89 to +51) and the luciferase reporter gene. Consequently, this reporter is only transactivated when both NFAT and AP-1 are present in the nucleus and assembled to a ternary complex \\(Fiering et al, 1990; Macian et al., 2001). This widely used reporter plasmid responds to all known NFAT family members and can be activated in a NFAT-dependent manner in a variety of cell types.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4.Following transfection with reporter plasmids, plate BMMCs in 3 mL culture medium \\(RPMI 1640 medium \\(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum \\(HyClone), 100 \u03bcg each of penicillin and streptomycin per mL, 2mM L-glutamine \\(Life Technologies), 50 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1% HEPES and 5 ng/mL of recombinant murine IL-3 \\(Peprotech)) and allow to recover for 24 h. Then sensitise with 100 ng/mL anti-DNP IgE antibodies for 18 hours. Subsequently, split the cells and either stimulate with 20 ng/mL DNP-HSA for 6 h \\(Elk-1) or 8 h \\(NFAT:AP-1) or leave untreated. Following stimulation, lyse the cells in luciferase lysis buffer \\(Promega) and determine the raw luciferase activities using a luciferase activity kit \\(Promega). As an internal control for transfection efficiency, measure the \u03b2-galactosidase \\(\u03b2-gal) activities using Galactostar and Galacton reagents \\(Tropix). The background \u03b2-gal activity of mock-transfected cells should be subtracted from the lysates of transfected BMMCs and the relative \u03b2-gal activity of each sample was calculated. In order to obtain the standardised luciferase activity, divide the luciferase activity of each sample by the corresponding relative \u03b2-gal activity.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5. For over-expression or rescue experiments, transfect mast cells with 2ug of WT Pac-1, C257S Pac-1 or pMIG vector control."
