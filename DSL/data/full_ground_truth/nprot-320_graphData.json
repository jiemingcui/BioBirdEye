      "text": "An intein mediated protein ligation (IPL) reaction is conducted by mixing the carrier protein (CP) and phosphopeptide (T3pThr, or Cdc2pTyr) in a molar ratio of at least 1:25 (CP: peptide). The reaction is usually carried out at 4\u00b0C for 16 h or at 25\u00b0C for 4 h, with ligation efficiencies typically in the range of 40%-75% when using purified peptides possessing an N-terminal cysteine. This extent of ligation usually requires the synthetic peptide to be present at a final concentration of 0.5-1.0 mM. The ligation reaction is evaluated by a shift of mobility of the LPP compared to the unligated CP on a Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE. Peptides can be stored in a powder form or as a stock solution (5-10 mM) at -80 \u00b0C. The excess of unligated free peptide can be removed by dialysis using a nitrocellulose filter or a Slide-a-lyzer. For a large scale purification of LPP, gel filtration or chromatography can be performed",
